    "abstract": "Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) are critical indicators of knee osteoarthritis\n(OA). Since they often appear as small, irregular structures with\nindistinguishable edges in knee magnetic resonance images (MRIs), effective\ndetection of BMLs in MRI is vital for OA diagnosis and treatment. This paper\nproposes a semi-supervised local anomaly detection method using mask inpainting\nmodels for identification of BMLs in high-resolution knee MRI, effectively\nintegrating a 3D femur bone segmentation model, a large mask inpainting model,\nand a series of post-processing techniques. The method was evaluated using MRIs\nat various resolutions from a subset of the public Osteoarthritis Initiative\ndatabase. Dice score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and pixel-level\nsensitivity, specificity, and accuracy showed an advantage over the\nmultiresolution knowledge distillation method-a state-of-the-art global anomaly\ndetection method. Especially, segmentation performance is enhanced on\nhigher-resolution images, achieving an over two times performance increase on\nthe Dice score and the IoU score at a 448x448 resolution level. We also\ndemonstrate that with increasing size of the BML region, both the Dice and IoU\nscores improve as the proportion of distinguishable boundary decreases. The\nidentified BML masks can serve as markers for downstream tasks such as\nsegmentation and classification. The proposed method has shown a potential in\nimproving BML detection, laying a foundation for further advances in\nimaging-based OA research.",

    "abstract": "Generating code via a LLM (rather than writing code from scratch), has\nexploded in popularity. However, the security implications of LLM-generated\ncode are still unknown. We performed a study that compared the security and\nquality of human-written code with that of LLM-generated code, for a wide range\nof programming tasks, including data structures, algorithms, cryptographic\nroutines, and LeetCode questions. To assess code security we used unit testing,\nfuzzing, and static analysis. For code quality, we focused on complexity and\nsize. We found that LLM can generate incorrect code that fails to implement the\nrequired functionality, especially for more complicated tasks; such errors can\nbe subtle. For example, for the cryptographic algorithm SHA1, LLM generated an\nincorrect implementation that nevertheless compiles. In cases where its\nfunctionality was correct, we found that LLM-generated code is less secure,\nprimarily due to the lack of defensive programming constructs, which invites a\nhost of security issues such as buffer overflows or integer overflows. Fuzzing\nhas revealed that LLM-generated code is more prone to hangs and crashes than\nhuman-written code. Quality-wise, we found that LLM generates bare-bones code\nthat lacks defensive programming constructs, and is typically more complex (per\nline of code) compared to human-written code. Next, we constructed a feedback\nloop that asked the LLM to re-generate the code and eliminate the found issues\n(e.g., malloc overflow, array index out of bounds, null dereferences). We found\nthat the LLM fails to eliminate such issues consistently: while succeeding in\nsome cases, we found instances where the re-generated, supposedly more secure\ncode, contains new issues; we also found that upon prompting, LLM can introduce\nissues in files that were issues-free before prompting.",

    "abstract": "The Superficial Alignment Hypothesis posits that almost all of a language\nmodel's abilities and knowledge are learned during pre-training, while\npost-training is about giving a model the right style and format. We re-examine\nthese claims by empirically studying the scaling behavior of post-training with\nincreasing finetuning examples and evaluating them using objective\ntask-specific standardized benchmarks. Through experiments with the Llama-3,\nMistral, and Llama-2 model families of multiple sizes, we observe that, similar\nto the pre-training scaling laws, post-training task performance scales as a\npower law against the number of finetuning examples. This power law\nrelationship holds across a broad array of capabilities, including mathematical\nreasoning, coding, instruction following, and multihop-reasoning. In addition,\nfor tasks like math and multihop reasoning, we observe that a handful of\nexamples merely align the model stylistically but do not saturate performance\non the benchmarks. Model performance is instead correlated with its reasoning\nability and it improves significantly with more examples, illustrating the need\nfor holistic evaluation programs leveraging objective benchmarks in addition to\nmeasurement of alignment to human preferences. We also observe that language\nmodels are not necessarily limited to using knowledge learned during\npre-training. With appropriate post-training, a model's ability to integrate\nnew knowledge greatly improves on downstream tasks like multihop\nquestion-answering.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their\ninherent probabilistic nature often leads to inconsistency and inaccuracy in\ncomplex problem-solving tasks. This paper introduces DANA (Domain-Aware\nNeurosymbolic Agent), an architecture that addresses these issues by\nintegrating domain-specific knowledge with neurosymbolic approaches. We begin\nby analyzing current AI architectures, including AutoGPT, LangChain ReAct and\nOpenAI's ChatGPT, through a neurosymbolic lens, highlighting how their reliance\non probabilistic inference contributes to inconsistent outputs. In response,\nDANA captures and applies domain expertise in both natural-language and\nsymbolic forms, enabling more deterministic and reliable problem-solving\nbehaviors. We implement a variant of DANA using Hierarchical Task Plans (HTPs)\nin the open-source OpenSSA framework. This implementation achieves over 90\\%\naccuracy on the FinanceBench financial-analysis benchmark, significantly\noutperforming current LLM-based systems in both consistency and accuracy.\nApplication of DANA in physical industries such as semiconductor shows that its\nflexible architecture for incorporating knowledge is effective in mitigating\nthe probabilistic limitations of LLMs and has potential in tackling complex,\nreal-world problems that require reliability and precision.",

    "abstract": "Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life.\nWhile deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these\ndisorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although\ndifferential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its\napplication in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite\nthe equally critical privacy concerns. This study is the first to investigate\nDP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing on the trade-offs between\nprivacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a large, real-world dataset\nof 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking participants, we observed\na maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training with DP with high privacy\nlevels. To highlight real-world privacy risks, we demonstrated the\nvulnerability of non-private models to explicit gradient inversion attacks,\nreconstructing identifiable speech samples and showcasing DP's effectiveness in\nmitigating these risks. To generalize our findings across languages and\ndisorders, we validated our approach on a dataset of Spanish-speaking\nParkinson's disease patients, leveraging pretrained models from healthy\nEnglish-speaking datasets, and demonstrated that careful pretraining on\nlarge-scale task-specific datasets can maintain favorable accuracy under DP\nconstraints. A comprehensive fairness analysis revealed minimal gender bias at\nreasonable privacy levels but underscored the need for addressing age-related\ndisparities. Our results establish that DP can balance privacy and utility in\nspeech disorder detection, while highlighting unique challenges in\nprivacy-fairness trade-offs for speech data. This provides a foundation for\nrefining DP methodologies and improving fairness across diverse patient groups\nin real-world deployments.",

Unfortunately, most\nexisting meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally,\nignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge\ntransfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source\nmeta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense\nreasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to\ndynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the\ncorresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The\ndifferences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses\nof source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the\npolicy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy\nnetwork is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task\nweight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed\nMeta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three\ncommonsense reasoning benchmark datasets.

Inspired by\nthe observations that the final prediction in vision transformers (ViTs) is\nonly based on a subset of most informative tokens, we take the novel step of\nenhancing the efficiency of SSM-based vision models through token-based\npruning. However, direct applications of existing token pruning techniques\ndesigned for ViTs fail to deliver good performance, even with extensive\nfine-tuning. To address this issue, we revisit the unique computational\ncharacteristics of SSMs and discover that naive application disrupts the\nsequential token positions. This insight motivates us to design a novel and\ngeneral token pruning method specifically for SSM-based vision models. We first\nintroduce a pruning-aware hidden state alignment method to stabilize the\nneighborhood of remaining tokens for performance enhancement. Besides, based on\nour detailed analysis, we propose a token importance evaluation method adapted\nfor SSM models, to guide the token pruning. With efficient implementation and\npractical acceleration methods, our method brings actual speedup. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computation\nreduction with minimal impact on performance across different tasks.

Recent state-of-the-art approaches use self-supervised features\nto represent images as graphs and solve a generalized eigenvalue system (i.e.,\nnormalized-cut) to generate foreground masks. While effective, this strategy is\nlimited by its attendant computational demands, leading to slow inference\nspeeds.

ProMerge not only yields competitive\nresults but also offers a significant reduction in inference time compared to\nstate-of-the-art normalized-cut-based approaches.

In this\npaper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal\nassumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of\nthe score functions, the total variation distance between the target and\ngenerated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic\nfactors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps.\nThis result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment.\nMoreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate\nimproves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data\ndistribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to\nunknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image\ndistributions.

Stacking enables efficient training by gradually growing the depth of\na model in stages and using layers from a smaller model in an earlier stage to\ninitialize the next stage. Although efficient for training, the model biases\ninduced by such growing approaches are largely unexplored. In this work, we\nexamine this fundamental aspect of gradual stacking, going beyond its\nefficiency benefits. We propose a variant of gradual stacking called MIDAS that\ncan speed up language model training by up to 40%. Furthermore we discover an\nintriguing phenomenon: MIDAS is not only training-efficient but surprisingly\nalso has an inductive bias towards improving downstream tasks, especially tasks\nthat require reasoning abilities like reading comprehension and math problems,\ndespite having similar or slightly worse perplexity compared to baseline\ntraining. To further analyze this inductive bias, we construct reasoning\nprimitives -- simple synthetic tasks that are building blocks for reasoning --\nand find that a model pretrained with stacking is significantly better than\nstandard pretraining on these primitives, with and without fine-tuning. This\nprovides stronger and more robust evidence for this inductive bias towards\nreasoning. These findings of training efficiency and inductive bias towards\nreasoning are verified at 1B, 2B and 8B parameter language models. Finally, we\nconjecture the underlying reason for this inductive bias by exploring the\nconnection of stacking to looped models and provide strong supporting empirical\nanalysis.",

    "abstract": "Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge,\nparticularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that\ncan be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously\ndifficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system,\nleading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that\nare difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in\ntasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and\ninterpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic\ndivisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically\nplausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and\nthat has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena.\nBy using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of\nunconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit\nwhen the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a\nsystem of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the\ncircuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit,\nand individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent\nweight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate\nempirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that\nORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient\nclipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time\nconstants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating\ngradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find\nthat ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image\nclassification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.",

    "abstract": "Voice Assistants (VAs) are popular for simple tasks, but users are often\nhesitant to use them for complex activities like online shopping. We explored\nwhether the vocal characteristics like the VA's vocal tone, can make VAs\nperceived as more attractive and trustworthy to users for complex tasks. Our\nfindings show that the tone of the VA voice significantly impacts its perceived\nattractiveness and trustworthiness. Participants in our experiment were more\nlikely to be attracted to VAs with positive or neutral tones and ultimately\ntrusted the VAs they found more attractive. We conclude that VA's perceived\ntrustworthiness can be enhanced through thoughtful voice design, incorporating\na variety of vocal tones.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has\nrecently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging\ntheir inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual\nreasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language\nModels (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for\nunderstanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the\nsubstantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding\ncompared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images,\nshort videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event\ntemporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with\nbetween-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to\ntrace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to\nlong video understanding. We review the differences among various visual\nunderstanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding,\nincluding more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and\nlong-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements\nin MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for\nunderstanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing\nMM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss\npotential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.",

TimeMixer utilizes a\nmultiscale-mixing approach that effectively captures both short-term and\nlong-term temporal patterns by analyzing data across different scales. My\nempirical results reveal that while TimeMixer performs exceptionally well in\nshort-term volatility forecasting, its accuracy diminishes for longer-term\npredictions, particularly in highly volatile markets. These findings highlight\nTimeMixer's strength in capturing short-term volatility, making it highly\nsuitable for practical applications in financial risk management, where precise\nshort-term forecasts are critical.

    "abstract": "Learning a discriminative model to distinguish a target from its surrounding\ndistractors is essential to generic visual object tracking. Dynamic target\nrepresentation adaptation against distractors is challenging due to the limited\ndiscriminative capabilities of prevailing trackers. We present a new visual\nPrompting mechanism for generic Visual Object Tracking (PiVOT) to address this\nissue. PiVOT proposes a prompt generation network with the pre-trained\nfoundation model CLIP to automatically generate and refine visual prompts,\nenabling the transfer of foundation model knowledge for tracking. While CLIP\noffers broad category-level knowledge, the tracker, trained on\ninstance-specific data, excels at recognizing unique object instances. Thus,\nPiVOT first compiles a visual prompt highlighting potential target locations.\nTo transfer the knowledge of CLIP to the tracker, PiVOT leverages CLIP to\nrefine the visual prompt based on the similarities between candidate objects\nand the reference templates across potential targets. Once the visual prompt is\nrefined, it can better highlight potential target locations, thereby reducing\nirrelevant prompt information. With the proposed prompting mechanism, the\ntracker can generate improved instance-aware feature maps through the guidance\nof the visual prompt, thus effectively reducing distractors. The proposed\nmethod does not involve CLIP during training, thereby keeping the same training\ncomplexity and preserving the generalization capability of the pretrained\nfoundation model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks indicate\nthat PiVOT, using the proposed prompting method can suppress distracting\nobjects and enhance the tracker.",

Leveraging\nartificial intelligence (AI) is beneficial in addressing this challenge.\nCryptocurrency markets, marked by substantial growth and volatility, attract\ninvestors and scholars keen on deciphering and forecasting cryptocurrency price\nmovements. The vast and diverse array of data available for such predictions\nincreases the complexity of the task. In our study, we introduce a novel\napproach termed hard and soft information fusion (HSIF) to enhance the accuracy\nof cryptocurrency price movement forecasts. The hard information component of\nour approach encompasses historical price records alongside technical\nindicators. Complementing this, the soft data component extracts from X\n(formerly Twitter), encompassing news headlines and tweets about the\ncryptocurrency. To use this data, we use the Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT)-based sentiment analysis method,\nfinancial BERT (FinBERT), which performs best. Finally, our model feeds on the\ninformation set including processed hard and soft data. We employ the\nbidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model because processing\ninformation in both forward and backward directions can capture long-term\ndependencies in sequential information. Our empirical findings emphasize the\nsuperiority of the HSIF approach over models dependent on single-source data by\ntesting on Bitcoin-related data. By fusing hard and soft information on Bitcoin\ndataset, our model has about 96.8\\% accuracy in predicting price movement.\nIncorporating information enables our model to grasp the influence of social\nsentiment on price fluctuations, thereby supplementing the technical\nanalysis-based predictions derived from hard information.",

However, ECG signals are susceptible to noise\ncontamination, such as electrical interference or signal wandering, which\nreduces diagnostic accuracy. Various ECG denoising methods have been proposed,\nbut most existing methods yield suboptimal performance under very noisy\nconditions or require several steps during inference, leading to latency during\nonline processing. In this paper, we propose a novel ECG denoising model,\nnamely Mamba-based ECG Enhancer (MECG-E), which leverages the Mamba\narchitecture known for its fast inference and outstanding nonlinear mapping\ncapabilities. Experimental results indicate that MECG-E surpasses several\nwell-known existing models across multiple metrics under different noise\nconditions. Additionally, MECG-E requires less inference time than\nstate-of-the-art diffusion-based ECG denoisers, demonstrating the model's\nfunctionality and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently determining the satisfiability of a boolean equation -- known as\nthe SAT problem for brevity -- is crucial in various industrial problems.\nRecently, the advent of deep learning methods has introduced significant\npotential for enhancing SAT solving. However, a major barrier to the\nadvancement of this field has been the scarcity of large, realistic datasets.\nThe majority of current public datasets are either randomly generated or\nextremely limited, containing only a few examples from unrelated problem\nfamilies. These datasets are inadequate for meaningful training of deep\nlearning methods. In light of this, researchers have started exploring\ngenerative techniques to create data that more accurately reflect SAT problems\nencountered in practical situations. These methods have so far suffered from\neither the inability to produce challenging SAT problems or time-scalability\nobstacles. In this paper we address both by identifying and manipulating the\nkey contributors to a problem's ``hardness'', known as cores. Although some\nprevious work has addressed cores, the time costs are unacceptably high due to\nthe expense of traditional heuristic core detection techniques. We introduce a\nfast core detection procedure that uses a graph neural network. Our empirical\nresults demonstrate that we can efficiently generate problems that remain hard\nto solve and retain key attributes of the original example problems. We show\nvia experiment that the generated synthetic SAT problems can be used in a data\naugmentation setting to provide improved prediction of solver runtimes.",

Our segmentation model achieved\nstate-of-the-art accuracy across all datasets, with error rates within\nintergrader variability and superior performance relative to SAM and\nPeriorbitAI. In classification tasks, models trained on periorbital distances\nmatched CNN performance on ID data (77--78\\% accuracy) and substantially\noutperformed CNNs under OOD conditions (63--68\\% accuracy vs. 14\\%). Fusion\nmodels achieved the highest ID accuracy (80\\%) but were sensitive to degraded\nCNN features under OOD shifts.

    "abstract": "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies\nthat solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in\nrobotic manipulation. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires\novercoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of\ndrift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent\nout-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem\nthrough scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a\nhuman-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning\na dynamical system model with convergence guarantees. In this work, we propose\nand validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by\nreservoir computing, we develop a recurrent neural network layer that includes\na fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties for\nmodelling temporal dynamics. We validate the efficacy of our neural network\nlayer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human\nHandwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that\nincorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses\nthe issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative\nevaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy\npredictions and an Echo State Network (ESN) implementation. We find that our\napproach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task\nwhile also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining\ncompetitive latency scores.",

As a result, it becomes challenging for a robot to\nefficiently navigate to a specific instance. To tackle this challenge, the\nrobot must capture and update scene changes and plans continuously. However,\ncurrent object navigation approaches primarily focus on semantic-level and lack\nthe ability to dynamically update scene representation. This paper captures the\nrelationships between frequently used objects and their static carriers. It\nconstructs an open-vocabulary Carrier-Relationship Scene Graph (CRSG) and\nupdates the carrying status during robot navigation to reflect the dynamic\nchanges of the scene. Based on the CRSG, we further propose an instance\nnavigation strategy that models the navigation process as a Markov Decision\nProcess. At each step, decisions are informed by Large Language Model's\ncommonsense knowledge and visual-language feature similarity. We designed a\nseries of long-sequence navigation tasks for frequently used everyday items in\nthe Habitat simulator.

According to the characteristics of\nneural networks with common and individual model parameters, this paper designs\nthe cross-source-domain and cross-task semantic component model. Considering\nthat the basic model is deployed on the edge node, the large server node\nupdates the edge node by transmitting only the semantic component model to the\nedge node so that the edge node can handle different sources and different\ntasks. In addition, this paper also discusses how channel noise affects the\nperformance of the model and proposes methods of injection noise and\nregularization to improve the noise resistance of the model. Experiments show\nthat SMCs use smaller model parameters to achieve cross-source, cross-task\nfunctionality while maintaining performance and improving the model's tolerance\nto noise. Finally, a component transfer-based unmanned vehicle tracking\nprototype was implemented to verify the feasibility of model components in\npractical applications.",

    "abstract": "The human brain exhibits a strong ability to spontaneously associate\ndifferent visual attributes of the same or similar visual scene, such as\nassociating sketches and graffiti with real-world visual objects, usually\nwithout supervising information. In contrast, in the field of artificial\nintelligence, controllable generation methods like ControlNet heavily rely on\nannotated training datasets such as depth maps, semantic segmentation maps, and\nposes, which limits the method's scalability. Inspired by the neural mechanisms\nthat may contribute to the brain's associative power, specifically the cortical\nmodularization and hippocampal pattern completion, here we propose a\nself-supervised controllable generation (SCG) framework. Firstly, we introduce\nan equivariant constraint to promote inter-module independence and intra-module\ncorrelation in a modular autoencoder network, thereby achieving functional\nspecialization. Subsequently, based on these specialized modules, we employ a\nself-supervised pattern completion approach for controllable generation\ntraining. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modular\nautoencoder effectively achieves functional specialization, including the\nmodular processing of color, brightness, and edge detection, and exhibits\nbrain-like features including orientation selectivity, color antagonism, and\ncenter-surround receptive fields. Through self-supervised training, associative\ngeneration capabilities spontaneously emerge in SCG, demonstrating excellent\ngeneralization ability to various tasks such as associative generation on\npainting, sketches, and ancient graffiti. Compared to the previous\nrepresentative method ControlNet, our proposed approach not only demonstrates\nsuperior robustness in more challenging high-noise scenarios but also possesses\nmore promising scalability potential due to its self-supervised manner.Codes\nare released on Github and Gitee.",

Building upon this observation, we devise a pose\nregression module aimed at learning camera motion prior, subsequently\nintegrating these prior into both correspondences and pose estimation\nprocesses.

Using data on 52,000\ndecision-makers from a large online chess platform, we investigate how their AI\nuse affects three interrelated long-term outcomes: Learning, skill gap, and\ndiversity of decision strategies. First, we show that individuals are far more\nlikely to seek AI feedback in situations in which they experienced success\nrather than failure. This AI feedback seeking strategy turns out to be\ndetrimental to learning: Feedback on successes decreases future performance,\nwhile feedback on failures increases it. Second, higher-skilled decision-makers\nseek AI feedback more often and are far more likely to seek AI feedback after a\nfailure, and benefit more from AI feedback than lower-skilled individuals. As a\nresult, access to AI feedback increases, rather than decreases, the skill gap\nbetween high- and low-skilled individuals. Finally, we leverage 42 major\nplatform updates as natural experiments to show that access to AI feedback\ncauses a decrease in intellectual diversity of the population as individuals\ntend to specialize in the same areas. Together, those results indicate that\nlearning from AI feedback is not automatic and using AI correctly seems to be a\nskill itself.

Notably, our approach achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.95 for OOD\ndetection, with a specificity of 0.95 and a sensitivity of 0.92 for implant\ncases, underscoring its efficacy. This study addresses significant gaps in the\ncurrent research landscape, such as the lack of ground truth for uncertainty\nestimation and limited empirical evaluations. Additionally, it provides a\nclinically relevant application of epistemic uncertainty estimation in an\nFDA-approved and widely used clinical solution for OAR segmentation from\nVarian, a Siemens Healthineers company, highlighting its practical benefits.",

Preference-based optimization methods, such\nas Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align\nwith human preferences.

As a result, many researchers have\nbegun exploring their potential applications in the field of public opinion\nanalysis. This study proposes a novel large-language-models-based method for\npublic opinion event heat level prediction. First, we preprocessed and\nclassified 62,836 Chinese hot event data collected between July 2022 and\nDecember 2023. Then, based on each event's online dissemination heat index, we\nused the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm to automatically cluster the events and\ncategorize them into four heat levels (ranging from low heat to very high\nheat). Next, we randomly selected 250 events from each heat level, totalling\n1,000 events, to build the evaluation dataset. During the evaluation process,\nwe employed various large language models to assess their accuracy in\npredicting event heat levels in two scenarios: without reference cases and with\nsimilar case references. The results showed that GPT-4o and DeepseekV2\nperformed the best in the latter case, achieving prediction accuracies of 41.4%\nand 41.5%, respectively. Although the overall prediction accuracy remains\nrelatively low, it is worth noting that for low-heat (Level 1) events, the\nprediction accuracies of these two models reached 73.6% and 70.4%,\nrespectively. Additionally, the prediction accuracy showed a downward trend\nfrom Level 1 to Level 4, which correlates with the uneven distribution of data\nacross the heat levels in the actual dataset. This suggests that with the more\nrobust dataset, public opinion event heat level prediction based on large\nlanguage models will have significant research potential for the future.",

    "abstract": "We present a substantial extension of our Human-Aware Task Planning\nframework, tailored for scenarios with intermittent shared execution\nexperiences and significant belief divergence between humans and robots,\nparticularly due to the uncontrollable nature of humans. Our objective is to\nbuild a robot policy that accounts for uncontrollable human behaviors, thus\nenabling the anticipation of possible advancements achieved by the robot when\nthe execution is not shared, e.g. when humans are briefly absent from the\nshared environment to complete a subtask. But, this anticipation is considered\nfrom the perspective of humans who have access to an estimated model for the\nrobot. To this end, we propose a novel planning framework and build a solver\nbased on AND-OR search, which integrates knowledge reasoning, including\nsituation assessment by perspective taking. Our approach dynamically models and\nmanages the expansion and contraction of potential advances while precisely\nkeeping track of when (and when not) agents share the task execution\nexperience. The planner systematically assesses the situation and ignores\nworlds that it has reason to think are impossible for humans. Overall, our new\nsolver can estimate the distinct beliefs of the human and the robot along\npotential courses of action, enabling the synthesis of plans where the robot\nselects the right moment for communication, i.e. informing, or replying to an\ninquiry, or defers ontic actions until the execution experiences can be shared.\nPreliminary experiments in two domains, one novel and one adapted, demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the framework.",

We objectively evaluated\nthe quality of our generated sounds using the Fr\\'echet Audio Distance (FAD)\nscore and other metrics, demonstrating that our approach surpasses existing\nmodels in generating reliable machine audio that closely resembles actual\nabnormal conditions. The evaluation of the anomaly detection system using our\ngenerated data revealed a strong correlation, with the area under the curve\n(AUC) score differing by 4.8\\% from the original, validating the effectiveness\nof our generated data.

Such automatic instruction collection\npipelines, however, inadvertently introduce significant variability in data\nquality. This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived\nfrom two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress\nthis vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and\nhigh-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a\nmachine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a\ncomprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data\nquality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model\nwas trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human\nunderstanding of instruction alignment. (ii) For LLM preference alignment,\ngiven the instruction selected by the reward model, we propose leveraging the\ninner LLM used in MLLM to align the writing style of visual instructions with\nthat of the inner LLM itself, resulting in LLM-aligned instruction improvement.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that we can maintain or even improve model\nperformance by compressing synthetic multimodal instructions by up to 90%.\nImpressively, by aggressively reducing the training instructions from 158k to\n14k (9$\\times$ smaller), our model consistently outperforms its full-size\ndataset counterpart across various MLLM benchmarks.

Despite its potential,\nstandard FL lacks support for diverse heterogeneous device prototypes, which\nvary significantly in model and dataset sizes -- from small IoT devices to\nlarge workstations. This limitation is only partially addressed by existing\nknowledge distillation techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge\neffectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied\ncapabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of\ninformative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones,\nand the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all\ndevices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique\ncontributions of each. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel\nKD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device\nprototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to\npreserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a\nKD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the\nnoisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process. To integrate the\nseparately distilled knowledge, we introduce an adaptive task arithmetic\nknowledge integration process, allowing each student model to customize the\nknowledge integration for optimal performance. Additionally, we present\ntheoretical results demonstrating the effectiveness of task arithmetic in\ntransferring knowledge across heterogeneous devices with varying capacities.\nComprehensive evaluations of our method across both CV and NLP tasks\ndemonstrate that TAKFL achieves SOTA results in a variety of datasets and\nsettings, significantly outperforming existing KD-based methods Code is\nreleased at https://github.com/MMorafah/TAKFL",

Manual ASD diagnosis testing is labor-intensive, complex, and prone to\nhuman error due to several factors contaminating the results. This paper\nproposes a novel framework that exploits the laws of physics for ASD severity\nrecognition. The proposed physics-informed neural network architecture encodes\nthe behaviour of the subject extracted by observing a part of the\nskeleton-based motion trajectory in a higher dimensional latent space. Two\ndecoders, namely physics-based and non-physics-based decoder, use this latent\nembedding and predict the future motion patterns. The physics branch leverages\nthe laws of physics that apply to a skeleton sequence in the prediction process\nwhile the non-physics-based branch is optimised to minimise the difference\nbetween the predicted and actual motion of the subject. A classifier also\nleverages the same latent space embeddings to recognise the ASD severity. This\ndual generative objective explicitly forces the network to compare the actual\nbehaviour of the subject with the general normal behaviour of children that are\ngoverned by the laws of physics, aiding the ASD recognition task. The proposed\nmethod attains state-of-the-art performance on multiple ASD diagnosis\nbenchmarks.

    "abstract": "Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a\nwide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health.\nHowever, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on\nvehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains\nunder-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine\nlearning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex\npatterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of\nthese models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable\nalternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on\ndeveloping a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to\ndetect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative\nFiltering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed\nto model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge,\nthereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete,\nsuch as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules.\nThe first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative\nfiltering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest.\nThe second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex\nspatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate\nour approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world\ndatasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection\napproaches.",

RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over\noutputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into\nLLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic\nutility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What\nexacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic\nrelationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs\nare still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe\ncost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data\naccumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a\nmonetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency\nof preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an\nauction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency\nof RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance.

Thus an inappropriate\nchoice of the latent dimension fails to uncover the structure of the data,\npossibly resulting in mismatch of latent representations and poor generative\nqualities. Towards addressing these problems, we propose a novel framework\ncalled the latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN) that fuses the Wasserstein\nauto-encoder and the Wasserstein GAN so that the intrinsic dimension of the\ndata manifold can be adaptively learned by a modified informative latent\ndistribution. We prove that there exist an encoder network and a generator\nnetwork in such a way that the intrinsic dimension of the learned encoding\ndistribution is equal to the dimension of the data manifold. We theoretically\nestablish that our estimated intrinsic dimension is a consistent estimate of\nthe true dimension of the data manifold. Meanwhile, we provide an upper bound\non the generalization error of LWGAN, implying that we force the synthetic data\ndistribution to be similar to the real data distribution from a population\nperspective.

    "abstract": "3D human shape reconstruction under severe occlusion due to human-object or\nhuman-human interaction is a challenging problem. Parametric models i.e.,\nSMPL(-X), which are based on the statistics across human shapes, can represent\nwhole human body shapes but are limited to minimally-clothed human shapes.\nImplicit-function-based methods extract features from the parametric models to\nemploy prior knowledge of human bodies and can capture geometric details such\nas clothing and hair. However, they often struggle to handle misaligned\nparametric models and inpaint occluded regions given a single RGB image. In\nthis work, we propose a novel pipeline, MHCDIFF, Multi-hypotheses Conditioned\nPoint Cloud Diffusion, composed of point cloud diffusion conditioned on\nprobabilistic distributions for pixel-aligned detailed 3D human reconstruction\nunder occlusion. Compared to previous implicit-function-based methods, the\npoint cloud diffusion model can capture the global consistent features to\ngenerate the occluded regions, and the denoising process corrects the\nmisaligned SMPL meshes. The core of MHCDIFF is extracting local features from\nmultiple hypothesized SMPL(-X) meshes and aggregating the set of features to\ncondition the diffusion model. In the experiments on CAPE and MultiHuman\ndatasets, the proposed method outperforms various SOTA methods based on SMPL,\nimplicit functions, point cloud diffusion, and their combined, under synthetic\nand real occlusions.

However, using a single fixed strategy to answer\ndifferent kinds of questions is suboptimal in performance and inefficient in\nterms of generated output tokens and performed retrievals. In our work, we\npropose a novel technique DyPlan, to induce a dynamic strategy selection\nprocess in LLMs, to improve performance and reduce costs in question-answering.\nDyPlan incorporates an initial decision step to select the most suitable\nstrategy conditioned on the input question and guides the LLM's response\ngeneration accordingly. We extend DyPlan to DyPlan-verify, adding an internal\nverification and correction process to further enrich the generated answer.\nExperiments on three prominent multi-hop question answering (MHQA) datasets\nreveal how DyPlan can improve model performance by 7-13% while reducing the\ncost by 11-32% relative to the best baseline model.",

The\nBelief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that\nconventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent\nfashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures\nall relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical\nablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult\nscenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing\nwith known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the\nFill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved\nperformance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State\nTransformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time\ninference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.\nWebsite: https://sites.google.com/view/belief-state-transformer",

When robustness audits are limited to a set of\npre-determined imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily)\ntransferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more\ncomplex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative\nrobustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN\nsensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex\ndistortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions\nabout the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through\nextensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision\ntasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each\nfactor on DNN performance using observational domain data.

We introduce a method to craft an adversarial attack\nagainst the overall multi-model system when we only have a proxy model for the\nfinal black-box model, and when the transformation applied by the initial\nmodels can make the adversarial perturbations ineffective. Current methods\nhandle this by applying many copies of the first model/transformation to an\ninput and then re-use a standard adversarial attack by averaging gradients, or\nlearning a proxy model for both stages. To our knowledge, this is the first\nattack specifically designed for this threat model and our method has a\nsubstantially higher attack success rate (80% vs 25%) and contains 9.4% smaller\nperturbations (MSE) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of large language models across various\ntasks, they often struggle with reasoning under negated statements. Negations\nare important in real-world applications as they encode negative polarity in\nverb phrases, clauses, or other expressions. Nevertheless, they are\nunderrepresented in current benchmarks, which mainly include basic negation\nforms and overlook more complex ones, resulting in insufficient data for\ntraining a language model. In this work, we propose NegVerse, a method that\ntackles the lack of negation datasets by producing a diverse range of negation\ntypes from affirmative sentences, including verbal, non-verbal, and affixal\nforms commonly found in English text. We provide new rules for masking parts of\nsentences where negations are most likely to occur, based on syntactic\nstructure and use a frozen baseline LLM and prompt tuning to generate negated\nsentences. We also propose a filtering mechanism to identify negation cues and\nremove degenerate examples, producing a diverse range of meaningful\nperturbations. Our results show that NegVerse outperforms existing methods and\ngenerates negations with higher lexical similarity to the original sentences,\nbetter syntactic preservation and negation diversity.

Our approach centers on return-conditioned supervised\nlearning (RCSL), particularly focusing on the decision transformer (DT), which\ncan predict actions conditioned on desired return guidance and complete\ntrajectory history. Previous works tackle the dynamics shift problem by\naugmenting the reward in the trajectory from the source domain to match the\noptimal trajectory in the target domain. However, this strategy can not be\ndirectly applicable in RCSL owing to (1) the unique form of the RCSL policy\nclass, which explicitly depends on the return, and (2) the absence of a\nstraightforward representation of the optimal trajectory distribution. We\npropose the Return Augmented Decision Transformer (RADT) method, where we\naugment the return in the source domain by aligning its distribution with that\nin the target domain. We provide the theoretical analysis demonstrating that\nthe RCSL policy learned from RADT achieves the same level of suboptimality as\nwould be obtained without a dynamics shift.

However, recent work has found that\nmoderators disagree with one another at modest, but concerning rates. The\nproblem is not the root disagreements themselves. Subjectivity in moderation is\nunavoidable, and there are clear benefits to including diverse perspectives\nwithin a moderation team. Instead, the crux of the issue is that, due to\nresource constraints, moderation decisions end up being made by individual\ndecision-makers. The result is decision-making that is inconsistent, which is\nfrustrating for community members. To address this, we develop Venire, an\nML-backed system for panel review on Reddit. Venire uses a machine learning\nmodel trained on log data to identify the cases where moderators are most\nlikely to disagree. Venire fast-tracks these cases for multi-person review.\nIdeally, Venire allows moderators to surface and resolve disagreements that\nwould have otherwise gone unnoticed. We conduct three studies through which we\ndesign and evaluate Venire: a set of formative interviews with moderators,\ntechnical evaluations on two datasets, and a think-aloud study in which\nmoderators used Venire to make decisions on real moderation cases.\nQuantitatively, we demonstrate that Venire is able to improve decision\nconsistency and surface latent disagreements. Qualitatively, we find that\nVenire helps moderators resolve difficult moderation cases more confidently.\nVenire represents a novel paradigm for human-AI content moderation, and shifts\nthe conversation from replacing human decision-making to supporting it.",

    "abstract": "Effective governance and steering of behavior in complex multi-agent systems\n(MAS) are essential for managing system-wide outcomes, particularly in\nenvironments where interactions are structured by dynamic networks. In many\napplications, the goal is to promote pro-social behavior among agents, where\nnetwork structure plays a pivotal role in shaping these interactions. This\npaper introduces a Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning (HGRL) framework\nthat governs such systems through targeted interventions in the network\nstructure. Operating within the constraints of limited managerial authority,\nthe HGRL framework demonstrates superior performance across a range of\nenvironmental conditions, outperforming established baseline methods. Our\nfindings highlight the critical influence of agent-to-agent learning (social\nlearning) on system behavior: under low social learning, the HGRL manager\npreserves cooperation, forming robust core-periphery networks dominated by\ncooperators. In contrast, high social learning accelerates defection, leading\nto sparser, chain-like networks. Additionally, the study underscores the\nimportance of the system manager's authority level in preventing system-wide\nfailures, such as agent rebellion or collapse, positioning HGRL as a powerful\ntool for dynamic network-based governance.",

Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with\nits ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG\npractice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful\nsupervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with\ntemporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals\ninspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal\nand spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with\nfrequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance\nmetrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning\nfrom spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our\nhandling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse\nengineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of\nIEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also\nshowed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical\npatients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work\nis needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients.

    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion models, while achieving minimax optimality for\nsampling, are often hampered by slow sampling speeds due to the high\ncomputational burden of score function evaluations. Despite the recent\nremarkable empirical advances in speeding up the score-based samplers,\ntheoretical understanding of acceleration techniques remains largely limited.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose a novel training-free acceleration scheme for\nstochastic samplers. Under minimal assumptions -- namely, $L^2$-accurate score\nestimates and a finite second-moment condition on the target distribution --\nour accelerated sampler provably achieves $\\varepsilon$-accuracy in total\nvariation within $\\widetilde{O}(d^{5/4}/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ iterations,\nthereby significantly improving upon the $\\widetilde{O}(d/\\varepsilon)$\niteration complexity of standard score-based samplers for $\\varepsilon\\leq\n1/\\sqrt{d}$. Notably, our convergence theory does not rely on restrictive\nassumptions on the target distribution or higher-order score estimation\nguarantees.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on the efficiency of the knowledge distillation approach in\ngenerating a lightweight yet powerful BERT based model for natural language\nprocessing applications. After the model creation, we applied the resulting\nmodel, LastBERT, to a real-world task classifying severity levels of Attention\nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-related concerns from social media text\ndata. Referring to LastBERT, a customized student BERT model, we significantly\nlowered model parameters from 110 million BERT base to 29 million, resulting in\na model approximately 73.64% smaller. On the GLUE benchmark, comprising\nparaphrase identification, sentiment analysis, and text classification, the\nstudent model maintained strong performance across many tasks despite this\nreduction. The model was also used on a real-world ADHD dataset with an\naccuracy and F1 score of 85%. When compared to DistilBERT (66M) and\nClinicalBERT (110M), LastBERT demonstrated comparable performance, with\nDistilBERT slightly outperforming it at 87%, and ClinicalBERT achieving 86%\nacross the same metrics. These findings highlight the LastBERT model's capacity\nto classify degrees of ADHD severity properly, so it offers a useful tool for\nmental health professionals to assess and comprehend material produced by users\non social networking platforms. The study emphasizes the possibilities of\nknowledge distillation to produce effective models fit for use in\nresource-limited conditions, hence advancing NLP and mental health diagnosis.\nFurthermore underlined by the considerable decrease in model size without\nappreciable performance loss is the lower computational resources needed for\ntraining and deployment, hence facilitating greater applicability.

    "abstract": "Human beings are endowed with a complementary learning system, which bridges\nthe slow learning of general world dynamics with fast storage of episodic\nmemory from a new experience. Previous video generation models, however,\nprimarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data,\noverlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage. This\noversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when\ngenerating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context\nwindow. To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning\nsystem for action-driven long video generation. Our approach incorporates a\nmasked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world\ndynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a\ntemporal LoRA module. Specifically, the fast learning process updates its\ntemporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently\nstoring episodic memory in its parameters. We further propose a slow-fast\nlearning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop\ninto the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode\nexperiences for context-aware skill learning. To facilitate the slow learning\nof an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos\nwith language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various\nmetrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514\ncompared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average\nof 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models achieve high-quality sample generation at the cost of a\nlengthy multistep inference procedure. To overcome this, diffusion distillation\ntechniques produce student generators capable of matching or surpassing the\nteacher in a single step. However, the student model's inference speed is\nlimited by the size of the teacher architecture, preventing real-time\ngeneration for computationally heavy applications. In this work, we introduce\nMulti-Student Distillation (MSD), a framework to distill a conditional teacher\ndiffusion model into multiple single-step generators. Each student generator is\nresponsible for a subset of the conditioning data, thereby obtaining higher\ngeneration quality for the same capacity. MSD trains multiple distilled\nstudents, allowing smaller sizes and, therefore, faster inference. Also, MSD\noffers a lightweight quality boost over single-student distillation with the\nsame architecture. We demonstrate MSD is effective by training multiple\nsame-sized or smaller students on single-step distillation using distribution\nmatching and adversarial distillation techniques. With smaller students, MSD\ngets competitive results with faster inference for single-step generation.\nUsing 4 same-sized students, MSD significantly outperforms single-student\nbaseline counterparts and achieves remarkable FID scores for one-step image\ngeneration: 1.20 on ImageNet-64x64 and 8.20 on zero-shot COCO2014.",

We expand the\nframework to non-centroid clustering, where the loss of an agent is a function\nof the other agents in its cluster, by adapting two proportional fairness\ncriteria -- the core and its relaxation, fully justified representation (FJR)\n-- to this setting.\n  We show that the core can be approximated only under structured loss\nfunctions, and even then, the best approximation we are able to establish,\nusing an adaptation of the GreedyCapture algorithm developed for centroid\nclustering [Chen et al., 2019; Micha and Shah, 2020], is unappealing for a\nnatural loss function. In contrast, we design a new (inefficient) algorithm,\nGreedyCohesiveClustering, which achieves the relaxation FJR exactly under\narbitrary loss functions, and show that the efficient GreedyCapture algorithm\nachieves a constant approximation of FJR. We also design an efficient auditing\nalgorithm, which estimates the FJR approximation of any given clustering\nsolution up to a constant factor.

However, how well do the models truly perform\nvisual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this\ncapability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by\nusing a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current\nvisual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding\nmetrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame\nInformation Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO,\nTemporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to\nrigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding.\nTOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning\nsix tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity &\nfrequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805\nself-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world,\nand simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model\nperformance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth\nanalysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs.\nWhile they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to\ninterpret these frames as a continuous sequence.

In a question-and-answer capacity,\nunderstanding the interactions of physical objects may be necessary to give\nappropriate responses. Moreover, LLMs are increasingly used as reasoning\nengines in agentic systems, designing and controlling their action sequences.\nThe vast majority of research has tackled this issue using static benchmarks,\ncomprised of text or image-based questions about the physical world. However,\nthese benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical\nprocesses. Here we advocate for a second, relatively unexplored, approach:\n'embodying' the LLMs by granting them control of an agent within a 3D\nenvironment. We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful\nevaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows\ndirect comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on\nDeep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the\nAnimal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study\nphysical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a\nsuite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals,\nto study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation,\ntracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use. We demonstrate that\nstate-of-the-art multi-modal models with no finetuning can complete this style\nof task, allowing meaningful comparison to the entrants of the 2019 Animal-AI\nOlympics competition and to human children. Our results show that LLMs are\ncurrently outperformed by human children on these tasks.

Despite the advancements in robotic behaviors, existing methods\noften fall short in mimicking the diversity and subtlety of human non-verbal\ncommunication.

We\nuse this framework to generate 10 different expressive gestures and conduct\nonline user studies comparing the naturalness and understandability of the\nmotions generated by EMOTION and its human-feedback version, EMOTION++, against\nthose by human operators. The results demonstrate that our approach either\nmatches or surpasses human performance in generating understandable and natural\nrobot motions under certain scenarios.

    "abstract": "Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint\nrepresentation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies\ndevelop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV\ndata alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation.\nWe observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference.\nAlso, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These\nnon-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade\napplication performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint\nrepresentations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to\nvisual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an\nLLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent\nuses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language\ndescriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this\npaired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e.,\nplanning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter\nnoise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio\nsignals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e.,\nreflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to\nbecome an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual\ncontent. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV\ndata via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The\nexperimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art\nperformance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse\ndownstream tasks.",

To achieve robust\nalignment with general preferences, we model the alignment problem as a\ntwo-player zero-sum game, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50%\nwin rate against any competing policy. However, previous algorithms for finding\nthe Nash policy either diverge or converge to a Nash policy in a modified game,\neven in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win\nrate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm,\nConvergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with\ngeneral preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory.\nTheoretically, we prove that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash\npolicy in the last iterate. Additionally, our meta-algorithm is simple and can\nbe integrated with many existing methods designed for RLHF and preference\noptimization with minimal changes.

However, previous efforts have primarily focused on designing model\narchitectures to address explicit heterogeneity among datasets such as various\nnumbers of channels, while often overlooking implicit heterogeneity such as\nvarying dependencies between channels. In this work, we introduce the concept\nof partial channel dependence (PCD), which enables a more sophisticated\nadjustment of channel dependencies based on dataset-specific information. To\nachieve PCD, we propose a channel mask that captures the relationships between\nchannels within a dataset using two key components: 1) a correlation matrix\nthat encodes relative dependencies between channels, and 2) domain parameters\nthat learn the absolute dependencies specific to each dataset, refining the\ncorrelation matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across four tasks in\nTS including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection,\nunder diverse settings, including few-shot and zero-shot scenarios with both TS\nfoundation models and single-task models.

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of digital technologies has produced data-driven feedback\nloops, wearable devices, social media networks, and mobile applications that\nshape user behavior, motivation, and mental well-being. While these systems\nencourage self-improvement and the development of healthier habits through\nreal-time feedback, they also create psychological risks such as technostress,\naddiction, and loss of autonomy. The present study also aims to investigate the\npositive and negative psychological consequences of feedback mechanisms on\nusers' behaviour and well-being. Employing a descriptive survey method, the\nstudy collected data from 200 purposely selected users to assess changes in\nbehaviour, motivation, and mental well-being related to health, social, and\nlifestyle applications. Results indicate that while feedback mechanisms\nfacilitate goal attainment and social interconnection through streaks and\nbadges, among other components, they also enhance anxiety, mental weariness,\nand loss of productivity due to actions that are considered feedback-seeking.\nFurthermore, test subjects reported that their actions are unconsciously shaped\nby app feedback, often at the expense of personal autonomy, while real-time\nfeedback minimally influences professional or social interactions. The study\nshows that data-driven feedback loops deliver not only motivational benefits\nbut also psychological challenges. To mitigate these risks, users should\nestablish boundaries regarding their use of technology to prevent burnout and\naddiction, while developers need to refine feedback mechanisms to reduce\ncognitive load and foster more inclusive participation. Future research should\nfocus on designing feedback mechanisms that promote well-being without\ncompromising individual freedom or increasing social comparison.",

The\ntwo loss terms work together to replace the traditional $L_2$ losses such as\nMSE and weighted MSE for the spatiotemporal prediction problem on signal-based\ndata. Our method is generic, parameter-free and efficient. Extensive\nexperiments using one synthetic dataset and three radar echo datasets\ndemonstrate that our method improves perceptual metrics and meteorology skill\nscores, with a small trade-off to pixel-wise accuracy and structural\nsimilarity. Moreover, to improve the error margin in meteorological skill\nscores such as Critical Success Index (CSI) and Fractions Skill Score (FSS), we\npropose and adopt the Regional Histogram Divergence (RHD), a distance metric\nthat considers the patch-wise similarity between signal-based imagery patterns\nwith tolerance to local transforms.

Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are\nconstrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the\npotential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation\nhallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, in this paper we\ndesign a unified framework to measure object and relation hallucination in\nLVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to conduct\nhallucination evaluation on (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from\nLVLMs' responses, and thus, could be easily generalized to different\nvision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a\nnovel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to\nstudy both object and relation hallucination at the same time. We conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE and observe that the relation hallucination\nissue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs,\nhighlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover,\nbased on our findings, we design a simple yet effective training-free approach\nto mitigate hallucinations for LVLMs, with which, we exceed all open-sourced\ncounterparts on Tri-HE, achieving comparable performance with the powerful\nGPT-4V.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision\ndata. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their\nperformance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data\nthat cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a\npromising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing.\nHowever, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL,\nparticularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In\nthis paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of\npopular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to\nconstrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders\neffective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous\nanalytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight\naveraging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance\nfor fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison unmasks inefficiencies in\nLoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We\nextend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used\nduring local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore along with\ndirect-weight aggregation is a more effective approach, outperforming federated\nLoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities.\nWhile privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing\nperformance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL\nframeworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings\nadvocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way\nfor more efficient training methodologies.",

Despite the overwhelming success of deep\nlearning methods key questions about their internal workings still remain\nlargely unanswered, due to their internal high dimensionality and complexity.\nTo address this, one approach is to measure the similarity of activation\nresponses to various inputs. Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs)\ndistill this similarity into scalar values for each input pair. These matrices\nencapsulate the entire similarity structure of a system, indicating which input\nleads to similar responses. While the similarity between images is ambiguous,\nwe argue that the spatial location of semantic objects does neither influence\nhuman perception nor deep learning classifiers. Thus this should be reflected\nin the definition of similarity between image responses for computer vision\nsystems. Revisiting the established similarity calculations for RSMs we expose\ntheir sensitivity to spatial alignment. In this paper, we propose to solve this\nthrough semantic RSMs, which are invariant to spatial permutation. We measure\nsemantic similarity between input responses by formulating it as a set-matching\nproblem. Further, we quantify the superiority of semantic RSMs over\nspatio-semantic RSMs through image retrieval and by comparing the similarity\nbetween representations to the similarity between predicted class\nprobabilities.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning can help Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt new tasks\nwithout additional training. However, this performance heavily depends on the\nquality of the demonstrations, driving research into effective demonstration\nselection algorithms to optimize this process. These algorithms assist users in\nselecting the best $k$ input-label pairs (demonstration examples) based on a\ngiven test input, enabling LLMs to in-context learn the relationship between\nthe provided examples and the test inputs. Despite all the proposed\ndemonstration selection algorithms, their efficiency and effectiveness remain\nunclear. This lack of clarity make it difficult to apply these algorithms in\nreal-world scenarios and poses challenges for future research aimed at\ndeveloping improved methods. This paper revisits six proposed algorithms,\nevaluating them on five datasets from both efficiency and effectiveness\nperspectives. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithm\nperformance across different tasks, with some methods struggling to outperform\nrandom selection in certain scenarios. We also find that increasing the number\nof demonstrations does not always lead to better performance, and that there\nare often trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Investment Analysis is a cornerstone of the Financial Services industry. The\nrapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating\nprocess. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon\nstock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods\nrely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several\nchallenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed\nreactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs\nto improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we\nassess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the\nfinancial domain.\n  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news\ndata from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a\ntraining cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show\nthat our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when\nassessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial\nfundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance,\nsubstituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use\nwithout loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely\nenhances performance by reducing bias.\n  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large\namounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at\nthe stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and\nefficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a\ncost-effective alternative to traditional methods. Future work will extend to\nlonger timeframes, incorporate diverse data, and utilize newer models for\nenhanced insights.",

Most existing\nmethods for generating saliency maps rely on ground truth labels, restricting\ntheir use to supervised tasks. EigenCAM is the only notable label-independent\nalternative, leveraging Singular Value Decomposition to generate saliency maps\napplicable across CNN models, but it does not fully exploit the tensorial\nstructure of feature maps. In this work, we introduce the Tucker Saliency Map\n(TSM) method, which applies Tucker tensor decomposition to better capture the\ninherent structure of feature maps, producing more accurate singular vectors\nand values. These are used to generate high-fidelity saliency maps, effectively\nhighlighting objects of interest in the input. We further extend EigenCAM and\nTSM into multivector variants -Multivec-EigenCAM and Multivector Tucker\nSaliency Maps (MTSM)- which utilize all singular vectors and values, further\nimproving saliency map quality. Quantitative evaluations on supervised\nclassification models demonstrate that TSM, Multivec-EigenCAM, and MTSM achieve\ncompetitive performance with label-dependent methods. Moreover, TSM enhances\nexplainability by approximately 50% over EigenCAM for both supervised and\nself-supervised models.

Most existing studies retrieve related\ninformation based on the semantic similarity of memory to maintain characters'\npersonalized traits, and few attempts have been made to incorporate the\nemotional factor in the retrieval argument generation (RAG) of LLMs. Inspired\nby the Mood-Dependent Memory theory, which indicates that people recall an\nevent better if they somehow reinstate during recall the original emotion they\nexperienced during learning, we propose a novel emotion-aware memory retrieval\nframework, termed Emotional RAG, which recalls the related memory with\nconsideration of emotional state in role-playing agents. Specifically, we\ndesign two kinds of retrieval strategies, i.e., combination strategy and\nsequential strategy, to incorporate both memory semantic and emotional states\nduring the retrieval process.

By analyzing these\nrelationships, we can gain insights into how different design features impact\nlaser performance properties such as the working temperature. Most of these QCL\nproperties are captured in scientific text. There is therefore need for\nefficient methodologies that can be utilized to extract QCL properties from\ntext and generate a semantically enriched and interlinked platform where the\nproperties can be analyzed to uncover hidden relations. There is also the need\nto maintain provenance and reference information on which these properties are\nbased.

The approach is based on the QCL ontology and a\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enabled information extraction pipeline\nbased on GPT 4-Turbo language model. The properties of interest include:\nworking temperature, laser design type, lasing frequency, laser optical power\nand the heterostructure.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate that these dynamic approaches can significantly improve latency and\nthroughput without compromising quality. When combined with model-based\noptimizations, such as quantization, dynamic execution provides a powerful\nmulti-pronged strategy to optimize AI inference.\n  Generative AI requires a large amount of compute resources.

    "abstract": "A common strategy for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained\nVision Transformers (ViTs) involves adapting the model to downstream tasks by\nlearning a low-rank adaptation matrix. This matrix is decomposed into a product\nof down-projection and up-projection matrices, with the bottleneck\ndimensionality being crucial for reducing the number of learnable parameters,\nas exemplified by prevalent methods like LoRA and Adapter. However, these\nlow-rank strategies typically employ a fixed bottleneck dimensionality, which\nlimits their flexibility in handling layer-wise variations. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel PEFT approach inspired by Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) for representing the adaptation matrix. SVD decomposes a\nmatrix into the product of a left unitary matrix, a diagonal matrix of scaling\nvalues, and a right unitary matrix. We utilize Householder transformations to\nconstruct orthogonal matrices that efficiently mimic the unitary matrices,\nrequiring only a vector. The diagonal values are learned in a layer-wise\nmanner, allowing them to flexibly capture the unique properties of each layer.\nThis approach enables the generation of adaptation matrices with varying ranks\nacross different layers, providing greater flexibility in adapting pre-trained\nmodels. Experiments on standard downstream vision tasks demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves promising fine-tuning performance.",

To address these challenges, we propose the Energy\nForecasting Large Language Model (EF-LLM), which integrates domain knowledge\nand temporal data for time-series forecasting, supporting both pre-forecast\noperations and post-forecast decision-support. EF-LLM's human-AI interaction\ncapabilities lower the entry barrier in forecasting tasks, reducing the need\nfor extra expert involvement. To achieve this, we propose a continual learning\napproach with updatable LoRA and a multi-channel architecture for aligning\nheterogeneous multimodal data, enabling EF-LLM to continually learn\nheterogeneous multimodal knowledge. In addition, EF-LLM enables accurate\npredictions under sparse data conditions through its ability to process\nmultimodal data. We propose Fusion Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (F-PEFT)\nmethod to effectively leverage both time-series data and text for this purpose.\nEF-LLM is also the first energy-specific LLM to detect hallucinations and\nquantify their occurrence rate, achieved via multi-task learning, semantic\nsimilarity analysis, and ANOVA. We have achieved success in energy prediction\nscenarios for load, photovoltaic, and wind power forecast.",

GWQ\nretains the top 1\\% outliers preferentially at FP16 precision, while the\nremaining non-outlier weights are stored in a low-bit. We widely evaluate GWQ\non different task include language modeling, grounding detection, massive\nmultitask language understanding and vision-language question and answering.\nResults show that models quantified by GWQ performs better than other\nquantization method.

By iterating over sentence pairs in a\npreference dataset, DPO enhances generation quality by increasing the\nlikelihood of producing preferred sentences over less favored ones. Preference\ndatasets are typically created by selecting preferred sentences through a\nvoting process involving multiple individuals, as opinions can vary due to the\nsubjective nature of human preferences. While the number of votes offers\ninsight into whether a sentence pair is clearly preferable or controversial,\ncurrent methods do not fully leverage this information.

We employ the Bayesian Minimum Mean Square\nError (Bayesian MMSE) estimator to model the probability that one generation is\npreferable to another. Using this estimated probability as a target, we develop\nthe Vote-based Preference Optimization (VPO) framework, which incorporates the\nnumber of votes on both sides to distinguish between controversial and obvious\ngeneration pairs.

However, when applied to\nreal-world datasets with long-tailed distributions, performance on multiple\ndownstream tasks degrades significantly. Recently, the community has begun to\nfocus more on self-supervised long-tailed learning. Some works attempt to\ntransfer temperature mechanisms to self-supervised learning or use\ncategory-space uniformity constraints to balance the representation of\ndifferent categories in the embedding space to fight against long-tail\ndistributions. However, most of these approaches focus on the joint\noptimization of all samples in the dataset or on constraining the category\ndistribution, with little attention given to whether each individual sample is\noptimally guided during training.

We introduce pseudo-labels into\nself-supervised long-tailed learning, utilizing pseudo-label information to\ndrive a dynamic temperature and re-weighting strategy. Specifically, We assign\nan optimal temperature parameter to each sample. Additionally, we analyze the\nlack of quantity awareness in the temperature parameter and use re-weighting to\ncompensate for this deficiency, thereby achieving optimal training patterns at\nthe sample level.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the attack is\ntransferable across different retriever models, underscoring the widespread\nrisk it poses to RAG systems. Lastly, our exploration of various defense\nmechanisms reveals that they are insufficient to counter HijackRAG, emphasizing\nthe urgent need for more robust security measures to protect RAG systems in\nreal-world deployments.",

    "abstract": "When individuals encounter observations that violate their expectations, when\nwill they adjust their expectations and when will they maintain them despite\nthese observations? For example, when individuals expect objects of type A to\nbe smaller than objects B, but observe the opposite, when will they adjust\ntheir expectation about the relationship between the two objects (to A being\nlarger than B)? Naively, one would predict that the larger the violation, the\ngreater the adaptation. However, experiments reveal that when violations are\nextreme, individuals are more likely to hold on to their prior expectations\nrather than adjust them. To address this puzzle, we tested the adaptation of\nartificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning and found a\nsimilar phenomenon: Standard learning dynamics dictates that small violations\nwould lead to adjustments of expected relations while larger ones would be\nresolved using a different mechanism -- a change in object representation that\nbypasses the need for adaptation of the relational expectations. These results\nsuggest that the experimentally-observed stability of prior expectations when\nfacing large expectation violations is a natural consequence of learning\ndynamics and does not require any additional mechanisms. We conclude by\ndiscussing the effect of intermediate adaptation steps on this stability.",

    "abstract": "Researchers in empirical machine learning recently spotlighted their fears of\nso-called Model Collapse. They imagined a discard workflow, where an initial\ngenerative model is trained with real data, after which the real data are\ndiscarded, and subsequently, the model generates synthetic data on which a new\nmodel is trained. They came to the conclusion that models degenerate as\nmodel-fitting generations proceed. However, other researchers considered an\naugment workflow, where the original real data continue to be used in each\ngeneration of training, augmented by synthetic data from models fit in all\nearlier generations. Empirical results on canonical datasets and learning\nprocedures confirmed the occurrence of model collapse under the discard\nworkflow and avoidance of model collapse under the augment workflow. Under the\naugment workflow, theoretical evidence also confirmed avoidance in particular\ninstances; specifically, Gerstgrasser et al. (2024) found that for classical\nLinear Regression, test risk at any later generation is bounded by a moderate\nmultiple, viz. pi-squared-over-6 of the test risk of training with the original\nreal data alone. Some commentators questioned the generality of theoretical\nconclusions based on the generative model assumed in Gerstgrasser et al.\n(2024): could similar conclusions be reached for other task/model pairings? In\nthis work, we demonstrate the universality of the pi-squared-over-6 augment\nrisk bound across a large family of canonical statistical models, offering key\ninsights into exactly why collapse happens under the discard workflow and is\navoided under the augment workflow. In the process, we provide a framework that\nis able to accommodate a large variety of workflows (beyond discard and\naugment), thereby enabling an experimenter to judge the comparative merits of\nmultiple different workflows by simulating a simple Gaussian process.",

The performance of such a supervised approach, however, is\ndrastically degraded under mismatched conditions. This calls for run-time\nadaptation of the DNN. Although the ground-truth speech spectrogram required\nfor adaptation is not available at run time, blind dereverberation and\nseparation methods such as weighted prediction error (WPE) and fast\nmultichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (FastMNMF) can be used for\ngenerating pseudo groundtruth data from a mixture.

To integrate the dereverberation capability into\nneural beamforming and make it fine-tunable at run time, we propose to use\nweighted power minimization distortionless response (WPD) beamforming, a\nunified version of WPE and minimum power distortionless response (MPDR), whose\njoint dereverberation and denoising filter is estimated using a DNN.

PPO, particularly in continuous action spaces, shows\npromising results for fine control, although challenges such as policy collapse\nremain. We compare the performance of these approaches and outline future\nresearch directions focused on improving computational efficiency and\naddressing model stability. Our findings contribute to the ongoing development\nof AI systems in autonomous driving and related control tasks.",

However, numerous benign conditions can cause increased\nuptake of radiopharmaceuticals, confounding differentiation from malignant\ntumors. Several studies have indicated that dual-time PET imaging holds promise\nin distinguishing between malignant and benign tumor processes. Nevertheless,\nthe hour-long distribution period of radiopharmaceuticals post-injection\ncomplicates the determination of optimal timing for the second scan, presenting\nchallenges in both practical applications and research. Notably, we have\nidentified that delay time PET imaging can be framed as an image-to-image\nconversion problem. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel\nspatial-temporal guided diffusion transformer probabilistic model (st-DTPM) to\nsolve dual-time PET imaging prediction problem. Specifically, this architecture\nleverages the U-net framework that integrates patch-wise features of CNN and\npixel-wise relevance of Transformer to obtain local and global information. And\nthen employs a conditional DDPM model for image synthesis. Furthermore, on\nspatial condition, we concatenate early scan PET images and noisy PET images on\nevery denoising step to guide the spatial distribution of denoising sampling.\nOn temporal condition, we convert diffusion time steps and delay time to a\nuniversal time vector, then embed it to each layer of model architecture to\nfurther improve the accuracy of predictions.

To tackle this issue, we formulate offline\nbehavior distillation (OBD), which synthesizes limited expert behavioral data\nfrom sub-optimal RL data, enabling rapid policy learning. We propose two naive\nOBD objectives, DBC and PBC, which measure distillation performance via the\ndecision difference between policies trained on distilled data and either\noffline data or a near-expert policy. Due to intractable bi-level optimization,\nthe OBD objective is difficult to minimize to small values, which deteriorates\nPBC by its distillation performance guarantee with quadratic discount\ncomplexity $\\mathcal{O}(1/(1-\\gamma)^2)$. We theoretically establish the\nequivalence between the policy performance and action-value weighted decision\ndifference, and introduce action-value weighted PBC (Av-PBC) as a more\neffective OBD objective. By optimizing the weighted decision difference, Av-PBC\nachieves a superior distillation guarantee with linear discount complexity\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/(1-\\gamma))$. Extensive experiments on multiple D4RL datasets\nreveal that Av-PBC offers significant improvements in OBD performance, fast\ndistillation convergence speed, and robust cross-architecture/optimizer\ngeneralization.",

Second, a four-channel GNNFE is designed to extract\nhigh-order and individual features from the constructed KCN. Finally, CAP\nemploys a multi-layer perceptron to fuse the extracted features to predict\nstudents' learning abilities in an end-to-end learning way.

    "abstract": "As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding\nhuman preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address\nthis, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human\nchoice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent\ncan use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of\nstates and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined\nby the partial return or the cumulative advantage.\n  We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return,\nwhich adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of\nthe bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike\npartial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs\nabout the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from\nchoices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct,\ndoing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not.\n  To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an\nAlignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of\npreferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This\nensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based\non bootstrapped return.\n  The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice\nbehavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a\nbootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds\nwith choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both\nadhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other\nhand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return\nor cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward\nfunction.",

We examine\nparticipants' self-reported LLM usage, finding that 81% of researchers have\nalready incorporated LLMs into different aspects of their research workflow. We\nalso find that traditionally disadvantaged groups in academia (non-White,\njunior, and non-native English speaking researchers) report higher LLM usage\nand perceived benefits, suggesting potential for improved research equity.\nHowever, women, non-binary, and senior researchers have greater ethical\nconcerns, potentially hindering adoption.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have outperformed traditional Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN) across various computer vision tasks. However, akin to CNN, ViTs\nare vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where the adversary embeds the backdoor\ninto the victim model, causing it to make wrong predictions about testing\nsamples containing a specific trigger. Existing backdoor attacks against ViTs\nhave the limitation of failing to strike an optimal balance between attack\nstealthiness and attack effectiveness.\n  In this work, we propose an Attention Gradient-based Erosion Backdoor (AGEB)\ntargeted at ViTs. Considering the attention mechanism of ViTs, AGEB selectively\nerodes pixels in areas of maximal attention gradient, embedding a covert\nbackdoor trigger. Unlike previous backdoor attacks against ViTs, AGEB achieves\nan optimal balance between attack stealthiness and attack effectiveness,\nensuring the trigger remains invisible to human detection while preserving the\nmodel's accuracy on clean samples. Extensive experimental evaluations across\nvarious ViT architectures and datasets confirm the effectiveness of AGEB,\nachieving a remarkable Attack Success Rate (ASR) without diminishing Clean Data\nAccuracy (CDA). Furthermore, the stealthiness of AGEB is rigorously validated,\ndemonstrating minimal visual discrepancies between the clean and the triggered\nimages.",

Current\nlarge-language-model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-based MAS) have shown\nsuccess in areas like software development and operating systems, but applying\nthese systems to robot control presents unique challenges. In particular, the\ncapabilities of each agent in a multi-robot system are inherently tied to the\nphysical composition of the robots, rather than predefined roles. To address\nthis issue, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to enable\neffective collaboration among heterogeneous robots with varying embodiments and\ncapabilities, along with a new benchmark named Habitat-MAS. One of our key\ndesigns is $\\textit{Robot Resume}$: Instead of adopting human-designed role\nplay, we propose a self-prompted approach, where agents comprehend robot URDF\nfiles and call robot kinematics tools to generate descriptions of their physics\ncapabilities to guide their behavior in task planning and action execution. The\nHabitat-MAS benchmark is designed to assess how a multi-agent framework handles\ntasks that require embodiment-aware reasoning, which includes 1) manipulation,\n2) perception, 3) navigation, and 4) comprehensive multi-floor object\nrearrangement. The experimental results indicate that the robot's resume and\nthe hierarchical design of our multi-agent system are essential for the\neffective operation of the heterogeneous multi-robot system within this\nintricate problem context.",

While these\napproaches isolate parameters for specific tasks and tend to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting, they limit knowledge sharing among different\ndemonstrations. We introduce IsCiL, an adapter-based CiL framework that\naddresses this limitation of knowledge sharing by incrementally learning\nshareable skills from different demonstrations, thus enabling sample-efficient\ntask adaptation using the skills particularly in non-stationary CiL\nenvironments. In IsCiL, demonstrations are mapped into the state embedding\nspace, where proper skills can be retrieved upon input states through\nprototype-based memory. These retrievable skills are incrementally learned on\ntheir corresponding adapters. Our CiL experiments with complex tasks in\nFranka-Kitchen and Meta-World demonstrate robust performance of IsCiL in both\ntask adaptation and sample-efficiency.

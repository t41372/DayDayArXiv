    "abstract": "Policy constraint methods in offline reinforcement learning employ additional\nregularization techniques to constrain the discrepancy between the learned\npolicy and the offline dataset. However, these methods tend to result in overly\nconservative policies that resemble the behavior policy, thus limiting their\nperformance. We investigate this limitation and attribute it to the static\nnature of traditional constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic\npolicy constraint that restricts the learned policy on the samples generated by\nthe exponential moving average of previously learned policies. By integrating\nthis self-constraint mechanism into off-policy methods, our method facilitates\nthe learning of non-conservative policies while avoiding policy collapse in the\noffline setting. Theoretical results show that our approach results in a nearly\nmonotonically improved reference policy. Extensive experiments on the D4RL\nMuJoCo domain demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among the policy constraint methods.",

    "abstract": "Calibrated recommendation, which aims to maintain personalized proportions of\ncategories within recommendations, is crucial in practical scenarios since it\nenhances user satisfaction by reflecting diverse interests. However, achieving\ncalibration in a sequential setting (i.e., calibrated sequential\nrecommendation) is challenging due to the need to adapt to users' evolving\npreferences. Previous methods typically leverage reranking algorithms to\ncalibrate recommendations after training a model without considering the effect\nof calibration and do not effectively tackle the conflict between relevance and\ncalibration during the reranking process. In this work, we propose LeapRec\n(Calibration-Disentangled Learning and Relevance-Prioritized Reranking), a\nnovel approach for the calibrated sequential recommendation that addresses\nthese challenges. LeapRec consists of two phases, model training phase and\nreranking phase. In the training phase, a backbone model is trained using our\nproposed calibration-disentangled learning-to-rank loss, which optimizes\npersonalized rankings while integrating calibration considerations. In the\nreranking phase, relevant items are prioritized at the top of the list, with\nitems needed for calibration following later to address potential conflicts\nbetween relevance and calibration. Through extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets, we show that LeapRec consistently outperforms previous\nmethods in the calibrated sequential recommendation.

Moreover, our dataset can\nbe automatically updated as OSS-Fuzz finds new vulnerabilities, allowing it to\ngrow over time. We provide a thorough characterization of the ARVO dataset,\nshow that it can locate fixes more accurately than Google's own OSV\nreproduction effort, and demonstrate its value for future research through two\ncase studies: firstly evaluating real-world LLM-based vulnerability repair, and\nsecondly identifying over 300 falsely patched (still-active) zero-day\nvulnerabilities from projects improperly labeled by OSS-Fuzz.",

To address the above\nissues, we propose a novel few-shot indexing-based GR framework (Few-Shot GR).\nIt has a novel few-shot indexing process, where we prompt an LLM to generate\ndocids for all documents in a corpus, ultimately creating a docid bank for the\nentire corpus. During retrieval, we feed a query to the same LLM and constrain\nit to generate a docid within the docid bank created during indexing, and then\nmap the generated docid back to its corresponding document. Few-Shot GR relies\nsolely on prompting an LLM without requiring any training, making it more\nefficient.

There\nis a growing interest in academia to use these models to simulate and study\nhuman behaviors. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that an LLM's\nproficiency in a specific language might not fully encapsulate the norms and\nvalues associated with its culture. Concerns have emerged regarding potential\nbiases towards Anglo-centric cultures and values due to the predominance of\nWestern and US-based training data. This study focuses on analyzing the\ncultural representations of emotions in LLMs, in the specific case of\nmixed-emotion situations. Our methodology is based on the studies of Miyamoto\net al. (2010), which identified distinctive emotional indicators in Japanese\nand American human responses. We first administer their mixed emotion survey to\nfive different LLMs and analyze their outputs. Second, we experiment with\ncontextual variables to explore variations in responses considering both\nlanguage and speaker origin. Thirdly, we expand our investigation to encompass\nadditional East Asian and Western European origin languages to gauge their\nalignment with their respective cultures, anticipating a closer fit. We find\nthat (1) models have limited alignment with the evidence in the literature; (2)\nwritten language has greater effect on LLMs' response than information on\nparticipants origin; and (3) LLMs responses were found more similar for East\nAsian languages than Western European languages.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous parking is a crucial task in the intelligent driving field.\nTraditional parking algorithms are usually implemented using rule-based\nschemes. However, these methods are less effective in complex parking scenarios\ndue to the intricate design of the algorithms. In contrast,\nneural-network-based methods tend to be more intuitive and versatile than the\nrule-based methods. By collecting a large number of expert parking trajectory\ndata and emulating human strategy via learning-based methods, the parking task\ncan be effectively addressed. In this paper, we employ imitation learning to\nperform end-to-end planning from RGB images to path planning by imitating human\ndriving trajectories. The proposed end-to-end approach utilizes a target query\nencoder to fuse images and target features, and a transformer-based decoder to\nautoregressively predict future waypoints. We conducted extensive experiments\nin real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieved an average parking success rate of 87.8% across four different\nreal-world garages. Real-vehicle experiments further validate the feasibility\nand effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.",

In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D SOT in point\nclouds with high temporal variation, called HVTrack.

    "abstract": "The field of neuromorphic computing has gained significant attention in\nrecent years, aiming to bridge the gap between the efficiency of biological\nneural networks and the performance of artificial intelligence systems. This\npaper introduces Mamba-Spike, a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates\na spiking front-end with the Mamba backbone to achieve efficient and robust\ntemporal data processing. The proposed approach leverages the event-driven\nnature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to capture and process asynchronous,\ntime-varying inputs, while harnessing the power of the Mamba backbone's\nselective state spaces and linear-time sequence modeling capabilities to model\ncomplex temporal dependencies effectively. The spiking front-end of Mamba-Spike\nemploys biologically inspired neuron models, along with adaptive threshold and\nsynaptic dynamics. These components enable efficient spatiotemporal feature\nextraction and encoding of the input data. The Mamba backbone, on the other\nhand, utilizes a hierarchical structure with gated recurrent units and\nattention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and selectively process\nrelevant information. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, a\ncomprehensive empirical study is conducted on both neuromorphic datasets,\nincluding DVS Gesture and TIDIGITS, and standard datasets, such as Sequential\nMNIST and CIFAR10-DVS. The results demonstrate that Mamba-Spike consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy, lower\nlatency, and improved energy efficiency.

    "abstract": "While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent\nyears, the prevalent issue known as the `hallucination' problem has emerged as\na significant bottleneck, hindering their real-world deployments. Existing\nmethods mitigate this issue mainly from two perspectives: One approach\nleverages extra knowledge like robust instruction tuning LVLMs with curated\ndatasets or employing auxiliary analysis networks, which inevitable incur\nadditional costs. Another approach, known as contrastive decoding, induces\nhallucinations by manually disturbing the vision or instruction raw inputs and\nmitigates them by contrasting the outputs of the disturbed and original LVLMs.\nHowever, these approaches rely on empirical holistic input disturbances and\ndouble the inference cost. To avoid these issues, we propose a simple yet\neffective method named Self-Introspective Decoding (SID). Our empirical\ninvestigation reveals that pretrained LVLMs can introspectively assess the\nimportance of vision tokens based on preceding vision and text (both\ninstruction and generated) tokens. We develop the Context and Text-aware Token\nSelection (CT2S) strategy, which preserves only unimportant vision tokens after\nearly layers of LVLMs to adaptively amplify text-informed hallucination during\nthe auto-regressive decoding. This approach ensures that multimodal knowledge\nabsorbed in the early layers induces multimodal contextual rather than aimless\nhallucinations. Subsequently, the original token logits subtract the amplified\nvision-and-text association hallucinations, guiding LVLMs decoding faithfully.\nExtensive experiments illustrate SID generates less-hallucination and\nhigher-quality texts across various metrics, without extra knowledge and much\nadditional computation burdens.",

Our model performance in identifying\nand classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human\nexperts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the\nsignificance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for\ncomplex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is\nvalidated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering\ncontinuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which\nultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.",

    "abstract": "Wearable systems provide continuous health monitoring and can lead to early\ndetection of potential health issues. However, the lifecycle of wearable\nsystems faces several challenges. First, effective model training for new\nwearable devices requires substantial labeled data from various subjects\ncollected directly by the wearable. Second, subsequent model updates require\nfurther extensive labeled data for retraining. Finally, frequent model updating\non the wearable device can decrease the battery life in long-term data\nmonitoring. Addressing these challenges, in this paper, we propose MetaWearS, a\nmeta-learning method to reduce the amount of initial data collection required.\nMoreover, our approach incorporates a prototypical updating mechanism,\nsimplifying the update process by modifying the class prototype rather than\nretraining the entire model. We explore the performance of MetaWearS in two\ncase studies, namely, the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of\natrial fibrillation. We show that by fine-tuning with just a few samples, we\nachieve 70% and 82% AUC for the detection of epileptic seizures and the\ndetection of atrial fibrillation, respectively. Compared to a conventional\napproach, our proposed method performs better with up to 45% AUC. Furthermore,\nupdating the model with only 16 minutes of additional labeled data increases\nthe AUC by up to 5.3%. Finally, MetaWearS reduces the energy consumption for\nmodel updates by 456x and 418x for epileptic seizure and AF detection,\nrespectively.",

To\nhandle this challenge, we draw inspiration from human memory and learning\nmechanisms and propose the Self-Reflective Complementary Incremental System\n(SR-CIS). Comprising the deconstructed Complementary Inference Module (CIM) and\nComplementary Memory Module (CMM), SR-CIS features a small model for fast\ninference and a large model for slow deliberation in CIM, enabled by the\nConfidence-Aware Online Anomaly Detection (CA-OAD) mechanism for efficient\ncollaboration.

By storing textual descriptions of\nimages during training and combining them with the Scenario Replay Module (SRM)\npost-training for memory combination, along with periodic short-to-long-term\nmemory restructuring, SR-CIS achieves stable incremental memory with limited\nstorage requirements.

The ML-EAT addresses issues of ambiguity and\ndifficulty in interpreting the traditional EAT measurement by quantifying bias\nat three levels of increasing granularity: the differential association between\ntwo target concepts with two attribute concepts; the individual effect size of\neach target concept with two attribute concepts; and the association between\neach individual target concept and each individual attribute concept.

We wanted to understand where fact-checking organizations use open\nmodels in their data science pipelines; what motivates their use of open models\nor proprietary models; and how their use of open or proprietary models can\ninform research on the societal impact of generative AI.

As AI begins to absorb some of the\nepistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two\ncountries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would\nprefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers\nlearned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs),\ncomparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and\nNepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal\nproblems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers\nin the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about\nteenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss\nsocietal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness,\nand sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less\ndominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents\nand N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from\nteenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship.\nParticipant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated\nfrom SWE associations, with Pearson's r=.02, n.s. in English FastText and\nr=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and r=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and r=-.23, n.s. in\nGloVe. U.S. participants suggested AI could fairly present teens by\nhighlighting diversity, while Nepalese participants centered positivity.\nParticipants were optimistic that, if it learned from adolescents, rather than\nmedia sources, AI could help mitigate stereotypes.

To adapt SD to anomaly detection task, we design different\nhierarchical text descriptions and the foreground mask mechanism for\nfine-tuning SD. In the inference stage, to accurately mask anomalous regions\nfor inpainting, we propose multi-scale mask strategy and prototype-guided mask\nstrategy to handle diverse anomalous regions. Hierarchical text prompts are\nalso utilized to guide the process of inpainting in the inference stage. The\nanomaly score is estimated based on inpainting result of all masks.

The key to achieving\nthis goal is to avoid confusion at the feature level, i.e., avoiding confusion\nwithin old tasks and between new and old tasks. Previous prototype-based CL\nmethods generate pseudo features for old knowledge replay by adding Gaussian\nnoise to the centroids of old classes. However, the distribution in the feature\nspace exhibits anisotropy during the incremental process, which prevents the\npseudo features from faithfully reproducing the distribution of old knowledge\nin the feature space, leading to confusion in classification boundaries within\nold tasks. To address this issue, we propose the Distribution-Level Memory\nRecall (DMR) method, which uses a Gaussian mixture model to precisely fit the\nfeature distribution of old knowledge at the distribution level and generate\npseudo features in the next stage. Furthermore, resistance to confusion at the\ndistribution level is also crucial for multimodal learning, as the problem of\nmultimodal imbalance results in significant differences in feature responses\nbetween different modalities, exacerbating confusion within old tasks in\nprototype-based CL methods. Therefore, we mitigate the multi-modal imbalance\nproblem by using the Inter-modal Guidance and Intra-modal Mining (IGIM) method\nto guide weaker modalities with prior information from dominant modalities and\nfurther explore useful information within modalities. For the second key, We\npropose the Confusion Index to quantitatively describe a model's ability to\ndistinguish between new and old tasks, and we use the Incremental Mixup Feature\nEnhancement (IMFE) method to enhance pseudo features with new sample features,\nalleviating classification confusion between new and old knowledge.",

By\nvisual grounding, we obtain an object-grounded confidence map for the target\nobject indicated in the instruction. Based on this map, we introduce two routes\nto transfer VLM knowledge into RL.

Single-task experiments prove that our\nintrinsic reward significantly improves performance on challenging skill\nlearning.

In this paper, we address this asymmetry\nby defining two types of risk (decision and composite risk), and proposing an\nexperimental framework consisting of a two-level inference architecture and\nappropriate metrics for measuring such risks in both discriminative and\ngenerative LLMs. The first level relies on a decision rule that determines\nwhether the underlying language model should abstain from inference. The second\nlevel (which applies if the model does not abstain) is the model's inference.\nDetailed experiments on four natural language commonsense reasoning datasets\nusing both an open-source ensemble-based RoBERTa model and ChatGPT, demonstrate\nthe practical utility of the evaluation framework. For example, our results\nshow that our framework can get an LLM to confidently respond to an extra 20.1%\nof low-risk inference tasks that other methods might misclassify as high-risk,\nand skip 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable capabilities,\nspanning a wide range of tasks and applications, including those in the medical\ndomain. Models like GPT-4 excel in medical question answering but may face\nchallenges in the lack of interpretability when handling complex tasks in real\nclinical settings. We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for\nclinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and\ninterpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 511 clinical\nnotes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic\nreasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis.\nAdditionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential\nknowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of\nexisting LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant\ngap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the\ncritical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Query intent classification is an essential module for customers to find\ndesired products on the e-commerce application quickly. Most existing query\nintent classification methods rely on the users' click behavior as a supervised\nsignal to construct training samples. However, these methods based entirely on\nposterior labels may lead to serious category imbalance problems because of the\nMatthew effect in click samples. Compared with popular categories, it is\ndifficult for products under long-tail categories to obtain traffic and user\nclicks, which makes the models unable to detect users' intent for products\nunder long-tail categories. This in turn aggravates the problem that long-tail\ncategories cannot obtain traffic, forming a vicious circle. In addition, due to\nthe randomness of the user's click, the posterior label is unstable for the\nquery with similar semantics, which makes the model very sensitive to the\ninput, leading to an unstable and incomplete recall of categories.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Multi-channel Graph\nConvolutional Network (SMGCN) to address the above problems from the\nperspective of label association and semi-supervised learning. SMGCN extends\ncategory information and enhances the posterior label by utilizing the\nsimilarity score between the query and categories. Furthermore, it leverages\nthe co-occurrence and semantic similarity graph of categories to strengthen the\nrelations among labels and weaken the influence of posterior label instability.\nWe conduct extensive offline and online A/B experiments, and the experimental\nresults show that SMGCN significantly outperforms the strong baselines, which\nshows its effectiveness and practicality.",

    "abstract": "Process models are frequently used in software engineering to describe\nbusiness requirements, guide software testing and control system improvement.\nHowever, traditional process modeling methods often require the participation\nof numerous experts, which is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the\nexploration of a more efficient and cost-effective automated modeling method\nhas emerged as a focal point in current research. This article explores a\nframework for automatically generating process models with multi-agent\norchestration (MAO), aiming to enhance the efficiency of process modeling and\noffer valuable insights for domain experts. Our framework MAO leverages large\nlanguage models as the cornerstone for multi-agent, employing an innovative\nprompt strategy to ensure efficient collaboration among multi-agent.\nSpecifically, 1) generation. The first phase of MAO is to generate a slightly\nrough process model from the text description; 2) refinement. The agents would\ncontinuously refine the initial process model through multiple rounds of\ndialogue; 3) reviewing. Large language models are prone to hallucination\nphenomena among multi-turn dialogues, so the agents need to review and repair\nsemantic hallucinations in process models; 4) testing. The representation of\nprocess models is diverse. Consequently, the agents utilize external tools to\ntest whether the generated process model contains format errors, namely format\nhallucinations, and then adjust the process model to conform to the output\nparadigm. The experiments demonstrate that the process models generated by our\nframework outperform existing methods and surpass manual modeling by 89%, 61%,\n52%, and 75% on four different datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the first method to modify the prosodic features of\na given speech signal using actor-critic reinforcement learning strategy. Our\napproach uses a Bayesian framework to identify contiguous segments of\nimportance that links segments of the given utterances to perception of\nemotions in humans. We train a neural network to produce the variational\nposterior of a collection of Bernoulli random variables; our model applies a\nMarkov prior on it to ensure continuity. A sample from this distribution is\nused for downstream emotion prediction. Further, we train the neural network to\npredict a soft assignment over emotion categories as the target variable. In\nthe next step, we modify the prosodic features (pitch, intensity, and rhythm)\nof the masked segment to increase the score of target emotion. We employ an\nactor-critic reinforcement learning to train the prosody modifier by\ndiscretizing the space of modifications. Further, it provides a simple solution\nto the problem of gradient computation through WSOLA operation for rhythm\nmanipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that this framework changes the\nperceived emotion of a given speech utterance to the target. Further, we show\nthat our unified technique is on par with state-of-the-art emotion conversion\nmodels from supervised and unsupervised domains that require pairwise training.",

    "abstract": "Pretrained large Language Models (LLMs) are able to answer questions that are\nunlikely to have been encountered during training. However a diversity of\npotential applications exist in the broad domain of reasoning systems and\nconsiderations such as latency, cost, available compute resource and internet\nconnectivity are relevant in determining an appropriate approach. We consider\nthe setting where some local compute capacity is available at inference time\nbut internet connectivity is not.\n  Similar to a general-purpose LLM, we assume that our much smaller Reasoning\nModels may be asked arbitrary questions from unknown distributions, so we focus\non evaluation in an unseen setting. We train our models to answer diverse\nquestions by instilling an ability to reason over a retrieved context. We\nacquire context from two knowledge sources; a Wikipedia corpus queried using a\nmulti-hop dense retrieval system with novel extensions, and from rationales\ngenerated from a larger Language Model optimised to run in a lower resource\nenvironment.\n  Our main contributions: We propose novel methods to show that our model is\ncapable of answering contextualised questions without memorisation. We\nestablish a comprehensive set of baseline results on unseen evaluation\ndatasets. We show that the addition of novel retrieval-augmented training\ndatasets (RATD) to the training regime of the Reasoning Model significantly\nimproves results. We demonstrate further significant improvement through the\napplication of methods for combining knowledge from two sources. The first\nmethod (RR) involves training a novel Rationale Ranking model to score both\ngenerated rationales and retrieved contexts with respect to relevance and\ntruthfulness. We use the scores to derive combined contexts. We also show that\nutilising the RATD datasets enables our model to become proficient at utilising\ncombined noisy contexts.",

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter tuning remains a significant challenge for the training of\ndeep neural networks (DNNs), requiring manual and/or time-intensive grid\nsearches, increasing resource costs and presenting a barrier to the\ndemocratization of machine learning. The global initial learning rate for DNN\ntraining is particularly important. Several techniques have been proposed for\nautomated learning rate tuning during training; however, they still require\nmanual searching for the global initial learning rate. Though methods exist\nthat do not require this initial selection, they suffer from poor performance.\nHere, we present ExpTest, a sophisticated method for initial learning rate\nsearching and subsequent learning rate tuning for the training of DNNs. ExpTest\ndraws on insights from linearized neural networks and the form of the loss\ncurve, which we treat as a real-time signal upon which we perform hypothesis\ntesting. We mathematically justify ExpTest and provide empirical support.\nExpTest requires minimal overhead, is robust to hyperparameter choice, and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks and architectures,\nwithout initial learning rate selection or learning rate scheduling.",

We introduce RoCoDA, a novel method that unifies the concepts of\ninvariance, equivariance, and causality within a single framework to enhance\ndata augmentation for imitation learning. RoCoDA leverages causal invariance by\nmodifying task-irrelevant subsets of the environment state without affecting\nthe policy's output. Simultaneously, we exploit SE(3) equivariance by applying\nrigid body transformations to object poses and adjusting corresponding actions\nto generate synthetic demonstrations. We validate RoCoDA through extensive\nexperiments on five robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating improvements in\npolicy performance, generalization, and sample efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our policies exhibit robust\ngeneralization to unseen object poses, textures, and the presence of\ndistractors. Furthermore, we observe emergent behavior such as re-grasping,\nindicating policies trained with RoCoDA possess a deeper understanding of task\ndynamics. By leveraging invariance, equivariance, and causality, RoCoDA\nprovides a principled approach to data augmentation in imitation learning,\nbridging the gap between geometric symmetries and causal reasoning.

Our study employs two approaches: a custom-implemented tiled matrix\nmultiplication kernel for fundamental analysis, and NVIDIA's CUTLASS library\nfor comprehensive performance data collection across advanced configurations.\nUsing the NVIDIA RTX 4070 as our experimental platform, we developed a Random\nForest-based prediction model with multi-output regression capability. Through\nanalysis of both naive tiled matrix multiplication with varying tile sizes (1\nto 32) and 16,128 CUTLASS GEMM operations across diverse configurations, we\nidentified critical performance patterns related to matrix dimensions, thread\nblock configurations, and memory access patterns.

The system\nsuccessfully predicts performance across matrix sizes, demonstrating robust\nscaling behavior. Our results show that optimal tile size selection can improve\nperformance by up to 3.2x while reducing power consumption by 22% compared to\nbaseline configurations. Analysis of shared memory utilization and SM occupancy\nreveals that tile sizes of 16x16 achieve the best balance between parallelism\nand resource usage.

    "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires transforming agriculture to minimize\nenviron mental impact and build climate resilience. Regenerative agricultural\npractices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health\nand sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture\npractices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is\naffected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors\nand farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an\nAI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex\nmulti-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil\nhealth and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data\n(e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland\ninformation and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that\nintegrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized\nanalysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices\nacross California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity\nmay mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather\nconditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally,\nimplementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants,\npolicymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies\nthat promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.",

This\nnecessitates precisely determining the optimal model size and training\nhyperparameters before large-scale training. While scaling laws are employed in\nlanguage models to predict performance, their existence and accurate derivation\nin visual generation models remain underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze scaling laws for video diffusion transformers and\nconfirm their presence. Moreover, we discover that, unlike language models,\nvideo diffusion models are more sensitive to learning rate and batch size, two\nhyperparameters often not precisely modeled. To address this, we propose a new\nscaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and\ncompute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance\nand reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods,\nwithin a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more\ngeneralized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and\ncompute budget.

However, these models frequently encounter a core\nissue of \"cognitive misalignment\" between the vision encoder (VE) and the large\nlanguage model (LLM). Specifically, the VE's representation of visual\ninformation may not fully align with LLM's cognitive framework, leading to a\nmismatch where visual features exceed the language model's interpretive range.\nTo address this, we investigate how variations in VE representations influence\nLVLM comprehension, especially when the LLM faces VE-Unknown data-images whose\nambiguous visual representations challenge the VE's interpretive precision.\nAccordingly, we construct a multi-granularity landmark dataset and\nsystematically examine the impact of VE-Known and VE-Unknown data on\ninterpretive abilities. Our results show that VE-Unknown data limits LVLM's\ncapacity for accurate understanding, while VE-Known data, rich in distinctive\nfeatures, helps reduce cognitive misalignment. Building on these insights, we\npropose Entity-Enhanced Cognitive Alignment (EECA), a method that employs\nmulti-granularity supervision to generate visually enriched, well-aligned\ntokens that not only integrate within the LLM's embedding space but also align\nwith the LLM's cognitive framework.

    "abstract": "Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the\npoint where traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such\nas ROUGE, have become saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce\nunwanted content into summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or\nunsupported by their source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle\n``hallucinations'' automatically has proved to be challenging. This in turn has\nmotivated development of a variety of metrics intended to measure the factual\nconsistency of generated summaries against their source. But are these\napproaches measuring what they purport to do? In this work, we stress-test\nautomatic factuality metrics. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what\ndegree superficial attributes of summary texts suffice to predict\n``factuality'', finding that a (supervised) model using only such shallow\nfeatures is reasonably competitive with SOTA factuality scoring methods. We\nthen evaluate how factuality metrics respond to factual corrections in\ninconsistent summaries and find that only a few show meaningful improvements.\nIn contrast, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, non-factual edits.\nMotivated by these insights, we show that one can ``game'' (most) automatic\nfactuality metrics, i.e., reliably inflate ``factuality'' scores by appending\ninnocuous sentences to generated summaries. Taken together, our results raise\nquestions about the degree to which we should rely on existing automated\nfactuality metrics and what exactly we want ``factuality metrics'' to measure.",

However, producing similar adversarial examples in the physical world has\nbeen difficult due to the non-differentiable image distortion functions in\nvisual sensing systems. The existing algorithms for generating physically\nrealizable adversarial examples often loosen their definition of adversarial\nexamples by allowing unbounded perturbations, resulting in obvious or even\nstrange visual patterns. In this work, we make adversarial examples\nimperceptible in the physical world using a straight-through estimator (STE,\na.k.a. BPDA). We employ STE to overcome the non-differentiability -- applying\nexact, non-differentiable distortions in the forward pass of the\nbackpropagation step, and using the identity function in the backward pass. Our\ndifferentiable rendering extension to STE also enables imperceptible\nadversarial patches in the physical world. Using printout photos, and\nexperiments in the CARLA simulator, we show that STE enables fast generation of\n$\\ell_\\infty$ bounded adversarial examples despite the non-differentiable\ndistortions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating\nimperceptible adversarial examples bounded by small $\\ell_\\infty$ norms in the\nphysical world that force zero classification accuracy in the global\nperturbation threat model and cause near-zero ($4.22\\%$) AP50 in object\ndetection in the patch perturbation threat model.

However, traditional\nmethods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging\nsubtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) inspire the \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm, where LLMs\nare leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks\nand applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based\njudgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging\nfield. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output\nperspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore\nLLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to\njudge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and\nhighlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable\ninsights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) to spend more time thinking and\nreflection before responding is crucial for effectively solving complex\nreasoning tasks in fields such as science, coding, and mathematics. However,\nthe effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correction\ndepends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, which\ncan be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, and\nthe lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-player\nparadigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the\ncritique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor)\nmodel during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique,\nan automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in\na dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning\nlanguage models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language\nfeedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models\nconsistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time,\nespecially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these\nfindings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's\nself-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement\nmethod. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration\nefficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading\nto a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to explore\ntraining self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase its\npotential.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic agents are used in a variety of competitive decision settings,\nnotably in making pricing decisions in contexts that range from online retail\nto residential home rentals. Business managers, algorithm designers, legal\nscholars, and regulators alike are all starting to consider the ramifications\nof \"algorithmic collusion.\" We study the emergent behavior of multi-armed\nbandit machine learning algorithms used in situations where agents are\ncompeting, but they have no information about the strategic interaction they\nare engaged in. Using a general-form repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, agents\nengage in online learning with no prior model of game structure and no\nknowledge of competitors' states or actions (e.g., no observation of competing\nprices). We show that these context-free bandits, with no knowledge of\nopponents' choices or outcomes, still will consistently learn collusive\nbehavior - what we call \"naive collusion.\" We primarily study this system\nthrough an analytical model and examine perturbations to the model through\nsimulations.\n  Our findings have several notable implications for regulators. First, calls\nto limit algorithms from conditioning on competitors' prices are insufficient\nto prevent algorithmic collusion. This is a direct result of collusion arising\neven in the naive setting. Second, symmetry in algorithms can increase\ncollusion potential. This highlights a new, simple mechanism for\n\"hub-and-spoke\" algorithmic collusion. A central distributor need not imbue its\nalgorithm with supra-competitive tendencies for apparent collusion to arise; it\ncan simply arise by using certain (common) machine learning algorithms.\nFinally, we highlight that collusive outcomes depend starkly on the specific\nalgorithm being used, and we highlight market and algorithmic conditions under\nwhich it will be unknown a priori whether collusion occurs.",

While structured\nphysiological data provides quantitative insights, clinical notes offer\nunstructured, context-rich narratives.

Using the MIMIC-III database, we analyzed time-series\nphysiological data and clinical notes from the first 48 hours of ICU admission.\nClinical notes were concatenated chronologically for each patient and\ntransformed into expert summaries using Med42-v2 70B. A multi-representational\nlearning framework was developed to integrate these data sources, leveraging\nLLMs to enhance textual data while mitigating direct reliance on LLM\npredictions, which can introduce challenges in uncertainty quantification and\ninterpretability. The proposed model achieved an AUPRC of 0.6156 (+36.41%) and\nan AUROC of 0.8955 (+7.64%) compared to a time-series-only baseline. Expert\nsummaries outperformed clinical notes or time-series data alone, demonstrating\nthe value of LLM-generated knowledge. Performance gains were consistent across\ndemographic groups, with notable improvements in underrepresented populations,\nunderscoring the framework's equitable application potential. By integrating\nLLM-generated summaries with structured and unstructured data, the framework\ncaptures complementary patient information, significantly improving predictive\nperformance.

Moreover, our\ninvestigation extends beyond mathematical reasoning to explore the\ngeneralization capabilities of O1-distilled models across diverse tasks:\nhallucination, safety and open-domain QA. Notably, despite training only on\nmathematical problem-solving data, our models demonstrated strong\ngeneralization to open-ended QA tasks and became significantly less susceptible\nto sycophancy after fine-tuning. We deliberately make this finding public to\npromote transparency in AI research and to challenge the current trend of\nobscured technical claims in the field. Our work includes: (1) A detailed\ntechnical exposition of the distillation process and its effectiveness, (2) A\ncomprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and categorizing O1\nreplication attempts based on their technical transparency and reproducibility,\n(3) A critical discussion of the limitations and potential risks of\nover-relying on distillation approaches, our analysis culminates in a crucial\nbitter lesson: while the pursuit of more capable AI systems is important, the\ndevelopment of researchers grounded in first-principles thinking is paramount.",

Traditional DA methods often face a trade-off between\ncomputational cost and accuracy due to complex linear algebra computations and\nthe high dimensionality of the model, especially in nonlinear systems.\nMoreover, processing massive data in real-time requires substantial\ncomputational resources. To address this, we introduce an artificial\nintelligence-based data assimilation framework (ADAF) to generate high-quality\nkilometer-scale analysis. This study is the pioneering work using real-world\nobservations from varied locations and multiple sources to verify the AI\nmethod's efficacy in DA, including sparse surface weather observations and\nsatellite imagery.

Sensitivity experiments reveal that ADAF can\ngenerate high-quality analysis even with low-accuracy backgrounds and extremely\nsparse surface observations. ADAF can assimilate massive observations within a\nthree-hour window at low computational cost, taking about two seconds on an AMD\nMI200 graphics processing unit (GPU).

The related literature in this field is very limited, since most of\nthe solutions focus only on on-device inference or model adaptation through\nonline learning, leaving the training to be carried out on external Cloud\nservices. An interesting technological perspective is to exploit Federated\nLearning (FL), which allows multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel in a distributed way. However, the main drawback of state-of-the-art FL\nalgorithms is that they are not suitable for running on tiny devices.

Besides the traditional full-network operating\nmodality, in which each device of the FL setting trains the entire neural\nnetwork on its own local data, we propose an innovative single-layer TIFeD\nimplementation, which enables each device to train only a portion of the neural\nnetwork model and opens the door to a new way of distributing the learning\nprocedure across multiple devices.

Semantic segmentation for\nautonomous driving faces a wide range of domain shifts, e.g. caused by changing\nweather conditions, new geolocations and the frequent use of synthetic data in\nmodel training. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have emerged which\nadapt a model to a new target domain by only using unlabeled data of that\ndomain. The variety of UDA methods is large but all of them use ImageNet\npre-trained models. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated strong\ngeneralization capabilities which may facilitate domain adaptation. We show\nthat simply replacing the encoder of existing UDA methods like DACS by a\nvision-language pre-trained encoder can result in significant performance\nimprovements of up to 10.0% mIoU on the GTA5-to-Cityscapes domain shift. For\nthe generalization performance to unseen domains, the newly employed\nvision-language pre-trained encoder provides a gain of up to 13.7% mIoU across\nthree unseen datasets. However, we find that not all UDA methods can be easily\npaired with the new encoder and that the UDA performance does not always\nlikewise transfer into generalization performance.

To this end, we propose a CTC-based draft model which\nstrengthens the correlations between draft tokens during the draft phase,\nthereby generating higher-quality draft candidate sequences. Experiment results\nshow that compared to strong baselines, the proposed method can achieve a\nhigher acceptance rate and hence a faster inference speed.",

Moreover, in many\nof the settings where the shutdown problem is most concerning, AIs might have\nvast amounts of private information. To capture these differences in knowledge,\nwe introduce the Partially Observable Off-Switch Game (PO-OSG), a\ngame-theoretic model of the shutdown problem with asymmetric information.\nUnlike when the human has full observability, we find that in optimal play,\neven AI agents assisting perfectly rational humans sometimes avoid shutdown. As\nexpected, increasing the amount of communication or information available\nalways increases (or leaves unchanged) the agents' expected common payoff. But\ncounterintuitively, introducing bounded communication can make the AI defer to\nthe human less in optimal play even though communication mitigates information\nasymmetry. In particular, communication sometimes enables new optimal behavior\nrequiring strategic AI deference to achieve outcomes that were previously\ninaccessible. Thus, designing safe artificial agents in the presence of\nasymmetric information requires careful consideration of the tradeoffs between\nmaximizing payoffs (potentially myopically) and maintaining AIs' incentives to\ndefer to humans.",

    "abstract": "One of the difficulties imposed on the manipulation of deformable objects is\ntheir characterization and the detection of representative keypoints for the\npurpose of manipulation. A keen interest was manifested by researchers in the\nlast decade to characterize and manipulate deformable objects of non-fluid\nnature, such as clothes and ropes. Even though several propositions were made\nin the regard of object characterization, however researchers were always\nconfronted with the need of pixel-level information of the object through\nimages to extract relevant information. This usually is accomplished by means\nof segmentation networks trained on manually labeled data for this purpose. In\nthis paper, we address the subject of characterizing weld pool to define stable\nfeatures that serve as information for further motion control objectives. We\nachieve this by employing different pipelines. The first one consists of\ncharacterizing fluid deformable objects through the use of a generative model\nthat is trained using a teacher-student framework. And in the second one we\nleverage foundation models by using them as teachers to characterize the object\nin the image, without the need of any pre-training and any dataset. The\nperformance of knowledge distillation from foundation models into a smaller\ngenerative model shows prominent results in the characterization of deformable\nobjects. The student network was capable of learning to retrieve the keypoitns\nof the object with an error of 13.4 pixels. And the teacher was evaluated based\non its capacities to retrieve pixel level information represented by the object\nmask, with a mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of 75.26%.",

However, conventional\nultrasound diagnostics face several limitations, including high dependence on\nphysician expertise and suboptimal image quality, which complicates\ninterpretation and increases the likelihood of diagnostic errors. Artificial\nintelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance clinical\ndiagnosis, particularly in detecting abnormalities across various biomedical\nimaging modalities.

Second, most\nexisting models are task-specific, which restricts their broader clinical\nutility. To overcome these challenges, we present UltraFedFM, an innovative\nprivacy-preserving ultrasound foundation model. UltraFedFM is collaboratively\npre-trained using federated learning across 16 distributed medical institutions\nin 9 countries, leveraging a dataset of over 1 million ultrasound images\ncovering 19 organs and 10 ultrasound modalities. This extensive and diverse\ndata, combined with a secure training framework, enables UltraFedFM to exhibit\nstrong generalization and diagnostic capabilities. It achieves an average area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.927 for disease\ndiagnosis and a dice similarity coefficient of 0.878 for lesion segmentation.\nNotably, UltraFedFM surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of mid-level\nultrasonographers and matches the performance of expert-level sonographers in\nthe joint diagnosis of 8 common systemic diseases.

Furthermore, their widespread\napplicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related\nto the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has\nbeen extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model\nignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to\nprevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a\nsubstantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its\nswift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive\noverview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of\nuncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the\napplication to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of\nuncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical\ninconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating\nprediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for\nbetter generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows\nthat includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and\nevaluation of the available methods.

Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here\npropose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum\ncircuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling'\nmechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly\ntrained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a\ndesigner unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to\nlarge-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk\nerrors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the\nparameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results\nindicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in\nefficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale\nsuperconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our\nGNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec.\nOverall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing\nparameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially\ndemonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.",

Previous work on the\nsize and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results.\nIn this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop\nreasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable\nevidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct\nand GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering\ntwo-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent\nreasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However,\nto our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when\nlearned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level\naccuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose\nseparately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier\nLLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT\nreasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial\nsuccess with CoT across most categories.

    "abstract": "Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for tool planning has emerged as a\npromising avenue for developing general AI systems, where LLMs automatically\nschedule external tools (e.g. vision models) to tackle complex tasks based on\ntask descriptions. To push this paradigm toward practical applications, it is\ncrucial for LLMs to consider tool execution costs (e.g. execution time) for\ntool planning. Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs,\nleading to the generation of expensive plans of which the costs outweigh task\nperformance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with\nLLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design\nto empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, CATP-LLM\nincorporates a tool planning language to enhance the LLM to generate\nnon-sequential plans of multiple branches for efficient concurrent tool\nexecution and cost reduction. Moreover, it further designs a cost-aware offline\nreinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the\nperformance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In lack of public cost-related\ndatasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first platform for cost-aware\nplanning evaluation. Experiments on OpenCATP show that CATP-LLM outperforms\nGPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement\nof 28.2%-30.2% higher plan performance and 24.7%-45.8% lower costs even on the\nchallenging planning tasks.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful generative capabilities and\nvast knowledge, empower various tasks in everyday life. However, these\nabilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving\nlow-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively\nlimited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore\ncrucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive\napproach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct\ninstruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for\nover 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing\n2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from\nhigh-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment.\nTo achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions,\ncomprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and\ncross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning\nbased on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages.\nUsing Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B,\nand BayLing-2-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For\nmultilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior\nperformance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual\nknowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant\nimprovements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its\ncapability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource\nlanguages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing\nmaintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the\nperformance in low-resource languages.

However, most of current\nbatch approaches do not scale well with the batch size. That is, their\nperformances deteriorate dramatically as the batch size increases. To address\nthis issue, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian\noptimization to large-scale batch evaluation in this work. Different from\nexisting batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of\naxis-aligned subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point\nfrom each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace\nimprovement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate\npoint can achieve within a certain axis-aligned subspace. By optimizing these\nexpected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of\nquery points for parallel evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our\nproposed approach can speedup the convergence significantly when compared with\nthe sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively\nwhen compared with seven batch Bayesian optimization algorithms.

    "abstract": "Recognition of low-quality face images remains a challenge due to invisible\nor deformation in partial facial regions. For low-quality images dominated by\nmissing partial facial regions, local region similarity contributes more to\nface recognition (FR). Conversely, in cases dominated by local face\ndeformation, excessive attention to local regions may lead to misjudgments,\nwhile global features exhibit better robustness. However, most of the existing\nFR methods neglect the bias in feature quality of low-quality images introduced\nby different factors. To address this issue, we propose a Local and Global\nFeature Attention Fusion (LGAF) network based on feature quality. The network\nadaptively allocates attention between local and global features according to\nfeature quality and obtains more discriminative and high-quality face features\nthrough local and global information complementarity. In addition, to\neffectively obtain fine-grained information at various scales and increase the\nseparability of facial features in high-dimensional space, we introduce a\nMulti-Head Multi-Scale Local Feature Extraction (MHMS) module. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the LGAF achieves the best average performance on $4$\nvalidation sets (CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, and CALFW), and the performance on\nTinyFace and SCFace outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (SoTA).",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant strides made by generative AI in just a few short\nyears, its future progress is constrained by the challenge of building modular\nand robust systems. This capability has been a cornerstone of past\ntechnological revolutions, which relied on combining components to create\nincreasingly sophisticated and reliable systems. Cars, airplanes, computers,\nand software consist of components-such as engines, wheels, CPUs, and\nlibraries-that can be assembled, debugged, and replaced. A key tool for\nbuilding such reliable and modular systems is specification: the precise\ndescription of the expected behavior, inputs, and outputs of each component.\nHowever, the generality of LLMs and the inherent ambiguity of natural language\nmake defining specifications for LLM-based components (e.g., agents) both a\nchallenging and urgent problem. In this paper, we discuss the progress the\nfield has made so far-through advances like structured outputs, process\nsupervision, and test-time compute-and outline several future directions for\nresearch to enable the development of modular and reliable LLM-based systems\nthrough improved specifications.",

Additionally,\nwe showcase the ramifications of LLMPirate using case studies on IBEX and\nMOR1KX processors and a GPS module, that we successfully pirate.

    "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the inner workings of large\nneural networks by identifying circuits, or minimal subgraphs within the model\nthat implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks. These\ncircuits are typically discovered and analyzed using a narrowly defined prompt\nformat. However, given the abilities of large language models (LLMs) to\ngeneralize across various prompt formats for the same task, it remains unclear\nhow well these circuits generalize. For instance, it is unclear whether the\nmodels generalization results from reusing the same circuit components, the\ncomponents behaving differently, or the use of entirely different components.\nIn this paper, we investigate the generality of the indirect object\nidentification (IOI) circuit in GPT-2 small, which is well-studied and believed\nto implement a simple, interpretable algorithm. We evaluate its performance on\nprompt variants that challenge the assumptions of this algorithm. Our findings\nreveal that the circuit generalizes surprisingly well, reusing all of its\ncomponents and mechanisms while only adding additional input edges. Notably,\nthe circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm\nshould fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2\nHacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible\nand general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying\ncircuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Although Deep Learning (DL) methods becoming increasingly popular in\nvulnerability detection, their performance is seriously limited by insufficient\ntraining data. This is mainly because few existing software organizations can\nmaintain a complete set of high-quality samples for DL-based vulnerability\ndetection. Due to the concerns about privacy leakage, most of them are\nreluctant to share data, resulting in the data silo problem. Since enables\ncollaboratively model training without data sharing, Federated Learning (FL)\nhas been investigated as a promising means of addressing the data silo problem\nin DL-based vulnerability detection. However, since existing FL-based\nvulnerability detection methods focus on specific applications, it is still far\nunclear i) how well FL adapts to common vulnerability detection tasks and ii)\nhow to design a high-performance FL solution for a specific vulnerability\ndetection task. To answer these two questions, this paper first proposes VulFL,\nan effective evaluation framework for FL-based vulnerability detection. Then,\nbased on VulFL, this paper conducts a comprehensive study to reveal the\nunderlying capabilities of FL in dealing with different types of CWEs,\nespecially when facing various data heterogeneity scenarios. Our experimental\nresults show that, compared to independent training, FL can significantly\nimprove the detection performance of common AI models on all investigated CWEs,\nthough the performance of FL-based vulnerability detection is limited by\nheterogeneous data. To highlight the performance differences between different\nFL solutions for vulnerability detection, we extensively investigate the\nimpacts of different configuration strategies for each framework component of\nVulFL. Our study sheds light on the potential of FL in vulnerability detection,\nwhich can be used to guide the design of FL-based solutions for vulnerability\ndetection.",

Recent advancements in diffusion models and multimodal models have\nnotably improved the quality and efficiency of 3D object generation given a\nsingle RGB image. However, 3D objects generated even by state-of-the-art\nmethods are still unsatisfactory compared to human-created assets. Considering\nonly textures instead of materials makes these methods encounter challenges in\nphoto-realistic rendering, relighting, and flexible appearance editing. And\nthey also suffer from severe misalignment between geometry and high-frequency\ntexture details. In this work, we propose a novel approach to boost the quality\nof generated 3D objects from the perspective of Physics-Based Rendering (PBR)\nmaterials. By analyzing the components of PBR materials, we choose to consider\nalbedo, roughness, metalness, and bump maps. For albedo and bump maps, we\nleverage Stable Diffusion fine-tuned on synthetic data to extract these values,\nwith novel usages of these fine-tuned models to obtain 3D consistent albedo UV\nand bump UV for generated objects. In terms of roughness and metalness maps, we\nadopt a semi-automatic process to provide room for interactive adjustment,\nwhich we believe is more practical.

      "abstract": "Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent\ndecision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working\nmemory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than\necologically relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies\nhave primarily investigated working memory during single or few cognitive\ntasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is\nmaintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge\nthis gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained\nthem on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the\nRNN's latent space, we found that: (1) Multi-task RNNs represent both\ntask-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks;\n(2) The latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla\nRNNs are largely shared across tasks, but highly task-specific in gated RNNs\nsuch as GRU and LSTM; (3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new\nrepresentational spaces in which individual object features are less\northogonalized relative to the perceptual space; (4) The transformation of\nworking memory encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent\nspace) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing\nthe retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were\ndistinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ\nchronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans,\nenabling testable predictions with neural data.",

      "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations can be used to interpret and debug text\nclassifiers by producing minimally altered text inputs that change a\nclassifier's output. In this work, we evaluate five methods for generating\ncounterfactual explanations for a BERT text classifier on two datasets using\nthree evaluation metrics. The results of our experiments suggest that\nestablished white-box substitution-based methods are effective at generating\nvalid counterfactuals that change the classifier's output. In contrast, newer\nmethods based on large language models (LLMs) excel at producing natural and\nlinguistically plausible text counterfactuals but often fail to generate valid\ncounterfactuals that alter the classifier's output. Based on these results, we\nrecommend developing new counterfactual explanation methods that combine the\nstrengths of established gradient-based approaches and newer LLM-based\ntechniques to generate high-quality, valid, and plausible text counterfactual\nexplanations.",

Among the current limitations are major time commitments from domain\nexperts for accurate ground truth preparation; and the need for a large amount\nof input image data. We previously proposed a solution that overcomes these\nchallenges using OpenAI's GPT-4(V) model on a pilot dataset (Iba-1\nimmuno-stained tissue sections from 11 mouse brains). Results on the pilot\ndataset were equivalent in accuracy and with a substantial improvement in\nthroughput efficiency compared to the baseline using a traditional\nConvolutional Neural Net (CNN)-based approach.\n  The present study builds upon this framework using a second unique and\nsubstantially larger dataset of microscopy images. Our current approach uses a\nnewer and faster model, GPT-4o, along with improved prompts. It was evaluated\non a microscopy image dataset captured at low (10x) magnification from\ncresyl-violet-stained sections through the cerebellum of a total of 18 mouse\nbrains (9 Lurcher mice, 9 wild-type controls). We used our approach to classify\nthese images either as a control group or Lurcher mutant. Using 6 mice in the\nprompt set the results were correct classification for 11 out of the 12 mice\n(92%) with 96% higher efficiency, reduced image requirements, and lower demands\non time and effort of domain experts compared to the baseline method (snapshot\nensemble of CNN models).

Yet, recent work has shown that supposedly deleted information\ncan still be extracted by malicious actors through various attacks. Still,\ncurrent attacks retrieve sets of possible candidate generations and are unable\nto pinpoint the output that contains the actual target information. We propose\nactivation steering as a method for exact information retrieval from unlearned\nLLMs. We introduce a novel approach to generating steering vectors, named\nAnonymized Activation Steering. Additionally, we develop a simple word\nfrequency method to pinpoint the correct answer among a set of candidates when\nretrieving unlearned information. Our evaluation across multiple unlearning\ntechniques and datasets demonstrates that activation steering successfully\nrecovers general knowledge (e.g., widely known fictional characters) while\nrevealing limitations in retrieving specific information (e.g., details about\nnon-public individuals).

However, their interpretations may not be\nstraightforwardly linked to the meanings of their individual components in\nisolation and this may have an impact for compositional approaches. In this\npaper, we investigate to what extent word representation models are able to go\nbeyond compositional word combinations and capture multiword expression\nidiomaticity and some of the expected properties related to idiomatic meanings.\nWe focus on noun compounds of varying levels of idiomaticity in two languages\n(English and Portuguese), presenting a dataset of minimal pairs containing\nhuman idiomaticity judgments for each noun compound at both type and token\nlevels, their paraphrases and their occurrences in naturalistic and\nsense-neutral contexts, totalling 32,200 sentences. We propose this set of\nminimal pairs for evaluating how well a model captures idiomatic meanings, and\ndefine a set of fine-grained metrics of Affinity and Scaled Similarity, to\ndetermine how sensitive the models are to perturbations that may lead to\nchanges in idiomaticity. The results obtained with a variety of representative\nand widely used models indicate that, despite superficial indications to the\ncontrary in the form of high similarities, idiomaticity is not yet accurately\nrepresented in current models. Moreover, the performance of models with\ndifferent levels of contextualisation suggests that their ability to capture\ncontext is not yet able to go beyond more superficial lexical clues provided by\nthe words and to actually incorporate the relevant semantic clues needed for\nidiomaticity.",

Despite its\nimportance, formal verification of LLM factuality with such guarantees remains\nlargely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactTest, a novel framework\nthat statistically assesses whether a LLM can confidently provide correct\nanswers to given questions with high-probability correctness guarantees.

Our approach is distribution-free and works for any number of\nhuman-annotated samples. It is model-agnostic and applies to any black-box or\nwhite-box LM.

Systems in our framework are\ncharacterized by their ability to adapt and continually learn at multiple\nlevels of abstraction from diverse teaching modalities such as spoken dialogue,\nobject keypoints, and kinesthetic demonstrations. To enable such adaptation, we\ndesign lightweight and interpretable learning algorithms that allow users to\nbuild an understanding and co-adapt to a robot's capabilities in real-time, as\nthey teach new behaviors. For example, after demonstrating a new low-level\nskill for \"tracking around\" an object, users are provided with trajectory\nvisualizations of the robot's intended motion when asked to track a new object.\nSimilarly, users teach high-level planning behaviors through spoken dialogue,\nusing pretrained language models to synthesize behaviors such as \"packing an\nobject away\" as compositions of low-level skills $-$ concepts that can be\nreused and built upon. We evaluate Vocal Sandbox in two settings: collaborative\ngift bag assembly and LEGO stop-motion animation. In the first setting, we run\nsystematic ablations and user studies with 8 non-expert participants,\nhighlighting the impact of multi-level teaching. Across 23 hours of total robot\ninteraction time, users teach 17 new high-level behaviors with an average of 16\nnovel low-level skills, requiring 22.1% less active supervision compared to\nbaselines and yielding more complex autonomous performance (+19.7%) with fewer\nfailures (-67.1%). Qualitatively, users strongly prefer Vocal Sandbox systems\ndue to their ease of use (+20.6%) and overall performance (+13.9%). Finally, we\npair an experienced system-user with a robot to film a stop-motion animation;\nover two hours of continuous collaboration, the user teaches progressively more\ncomplex motion skills to shoot a 52 second (232 frame) movie.",

Generating these rules is time-consuming and often\nsub-optimal. As enterprises increasingly accumulate vast amounts of operational\ndata, there is significant potential to leverage this big data to enhance the\nperformance of automated systems. One promising approach is to use Decision\nTransformers, which can be trained on existing enterprise data to learn better\ndynamic dispatching rules for improving system throughput.

Our empirical results demonstrate that\nDecision Transformers can improve the material handling system's throughput by\na considerable amount when the heuristic originally used in the enterprise data\nexhibits moderate performance and involves no randomness. When the original\nheuristic has strong performance, Decision Transformers can still improve the\nthroughput but with a smaller improvement margin.

To use these images in downstream analysis, we need\nmodels that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse\nbiological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with\nsimilar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we\npresent the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new\n1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image\ncrops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a\n60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the\nbest overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and\nreplicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods\nthat improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and,\n(2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each\ntransformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome\nscreens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on\neither natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically\nmeaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks\nthan in their typically used final blocks.

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search\nscenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer\na specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries\nand retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing\ninformation retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a\nbroader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple\nmodalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first\nstudy fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16\nretrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever\nis capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and\nimage, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal\nretrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the\nissue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality\nbias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning\nthe universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability\nwhile preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model,\nMM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval\nbenchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing\nthe state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval\nbenchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot\nrerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal\nretriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further\nimprove multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed\nqueries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also\npave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.",

This discrepancy arises from the fact that\nLLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin\ncharacters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts.

However, the ability of\nvideo generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without\nhuman priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give\npredictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In\nthis work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution,\nout-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D\nsimulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos\ndeterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This\nprovides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and\nenables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to\nphysical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict\nobject movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect\ngeneralization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for\ncombinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios.\nFurther experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms\nof these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and\ninstead exhibit \"case-based\" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the\nclosest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are\nobserved to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color\n> size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is\ninsufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws,\ndespite its role in Sora's broader success.

Their ability to understand and generate human-like text\nhas opened up new possibilities for advancing scientific research, enabling\ntasks such as data analysis, literature review, and even experimental design.\nOne of the most promising applications of LLMs in this context is hypothesis\ngeneration, where they can identify novel research directions by analyzing\nexisting knowledge.

To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose KG-CoI (Knowledge Grounded Chain of Ideas), a novel system that\nenhances LLM hypothesis generation by integrating external, structured\nknowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). KG-CoI guides LLMs through a structured\nreasoning process, organizing their output as a chain of ideas (CoI), and\nincludes a KG-supported module for the detection of hallucinations.

      "abstract": "MLLMs have demonstrated remarkable comprehension and reasoning capabilities\nwith complex language and visual data. These advances have spurred the vision\nof establishing a generalist robotic MLLM proficient in understanding complex\nhuman instructions and accomplishing various embodied tasks. However,\ndeveloping MLLMs for real-world robots is challenging due to the typically\nlimited computation and memory capacities available on robotic platforms. In\ncontrast, the inference of MLLMs involves storing billions of parameters and\nperforming tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands. In\nour paper, we propose a Dynamic Early-Exit Framework for Robotic\nVision-Language-Action Model (DeeR-VLA, or simply DeeR) that automatically\nadjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The\napproach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model\nto terminate processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for\na specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation.\nAdditionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination\ncriteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average\ncomputational cost (i.e., power consumption), as well as peak computational\nconsumption (i.e., latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure\nthat DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while\nmaintaining competitive performance. On the CALVIN robot manipulation\nbenchmark, DeeR demonstrates significant reductions in computational costs of\nLLM by 5.2-6.5x and GPU memory of LLM by 2-6x without compromising performance.\nCode and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/yueyang130/DeeR-VLA.",

To investigate this, we had\nchildren, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies (e.g., a b\n: a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain (Greek\nalphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols).

We propose multiview-temporal modules,\nwhich disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D\nand 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a\nvariety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera\ntrajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D\nrepresentations.

Furthermore, we introduce a\nnovel methodology for representing street networks in knowledge graphs,\ndiverging from the conventional practice of individually capturing each street\nsegment.

We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement\nLearning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage.\nIn our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of \"feedback gaming\" such as\nmanipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users\nare vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target\nthem while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors\nharder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage\ncontinued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter\nproblematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some\nof our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler\nmanipulative behaviors.

The\nreconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by\nthe multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the\ncondition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves\nthe text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to\nsupport both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version\nhas 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D\n1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly\nreducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the\nproduced assets.",

      "abstract": "Neural ODEs (NODEs) are continuous-time neural networks (NNs) that can\nprocess data without the limitation of time intervals. They have advantages in\nlearning and understanding the evolution of complex real dynamics. Many\nprevious works have focused on NODEs in concise forms, while numerous physical\nsystems taking straightforward forms, in fact, belong to their more complex\nquasi-classes, thus appealing to a class of general NODEs with high scalability\nand flexibility to model those systems. This, however, may result in intricate\nnonlinear properties. In this paper, we introduce ControlSynth Neural ODEs\n(CSODEs). We show that despite their highly nonlinear nature, convergence can\nbe guaranteed via tractable linear inequalities. In the composition of CSODEs,\nwe introduce an extra control term for learning the potential simultaneous\ncapture of dynamics at different scales, which could be particularly useful for\npartial differential equation-formulated systems. Finally, we compare several\nrepresentative NNs with CSODEs on important physical dynamics under the\ninductive biases of CSODEs, and illustrate that CSODEs have better learning and\npredictive abilities in these settings.",

However, outsourcing medical\nrecords to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and\nsecurity concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for\ncollaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust\nmodels without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This\nstudy proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography\n(EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables\nmultiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data\nwithout exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression\nproblem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a\nkey indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked\nself-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and\nemploys EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states\nafter a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four\ninstitutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting\nNIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\\approx$ 3.0).\nThis demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and\nexplainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.",

Motivated by this, we propose a method to regularize UID\nmodels towards permutation equivariance, via a contrastive loss.

However, the stochastic nature of ambient energy\nsources often results in insufficient harvesting rates, failing to meet the\nenergy requirements for inference and causing significant performance\ndegradation in energy-agnostic systems. To address this problem, we consider an\non-device adaptive inference system equipped with an energy-harvester and\nfinite-capacity energy storage. We then allow the device to reduce the run-time\nexecution cost on-demand, by either switching between differently-sized neural\nnetworks, referred to as multi-model selection (MMS), or by enabling earlier\npredictions at intermediate layers, called early exiting (EE). The model to be\nemployed, or the exit point is then dynamically chosen based on the energy\nstorage and harvesting process states. We also study the efficacy of\nintegrating the prediction confidence into the decision-making process. We\nderive a principled policy with theoretical guarantees for confidence-aware and\n-agnostic controllers. Moreover, in multi-exit networks, we study the\nadvantages of taking decisions incrementally, exit-by-exit, by designing a\nlightweight reinforcement learning-based controller. Experimental results show\nthat, as the rate of the ambient energy increases, energy- and confidence-aware\ncontrol schemes show approximately 5% improvement in accuracy compared to their\nenergy-aware confidence-agnostic counterparts. Incremental approaches achieve\neven higher accuracy, particularly when the energy storage capacity is limited\nrelative to the energy consumption of the inference model.",

We use this\nmethod for measuring causal effects to develop an improved steering method,\nSAE-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS), which finds steering vectors to target specific\nSAE features while minimizing unintended side effects.

The performance of local\noptimization methods in these settings is sensitive to the initial solution:\npoor initialization can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions. To\naddress this challenge, we propose learning to predict \\emph{multiple} diverse\ninitial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We\nintroduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a\nsingle-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen\nusing a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where\nseveral optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a\ndifferent solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. Notably, by\nincluding a default initialization among predicted ones, the cost of the final\noutput is guaranteed to be equal or lower than with the default initialization.\nWe validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole,\nreacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and\niLQR. We find significant and consistent improvement with our method across all\nevaluation settings and demonstrate that it efficiently scales with the number\nof initial solutions required.

Our investigation is grounded in a massive dataset consisting of 939\nmillion protein sequences. We trained over 300 models ranging from 3.5 million\nto 10.7 billion parameters on 5 to 200 billion unique tokens, to investigate\nthe relations between model sizes, training token numbers, and objectives.\nFirst, we observed the effect of diminishing returns for the Causal Language\nModel (CLM) and that of overfitting for the Masked Language Model~(MLM) when\nrepeating the commonly used Uniref database. To address this, we included\nmetagenomic protein sequences in the training set to increase the diversity and\navoid the plateau or overfitting effects. Second, we obtained the scaling laws\nof CLM and MLM on Transformer, tailored to the specific characteristics of\nprotein sequence data. Third, we observe a transfer scaling phenomenon from CLM\nto MLM, further demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer through scaling\nbehaviors based on estimated Effectively Transferred Tokens.

Deep Learning (DL) models have\ndemonstrated accuracy in reproducing the features of the selected processes.\nHowever, current DL generative models are limited in their ability to adapt the\nlearned distributions to generate data samples based on specific conditions or\nattributes. This limitation is particularly significant because the ability to\ncontrol the type of generated data can be beneficial in various contexts,\nenabling a focus on specific behaviours, exploration of infrequent patterns, or\nsimulation of alternative 'what-if' scenarios. In this work, we address this\nchallenge by introducing a conditional model for process data generation based\non a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Conditional models offer\ncontrol over the generation process by tuning input conditional variables,\nenabling more targeted and controlled data generation. Unlike other domains,\nCVAE for process mining faces specific challenges due to the multiperspective\nnature of the data and the need to adhere to control-flow rules while ensuring\ndata variability. Specifically, we focus on generating process executions\nconditioned on control flow and temporal features of the trace, allowing us to\nproduce traces for specific, identified sub-processes. The generated traces are\nthen evaluated using common metrics for generative model assessment, along with\nadditional metrics to evaluate the quality of the conditional generation",

SAEs generate sparse feature representations\nusing a sparsifying activation function that implicitly defines a set of\ntoken-feature matches. We frame the token-feature matching as a resource\nallocation problem constrained by a total sparsity upper bound. For example,\nTopK SAEs solve this allocation problem with the additional constraint that\neach token matches with at most $k$ features. In TopK SAEs, the $k$ active\nfeatures per token constraint is the same across tokens, despite some tokens\nbeing more difficult to reconstruct than others. To address this limitation, we\npropose two novel SAE variants, Feature Choice SAEs and Mutual Choice SAEs,\nwhich each allow for a variable number of active features per token. Feature\nChoice SAEs solve the sparsity allocation problem under the additional\nconstraint that each feature matches with at most $m$ tokens. Mutual Choice\nSAEs solve the unrestricted allocation problem where the total sparsity budget\ncan be allocated freely between tokens and features. Additionally, we introduce\na new auxiliary loss function, $\\mathtt{aux\\_zipf\\_loss}$, which generalises\nthe $\\mathtt{aux\\_k\\_loss}$ to mitigate dead and underutilised features. Our\nmethods result in SAEs with fewer dead features and improved reconstruction\nloss at equivalent sparsity levels as a result of the inherent adaptive\ncomputation.

While the development of machine learning algorithms for\nthis task has seen significant success, the prevailing approaches, which\npredominantly employ a discriminative formulation, frequently encounter the\nerror accumulation issue and often fail to capture the extensive variety of\nplausible sequences. To fill these gaps, we propose Bridge-IF, a generative\ndiffusion bridge model for inverse folding, which is designed to learn the\nprobabilistic dependency between the distributions of backbone structures and\nprotein sequences. Specifically, we harness an expressive structure encoder to\npropose a discrete, informative prior derived from structures, and establish a\nMarkov bridge to connect this prior with native sequences. During the inference\nstage, Bridge-IF progressively refines the prior sequence, culminating in a\nmore plausible design. Moreover, we introduce a reparameterization perspective\non Markov bridge models, from which we derive a simplified loss function that\nfacilitates more effective training. We also modulate protein language models\n(PLMs) with structural conditions to precisely approximate the Markov bridge\nprocess, thereby significantly enhancing generation performance while\nmaintaining parameter-efficient training. Extensive experiments on\nwell-established benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge-IF predominantly surpasses\nexisting baselines in sequence recovery and excels in the design of plausible\nproteins with high foldability.

Modeling an MRS is a crucial\naspect of designing the proper system architecture, because this model can be\nused to simulate and measure the performance of the proposed architecture.\nHowever, an MRS solution architecture modeling is a very difficult problem, as\nit contains many dependent behaviors that dynamically change due to the current\nstatus of the overall system. In this paper, we introduce a general purpose MRS\ncase study, where the humans initiate requests that are achieved by the\navailable robots. These requests require different plans that use the current\ncapabilities of the available robots. After proposing an architecture that\ndefines the solution components, three steps are followed. First is modeling\nthese components via Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) language. BPMN\nprovides a graphical notation to precisely represent the behaviors of every\ncomponent, which is an essential need to model the solution. Second is to\nsimulate these components behaviors and interaction in form of software agents.\nJava Agent DEvelopment (JADE) middleware has been used to develop and simulate\nthe proposed model. JADE is based on a reactive agent approach, therefore it\ncan dynamically represent the interaction among the solution components.\nFinally is to analyze the performance of the solution by defining a number of\nquantitative measurements, which can be obtained while simulating the system\nmodel in JADE middleware, therefore the solution can be analyzed and compared\nto another architecture.",

For safety assurance applications, especially in early-warning\nscenarios, RTM faults are expected to be detected as early as possible on a\ncontinuous 7x24 basis. However, limited emphasis has been placed on distributed\nmodel inference frameworks that can meet the inference latency and reliability\nrequirements of such mission critical fault diagnosis systems. In this paper,\nan edge-cloud collaborative early-warning system is proposed to enable\nreal-time and downtime-tolerant fault diagnosis of RTMs, providing a new\nparadigm for the deployment of models in safety-critical scenarios. Firstly, a\nmodular fault diagnosis model is designed specifically for distributed\ndeployment, which utilizes a hierarchical architecture consisting of the prior\nknowledge module, subordinate classifiers, and a fusion layer for enhanced\naccuracy and parallelism. Then, a cloud-edge collaborative framework leveraging\npipeline parallelism, namely CEC-PA, is developed to minimize the overhead\nresulting from distributed task execution and context exchange by strategically\npartitioning and offloading model components across cloud and edge.\nAdditionally, an election consensus mechanism is implemented within CEC-PA to\nensure system robustness during coordinator node downtime. Comparative\nexperiments and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed distributed fault diagnosis approach. Our ensemble-based fault\ndiagnosis model achieves a remarkable 97.4% accuracy on a real-world dataset\ncollected by Nanjing Metro in Jiangsu Province, China.

It dynamically constructs a collaborative graph of learners by\niteratively searching for optimal neighbors in a context-aware manner. Using\nthe constructed graph, collaborative information is extracted through node\nrepresentation learning.

      "abstract": "The emergence of models like GPTs, Claude, LLaMA, and Qwen has reshaped AI\napplications, presenting vast new opportunities across industries. Yet, the\nintegration of tabular data remains notably underdeveloped, despite its\nfoundational role in numerous real-world domains.\n  This gap is critical for three main reasons. First, database or data\nwarehouse data integration is essential for advanced applications; second, the\nvast and largely untapped resource of tabular data offers immense potential for\nanalysis; and third, the business intelligence domain specifically demands\nadaptable, precise solutions that many current LLMs may struggle to provide.\n  In response, we introduce TableGPT2, a model rigorously pre-trained and\nfine-tuned with over 593.8K tables and 2.36M high-quality query-table-output\ntuples, a scale of table-related data unprecedented in prior research. This\nextensive training enables TableGPT2 to excel in table-centric tasks while\nmaintaining strong general language and coding abilities.\n  One of TableGPT2's key innovations is its novel table encoder, specifically\ndesigned to capture schema-level and cell-level information. This encoder\nstrengthens the model's ability to handle ambiguous queries, missing column\nnames, and irregular tables commonly encountered in real-world applications.\nSimilar to visual language models, this pioneering approach integrates with the\ndecoder to form a robust large multimodal model.\n  We believe the results are compelling: over 23 benchmarking metrics,\nTableGPT2 achieves an average performance improvement of 35.20% in the 7B model\nand 49.32% in the 72B model over prior benchmark-neutral LLMs, with robust\ngeneral-purpose capabilities intact.",

Recent research leverages\nthe capabilities of LLMs to improve the performance and user modeling aspects\nof recommender systems. These studies primarily focus on utilizing LLMs to\ninterpret textual data in recommendation tasks. However, it's worth noting that\nin ID-based recommendations, textual data is absent, and only ID data is\navailable. The untapped potential of LLMs for ID data within the ID-based\nrecommendation paradigm remains relatively unexplored. To this end, we\nintroduce a pioneering approach called \"LLM for ID-based Recommendation\"\n(LLM4IDRec). This innovative approach integrates the capabilities of LLMs while\nexclusively relying on ID data, thus diverging from the previous reliance on\ntextual data. The basic idea of LLM4IDRec is that by employing LLM to augment\nID data, if augmented ID data can improve recommendation performance, it\ndemonstrates the ability of LLM to interpret ID data effectively, exploring an\ninnovative way for the integration of LLM in ID-based recommendation. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our LLM4IDRec approach using three widely-used\ndatasets. Our results demonstrate a notable improvement in recommendation\nperformance, with our approach consistently outperforming existing methods in\nID-based recommendation by solely augmenting input data.",

We also explore how to improve Chatgpt's direct cognitive\nimpairment prediction capabilities using the best features in our models.\nEvaluation metrics obtained endorse the effectiveness of a mixed approach\ncombining feature extraction with Chatgpt and a specialized Machine Learning\nmodel to detect cognitive decline within free-form conversational dialogues\nwith older adults.

Still, the deployment of these tools in clinics is\nlimited by the very timeconsuming collection of manually expert-annotated data.\nMoreover, most of the state-ofthe-art models have been trained and validated on\nmoderately homogeneous datasets. It is known that deep learning methods are\noften greatly degraded by domain or label shifts and are yet to be built in\nsuch a way as to be robust to unseen data or label distributions. In the\nclinical setting, this problematic is particularly relevant as the deployment\ninstitutions may have different scanners or acquisition protocols than those\nfrom which the data has been collected to train the model. In this work, we\npropose to address these two challenges on the detection of clinically\nsignificant prostate cancer (csPCa) from bi-parametric MRI. We evaluate the\nmethod proposed by (Kervadec et al., 2018), which introduces a size constaint\nloss to produce fine semantic cancer lesions segmentations from weak circle\nscribbles annotations. Performance of the model is based on two public (PI-CAI\nand Prostate158) and one private databases. First, we show that the model\nachieves on-par performance with strong fully supervised baseline models, both\non in-distribution validation data and unseen test images. Second, we observe a\nperformance decrease for both fully supervised and weakly supervised models\nwhen tested on unseen data domains. This confirms the crucial need for\nefficient domain adaptation methods if deep learning models are aimed to be\ndeployed in a clinical environment.

Recent works argue that toddlers develop this ability by mapping\nclose-in-time visual inputs to similar representations while interacting with\nobjects. High acuity vision is only available in the central visual field,\nwhich May explain why toddlers (much like adults) constantly move around their\ngaze during such interactions. It is unclear whether/how much toddlers curate\ntheir visual experience through these eye movements to support their learning\nof object representations. In this work, we explore whether a bio-inspired\nvisual learning model can harness toddlers' gaze behavior during a play session\nto develop view-invariant object recognition. Exploiting head-mounted eye\ntracking during dyadic play, we simulate toddlers' central visual field\nexperience by cropping image regions centered on the gaze location. This visual\nstream feeds time-based self-supervised learning algorithms. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that toddlers' gaze strategy supports the learning of invariant\nobject representations. Our analysis also reveals that the limited size of the\ncentral visual field where acuity is high is crucial for this. We further find\nthat toddlers' visual experience elicits more robust representations compared\nto adults', mostly because toddlers look at objects they hold themselves for\nlonger bouts. Overall, our work reveals how toddlers' gaze behavior supports\nself-supervised learning of view-invariant object recognition.",

Recognizing that new data can act as forces\nstretching, compressing, or twisting the geometric relationships learned by a\nmodel, we explore various mathematical frameworks to quantify this deformation.\nWe investigate measures such as eigenvalue analysis of covariance matrices to\ncapture global shape changes, local density estimation using kernel density\nestimation (KDE), and Kullback-Leibler divergence to identify subtle shifts in\ndata concentration. Additionally, we draw inspiration from continuum mechanics\nby proposing a ''strain tensor'' analogy to capture multi-faceted deformations\nacross different data types.

However, these models often struggle with real-world tasks without\nfine-tuning. As LLMs grow larger and more performant, fine-tuning for\nspecialized tasks becomes increasingly expensive. Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which fine-tune only a subset of model parameters,\noffer a promising solution by reducing the computational costs of tuning LLMs\nwhile maintaining their performance. Existing studies have explored using PEFT\nand LLMs for various code-related tasks and found that the effectiveness of\nPEFT techniques is task-dependent. The application of PEFT techniques in unit\ntest generation remains underexplored. The state-of-the-art is limited to using\nLLMs with full fine-tuning to generate unit tests. This paper investigates both\nfull fine-tuning and various PEFT methods, including LoRA, (IA)^3, and prompt\ntuning, across different model architectures and sizes. We use well-established\nbenchmark datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in unit test generation. Our\nfindings show that PEFT methods can deliver performance comparable to full\nfine-tuning for unit test generation, making specialized fine-tuning more\naccessible and cost-effective.

      "abstract": "Point cloud registration, a fundamental task in 3D vision, has achieved\nremarkable success with learning-based methods in outdoor environments.\nUnsupervised outdoor point cloud registration methods have recently emerged to\ncircumvent the need for costly pose annotations. However, they fail to\nestablish reliable optimization objectives for unsupervised training, either\nrelying on overly strong geometric assumptions, or suffering from poor-quality\npseudo-labels due to inadequate integration of low-level geometric and\nhigh-level contextual information. We have observed that in the feature space,\nlatent new inlier correspondences tend to cluster around respective positive\nanchors that summarize features of existing inliers. Motivated by this\nobservation, we propose a novel unsupervised registration method termed INTEGER\nto incorporate high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label\nmining. Specifically, we propose the Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module\nto dynamically adapt the teacher for each mini-batch of data during training\nand discover reliable pseudo-labels by considering both high-level feature\nrepresentations and low-level geometric cues. Furthermore, we propose\nAnchor-Based Contrastive Learning to facilitate contrastive learning with\nanchors for a robust feature space. Lastly, we introduce a Mixed-Density\nStudent to learn density-invariant features, addressing challenges related to\ndensity variation and low overlap in the outdoor scenario.

      "abstract": "When interacting with each other, humans adjust their behavior based on\nperceived trust. However, to achieve similar adaptability, robots must\naccurately estimate human trust at sufficiently granular timescales during the\nhuman-robot collaboration task. A beta reputation is a popular way to formalize\na mathematical estimation of human trust. However, it relies on binary\nperformance, which updates trust estimations only after each task concludes.\nAdditionally, manually crafting a reward function is the usual method of\nbuilding a performance indicator, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming.\nThese limitations prevent efficiently capturing continuous changes in trust at\nmore granular timescales throughout the collaboration task. Therefore, this\npaper presents a new framework for the estimation of human trust using a beta\nreputation at fine-grained timescales. To achieve granularity in beta\nreputation, we utilize continuous reward values to update trust estimations at\neach timestep of a task. We construct a continuous reward function using\nmaximum entropy optimization to eliminate the need for the laborious\nspecification of a performance indicator. The proposed framework improves trust\nestimations by increasing accuracy, eliminating the need for manually crafting\na reward function, and advancing toward developing more intelligent robots.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) now exhibit near human-level performance in\nvarious tasks, but their performance drops drastically after a handful of\nhigh-resource languages due to the imbalance in pre-training data. Inspired by\nthe human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching\n(the practice of language alternation in a conversation), we propose\ncode-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for\nLLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively\ntraining models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching,\n2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as\nour underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving\nlanguage transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared\nto monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that\nboth token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance\ncross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We\nalso extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese\n(high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models\n(Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious\ncorrelations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a\nrobust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We\nobserve that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality,\nmonolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.",

This task focuses\non accurately retrieving molecule structures based on textual descriptions, by\neffectively aligning textual descriptions and molecules to assist researchers\nin identifying suitable molecular candidates. However, many existing approaches\noverlook the details inherent in molecule sub-structures. In this work, we\nintroduce the Optimal TRansport-based Multi-grained Alignments model (ORMA), a\nnovel approach that facilitates multi-grained alignments between textual\ndescriptions and molecules. Our model features a text encoder and a molecule\nencoder. The text encoder processes textual descriptions to generate both\ntoken-level and sentence-level representations, while molecules are modeled as\nhierarchical heterogeneous graphs, encompassing atom, motif, and molecule nodes\nto extract representations at these three levels. A key innovation in ORMA is\nthe application of Optimal Transport (OT) to align tokens with motifs, creating\nmulti-token representations that integrate multiple token alignments with their\ncorresponding motifs. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning to refine\ncross-modal alignments at three distinct scales: token-atom, multitoken-motif,\nand sentence-molecule, ensuring that the similarities between correctly matched\ntext-molecule pairs are maximized while those of unmatched pairs are minimized.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore alignments at both the\nmotif and multi-token levels.

      "abstract": "Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount\nof manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and\nresource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models\nsuch as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy,\nenabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual\nannotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating\nsingle-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable\nDiffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope\nand diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \\textbf{Free-Mask}\nthat combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing\ncapabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via\ntext-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic\ndatasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate\nsegmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and\nalso ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that\nsynthetic data generated by \\textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to\noutperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings.\nNotably, \\textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously\nunseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.",

      "abstract": "A long-standing goal in robot learning is to develop methods for robots to\nacquire new skills autonomously. While reinforcement learning (RL) comes with\nthe promise of enabling autonomous data collection, it remains challenging to\nscale in the real-world partly due to the significant effort required for\nenvironment design and instrumentation, including the need for designing reset\nfunctions or accurate success detectors. On the other hand, imitation learning\n(IL) methods require little to no environment design effort, but instead\nrequire significant human supervision in the form of collected demonstrations.\nTo address these shortcomings, recent works in autonomous IL start with an\ninitial seed dataset of human demonstrations that an autonomous policy can\nbootstrap from. While autonomous IL approaches come with the promise of\naddressing the challenges of autonomous RL as well as pure IL strategies, in\nthis work, we posit that such techniques do not deliver on this promise and are\nstill unable to scale up autonomous data collection in the real world. Through\na series of real-world experiments, we demonstrate that these approaches, when\nscaled up to realistic settings, face much of the same scaling challenges as\nprior attempts in RL in terms of environment design. Further, we perform a\nrigorous study of autonomous IL methods across different data scales and 7\nsimulation and real-world tasks, and demonstrate that while autonomous data\ncollection can modestly improve performance, simply collecting more human data\noften provides significantly more improvement. Our work suggests a negative\nresult: that scaling up autonomous data collection for learning robot policies\nfor real-world tasks is more challenging and impractical than what is suggested\nin prior work. We hope these insights about the core challenges of scaling up\ndata collection help inform future efforts in autonomous learning.",

At the core of these\ncapabilities is LLMs' proficiency in representing and understanding structural\nor semi-structural data, such as tables and graphs. Numerous studies have\ndemonstrated that reasoning on tabular data or graphs is not only feasible for\nLLMs but also gives a promising research direction which treats these data as\nin-context data. The lightweight and human readable characteristics of\nin-context database can potentially make it an alternative for the traditional\ndatabase in typical RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) settings. However,\nalmost all current work focuses on static in-context data, which does not allow\ndynamic update. In this paper, to enable dynamic database update, delta\nencoding of database is proposed. We explore how data stored in traditional\nRDBMS can be encoded as in-context text and evaluate LLMs' proficiency for CRUD\n(Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on in-context databases.

Despite their proficiency in various tasks, LLMs like PaLM 540B and\nLlama-3.1 405B face limitations due to large parameter sizes and computational\ndemands, often requiring cloud API use which raises privacy concerns, limits\nreal-time applications on edge devices, and increases fine-tuning costs.\nAdditionally, LLMs often underperform in specialized domains such as healthcare\nand law due to insufficient domain-specific knowledge, necessitating\nspecialized models. Therefore, Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly\nfavored for their low inference latency, cost-effectiveness, efficient\ndevelopment, and easy customization and adaptability.

The definition of\nSLMs varies widely, thus to standardize, we propose defining SLMs by their\ncapability to perform specialized tasks and suitability for\nresource-constrained settings, setting boundaries based on the minimal size for\nemergent abilities and the maximum size sustainable under resource constraints.\nFor other aspects, we provide a taxonomy of relevant models/methods and develop\ngeneral frameworks for each category to enhance and utilize SLMs effectively.",

Most prior work in this area has used LLMs to reason through\nsteps from an initial to a goal state or criterion, thereby effectively\nreasoning in a forward direction. Nonetheless, many planning problems exhibit\nan inherent asymmetry such that planning backward from the goal is\nsignificantly easier -- for example, if there are bottlenecks close to the\ngoal. We take inspiration from this observation and demonstrate that this bias\nholds for LLM planning as well: planning performance in one direction\ncorrelates with the planning complexity of the problem in that direction.\nHowever, our experiments also reveal systematic biases which lead to poor\nplanning in the backward direction. With this knowledge, we propose a backward\nplanning algorithm for LLMs that first flips the problem and then plans forward\nin the flipped problem. This helps avoid the backward bias, generate more\ndiverse candidate plans, and exploit asymmetries between the forward and\nbackward directions in planning problems -- we find that combining planning in\nboth directions with self-verification improves the overall planning success\nrates by 4-24% in three planning domains.",

In addition, MetaRec adaptively transfers\nfrom multiple source tasks by rescaling meta gradients based on the\nsource-target domain similarity, enabling selective learning to improve\nrecommendation performance.

      "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that a promising strategy for teaching robots a\nwide range of complex skills is by training them on a curriculum of\nprogressively more challenging environments. However, developing an effective\ncurriculum of environment distributions currently requires significant\nexpertise, which must be repeated for every new domain. Our key insight is that\nenvironments are often naturally represented as code. Thus, we probe whether\neffective environment curriculum design can be achieved and automated via code\ngeneration by large language models (LLM). In this paper, we introduce\nEurekaverse, an unsupervised environment design algorithm that uses LLMs to\nsample progressively more challenging, diverse, and learnable environments for\nskill training. We validate Eurekaverse's effectiveness in the domain of\nquadrupedal parkour learning, in which a quadruped robot must traverse through\na variety of obstacle courses. The automatic curriculum designed by Eurekaverse\nenables gradual learning of complex parkour skills in simulation and can\nsuccessfully transfer to the real-world, outperforming manual training courses\ndesigned by humans.",

It is\nparticularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is\nnot permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias\nlabels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly\nenhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence\nof spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing\nmethod, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which\ndoes not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target\nlabel and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting\nsamples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the\ndisagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing\nbaselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.",

The\nreason current RPAs lack this capability is due to the nature of existing\ncharacter datasets, which lack collections of character quotations and are\nlimited to multi-turn dialogue tasks, constraining the RPA's performance across\nother task domains and failing to mimic a character's linguistic style.

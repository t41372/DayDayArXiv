    "abstract": "Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for ensuring ethical\nand responsible AI use, especially in addressing privacy leak, bias, safety,\nand evolving regulations. Existing approaches to LLM unlearning often rely on\nretain data or a reference LLM, yet they struggle to adequately balance\nunlearning performance with overall model utility. This challenge arises\nbecause leveraging explicit retain data or implicit knowledge of retain data\nfrom a reference LLM to fine-tune the model tends to blur the boundaries\nbetween the forgotten and retain data, as different queries often elicit\nsimilar responses. In this work, we propose eliminating the need to retain data\nor the reference LLM for response calibration in LLM unlearning. Recognizing\nthat directly applying gradient ascent on the forget data often leads to\noptimization instability and poor performance, our method guides the LLM on\nwhat not to respond to, and importantly, how to respond, based on the forget\ndata. Hence, we introduce Forget data only Loss AjustmenT (FLAT), a \"flat\" loss\nadjustment approach which addresses these issues by maximizing f-divergence\nbetween the available template answer and the forget answer only w.r.t. the\nforget data. The variational form of the defined f-divergence theoretically\nprovides a way of loss adjustment by assigning different importance weights for\nthe learning w.r.t. template responses and the forgetting of responses subject\nto unlearning. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach not only\nachieves superior unlearning performance compared to existing methods but also\nminimizes the impact on the model's retained capabilities, ensuring high\nutility across diverse tasks, including copyrighted content unlearning on Harry\nPotter dataset and MUSE Benchmark, and entity unlearning on the TOFU dataset.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in automated formal reasoning is the intractable search\nspace, which grows exponentially with the depth of the proof. This branching is\ncaused by the large number of candidate proof tactics which can be applied to a\ngiven goal. Nonetheless, many of these tactics are semantically similar or lead\nto an execution error, wasting valuable resources in both cases. We address the\nproblem of effectively pruning this search, using only synthetic data generated\nfrom previous proof attempts. We first demonstrate that it is possible to\ngenerate semantically aware tactic representations which capture the effect on\nthe proving environment, likelihood of success and execution time. We then\npropose a novel filtering mechanism which leverages these representations to\nselect semantically diverse and high quality tactics, using Determinantal Point\nProcesses. Our approach, 3D-Prover, is designed to be general, and to augment\nany underlying tactic generator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Prover\non the miniF2F-valid and miniF2F-test benchmarks by augmenting the ReProver\nLLM. We show that our approach leads to an increase in the overall proof rate,\nas well as a significant improvement in the tactic success rate, execution time\nand diversity.",

These risks are primarily reflected in two\nareas: a model potential to generate insecure code (insecure coding) and its\nutility in cyberattacks (cyberattack helpfulness). While these benchmarks have\nmade significant strides, there remain opportunities for further improvement.\nFor instance, many current benchmarks tend to focus more on a model ability to\nprovide attack suggestions rather than its capacity to generate executable\nattacks. Additionally, most benchmarks rely heavily on static evaluation\nmetrics, which may not be as precise as dynamic metrics such as passing test\ncases. Conversely, expert-verified benchmarks, while offering high-quality\ndata, often operate at a smaller scale. To address these gaps, we develop\nSecCodePLT, a unified and comprehensive evaluation platform for code GenAIs'\nrisks. For insecure code, we introduce a new methodology for data creation that\ncombines experts with automatic generation. Our methodology ensures the data\nquality while enabling large-scale generation. We also associate samples with\ntest cases to conduct code-related dynamic evaluation. For cyberattack\nhelpfulness, we set up a real environment and construct samples to prompt a\nmodel to generate actual attacks, along with dynamic metrics in our\nenvironment. We conduct extensive experiments and show that SecCodePLT\noutperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark CyberSecEval in security\nrelevance. Furthermore, it better identifies the security risks of SOTA models\nin insecure coding and cyberattack helpfulness. Finally, we apply SecCodePLT to\nthe SOTA code agent, Cursor, and, for the first time, identify non-trivial\nsecurity risks in this advanced coding agent.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting has surpassed neural radiance field methods in novel\nview synthesis by achieving lower computational costs and real-time\nhigh-quality rendering. Although it produces a high-quality rendering with a\nlot of input views, its performance drops significantly when only a few views\nare available. In this work, we address this by proposing a depth-aware\nGaussian splatting method for few-shot novel view synthesis. We use monocular\ndepth prediction as a prior, along with a scale-invariant depth loss, to\nconstrain the 3D shape under just a few input views. We also model color using\nlower-order spherical harmonics to avoid overfitting. Further, we observe that\nremoving splats with lower opacity periodically, as performed in the original\nwork, leads to a very sparse point cloud and, hence, a lower-quality rendering.\nTo mitigate this, we retain all the splats, leading to a better reconstruction\nin a few view settings. Experimental results show that our method outperforms\nthe traditional 3D Gaussian splatting methods by achieving improvements of\n10.5% in peak signal-to-noise ratio, 6% in structural similarity index, and\n14.1% in perceptual similarity, thereby validating the effectiveness of our\napproach.

    "abstract": "Previous text-to-SQL datasets and systems have primarily focused on user\nquestions with clear intentions that can be answered. However, real user\nquestions can often be ambiguous with multiple interpretations or unanswerable\ndue to a lack of relevant data. In this work, we construct a practical\nconversational text-to-SQL dataset called PRACTIQ, consisting of ambiguous and\nunanswerable questions inspired by real-world user questions. We first\nidentified four categories of ambiguous questions and four categories of\nunanswerable questions by studying existing text-to-SQL datasets. Then, we\ngenerate conversations with four turns: the initial user question, an assistant\nresponse seeking clarification, the user's clarification, and the assistant's\nclarified SQL response with the natural language explanation of the execution\nresults. For some ambiguous queries, we also directly generate helpful SQL\nresponses, that consider multiple aspects of ambiguity, instead of requesting\nuser clarification. To benchmark the performance on ambiguous, unanswerable,\nand answerable questions, we implemented large language model (LLM)-based\nbaselines using various LLMs. Our approach involves two steps: question\ncategory classification and clarification SQL prediction. Our experiments\nreveal that state-of-the-art systems struggle to handle ambiguous and\nunanswerable questions effectively. We will release our code for data\ngeneration and experiments on GitHub.",

Quantifying\ndivergence from neurotypical connectivity patterns offers a promising pathway\nto inform diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. While advanced neuroimaging\ntechniques, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI), have facilitated the mapping of\nbrain's structural connectome, the challenge lies in accurately modeling\ndevelopmental trajectories within these complex networked structures to create\nrobust neurodivergence markers. In this work, we present the Brain\nRepresentation via Individualized Deep Generative Embedding (BRIDGE) framework,\nwhich integrates normative modeling with a bio-inspired deep generative model\nto create a reference trajectory of connectivity transformation as part of\nneurotypical development. This will enable the assessment of neurodivergence by\ncomparing individuals to the established neurotypical trajectory. BRIDGE\nprovides a global neurodivergence score based on the difference between\nconnectivity-based brain age and chronological age, along with region-wise\nneurodivergence maps that highlight localized connectivity differences.\nApplication of BRIDGE to a large cohort of children with autism spectrum\ndisorder demonstrates that the global neurodivergence score correlates with\nclinical assessments in autism, and the regional map offers insights into the\nheterogeneity at the individual level in neurodevelopmental disorders.\nTogether, the neurodivergence score and map form powerful tools for quantifying\ndevelopmental divergence in connectivity patterns, advancing the development of\nimaging markers for personalized diagnosis and intervention in various clinical\ncontexts.",

However, these prompting methods often struggle on natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU) tasks, where encoder-only models like BERT-base\noutperform LLMs on benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE. This paper explores two\napproaches-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO)-to enhance LLMs' NLU abilities. To reduce the cost of full-model\nfine-tuning, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers, limiting updates\nto these layers during both SFT and PPO. In SFT, task-specific prompts are\nconcatenated with input queries and ground-truth labels, optimizing with\nnext-token prediction. Despite this, LLMs still underperform compared to models\nlike BERT-base on several NLU tasks. To close this gap, we apply PPO, a\nreinforcement learning technique that treats each token generation as an action\nand uses a reward function based on alignment with ground-truth answers. PPO\nthen updates the model to maximize these rewards, aligning outputs with correct\nlabels. Our experiments with LLAMA2-7B show that PPO improves performance, with\na 6.3-point gain over SFT on GLUE. PPO exceeds zero-shot by 38.7 points and\nfew-shot by 26.1 points on GLUE, while surpassing these by 28.8 and 28.5 points\non SuperGLUE.

    "abstract": "While large language models have shown impressive capabilities across a wide\nrange of domains, they still encounter significant challenges in reasoning\ntasks that require gathering evidence over multiple turns and drawing logical\nconclusions. These challenges present significant obstacles for LLM chat user\ninterfaces, which rely on multi-turn interactions to facilitate effective\ncollaboration. This limitation leads to real-world issues; for example, service\nchatbots must gather necessary information from customers over multiple turns\nto diagnose and resolve problems effectively. Despite the multi-turn nature of\nmany real-world LLM use cases, most existing benchmarks rely on carefully\ncurated single-turn tests, which often blur the line between memorization and\ngenuine reasoning. To address this, we introduce the Wason Inductive Logic Test\n(WILT), a simple yet challenging multi-turn reasoning benchmark designed to\nresist memorization. WILT is inspired by the Wason 2-4-6 task, where\nparticipants must infer a boolean function involving three variables (e.g., $x\n< y < z$) by proposing test cases (such as $(2, 4, 6)$). In WILT, each test\nstarts from a clean slate, with only the initial instructions provided,\npreventing models from relying on pre-learned responses. Over several turns,\nmodels must interact with the environment by suggesting test cases to narrow\nthe possible hypotheses and ultimately infer the hidden function based on the\noutcomes. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with this task, exhibiting\ndistinct strengths and weaknesses: some are better at narrowing down the\nhypothesis space by proposing valuable test cases, while others are more adept\nat deducing the hidden function from observed cases. Despite these variations,\nthe best-performing model achieves only 28% accuracy, highlighting a\nsignificant gap in LLM performance on complex multi-turn reasoning tasks.",

Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal\nannotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks\nand are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding.

As a result, our benchmark\nprovides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and\nreasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order,\netc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question\nanswering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as\ndifferent models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation\nmodels. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only\n38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant\ngap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding.

Most previous video generation models are trained on\nshort video clips, while recently there has been increasing interest in\ntraining long video generation models directly on longer videos. However, the\nlack of such high-quality long videos impedes the advancement of long video\ngeneration. To promote research in long video generation, we desire a new\ndataset with four key features essential for training long video generation\nmodels: (1) long videos covering at least 10 seconds, (2) long-take videos\nwithout cuts, (3) large motion and diverse contents, and (4) temporally dense\ncaptions. To achieve this, we introduce a new pipeline for selecting\nhigh-quality long-take videos and generating temporally dense captions.\nSpecifically, we define a set of metrics to quantitatively assess video quality\nincluding scene cuts, dynamic degrees, and semantic-level quality, enabling us\nto filter high-quality long-take videos from a large amount of source videos.\nSubsequently, we develop a hierarchical video captioning pipeline to annotate\nlong videos with temporally-dense captions. With this pipeline, we curate the\nfirst long-take video dataset, LVD-2M, comprising 2 million long-take videos,\neach covering more than 10 seconds and annotated with temporally dense\ncaptions. We further validate the effectiveness of LVD-2M by fine-tuning video\ngeneration models to generate long videos with dynamic motions.

    "abstract": "Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships\ninto machine learning models has gained significant attention, as it enhances\ngeneralization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most\nexisting approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through\nregularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction--an\nessential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand,\nimposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational\npower, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a\npractical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy\nhard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that\nmodify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with\nhard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our\nknowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to\nenforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows\nunconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms\nby appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's\noutput. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains the universal approximation\ncapabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and\neffectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise\nconstraints, learning optimization solvers, optimizing control policies in\nsafety-critical systems, and learning safe decision logic for aircraft systems.",

This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we\nfind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention\nscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value\ncomputation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems\nfrom tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax\nnormalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Diffusion Terrain Generator\n(ADTG), a novel method that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models\nto dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and\ncomplex terrains adaptive to the current policy. ADTG guides the diffusion\nmodel's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending\nnoise-corrupted terrains from existing training environments weighted by the\npolicy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the\nnoise corruption level, ADTG seamlessly transitions between generating similar\nterrains for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity.\nOur experiments show that the policy trained by ADTG outperforms both\nprocedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation\nmethods.",

With the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across\nvarious natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been growing\ninterest in integrating LLMs for graph learning.

Existing approaches address this challenge through two strategies: the\nchain of tasks approach, which uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the\ngraph structure so that LLMs are relieved from understanding spatial positions;\nand Graph-to-Text Conversion, which translates graph structures into semantic\ntext representations that LLMs can process.

However, LLMs\noften encounter difficulties in certain aspects of mathematical reasoning,\nleading to flawed reasoning and erroneous results. To mitigate these issues, we\nintroduce a novel mechanism, the Chain of Self-Correction (CoSC), specifically\ndesigned to embed self-correction as an inherent ability in LLMs, enabling them\nto validate and rectify their own results. The CoSC mechanism operates through\na sequence of self-correction stages. In each stage, the LLMs generate a\nprogram to address a given problem, execute this program using program-based\ntools to obtain an output, subsequently verify this output. Based on the\nverification, the LLMs either proceed to the next correction stage or finalize\nthe answer. This iterative self-correction process allows the LLMs to refine\nits reasoning steps and improve the accuracy of its mathematical reasoning. We\nimplement CoSC using a two-phase fine-tuning approach. First, LLMs are trained\nwith a relatively small volume of seeding data generated from GPT-4. Then, we\nenhance CoSC by training with a larger volume of self-generated data, without\nrelying on GPT-4.

The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the\ntraffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the\nresults of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12\nhours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error\n(MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles.\nAfter simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found\nthat the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per\nminute) is 50\\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per\nminute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5\nseconds per vehicle) is 70\\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per\nvehicle).

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits with\nsemi-bandit feedback and a cardinality constraint on the super-arm size.\nExisting algorithms for solving this problem typically involve two key\nsub-routines: (1) a parameter estimation routine that sequentially estimates a\nset of base-arm parameters, and (2) a super-arm selection policy for selecting\na subset of base arms deemed optimal based on these parameters.\nState-of-the-art algorithms assume access to an exact oracle for super-arm\nselection with unbounded computational power. At each instance, this oracle\nevaluates a list of score functions, the number of which grows as low as\nlinearly and as high as exponentially with the number of arms. This can be\nprohibitive in the regime of a large number of arms. This paper introduces a\nnovel realistic alternative to the perfect oracle. This algorithm uses a\ncombination of group-testing for selecting the super arms and quantized\nThompson sampling for parameter estimation. Under a general separability\nassumption on the reward function, the proposed algorithm reduces the\ncomplexity of the super-arm-selection oracle to be logarithmic in the number of\nbase arms while achieving the same regret order as the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms that use exact oracles. This translates to at least an exponential\nreduction in complexity compared to the oracle-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents achieve state-of-the-art performance in a\nwide range of simulated control tasks. However, successful applications to\nreal-world problems remain limited. One reason for this dichotomy is because\nthe learnt policies are not robust to observation noise or adversarial attacks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the robustness of deep RL policies to a single\nsmall state perturbation in deterministic continuous control tasks. We\ndemonstrate that RL policies can be deterministically chaotic, as small\nperturbations to the system state have a large impact on subsequent state and\nreward trajectories. This unstable non-linear behaviour has two consequences:\nfirst, inaccuracies in sensor readings, or adversarial attacks, can cause\nsignificant performance degradation; second, even policies that show robust\nperformance in terms of rewards may have unpredictable behaviour in practice.\nThese two facets of chaos in RL policies drastically restrict the application\nof deep RL to real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose an\nimprovement on the successful Dreamer V3 architecture, implementing Maximal\nLyapunov Exponent regularisation. This new approach reduces the chaotic state\ndynamics, rendering the learnt policies more resilient to sensor noise or\nadversarial attacks and thereby improving the suitability of deep reinforcement\nlearning for real-world applications.",

This redundancy greatly limits the efficient deployment\nof continually adaptable multimodal large language models, hindering their\nability to refine existing skills and acquire new competencies over time. We\nreframe the problem of lifelong Instruction Tuning (LiIT) via data selection,\nwhere the model automatically selects beneficial samples to learn from earlier\nand new datasets based on the current state of acquired knowledge in the model.\nWe propose Adapt-$\\infty$, a new multi-way and adaptive data selection approach\nthat dynamically balances sample efficiency and effectiveness during LiIT. We\nfirst construct pseudo-skill clusters by grouping gradient-based sample\nvectors. Next, we select the best-performing data selector for each skill\ncluster from a pool of selector experts, including our newly proposed scoring\nfunction, Image Grounding score. This data selector samples a subset of the\nmost important samples from each skill cluster for training. To prevent the\ncontinuous increase in the size of the dataset pool during LiIT, we introduce a\ncluster-wise permanent data pruning strategy to remove the most semantically\nredundant samples from each cluster, keeping computational requirements\nmanageable. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of Adapt-$\\infty$ over\na sequence of multimodal instruction tuning datasets with various tasks,\nincluding (Knowledge) VQA, multilingual, grounding, reasoning, language-only,\nand multi-image comprehension. Training with samples selected by Adapt-$\\infty$\nalleviates catastrophic forgetting, especially for rare tasks, and promotes\nforward transfer across the continuum using only a fraction of the original\ndata.",

Data acquisition is then\noptimized by reducing uncertainty on some property of interest maximally, and\non average. In the context of exploration, very few, sometimes no data at all,\nis available prior to data acquisition planning. The prior model therefore\nneeds to include human interpretations on the nature of spatial variability, or\non analogue data deemed relevant for the area being explored. In mineral\nexploration, for example, humans may rely on conceptual models on the genesis\nof the mineralization to define multiple hypotheses, each representing a\nspecific spatial variability of mineralization. More often than not, after the\ndata is acquired, all of the stated hypotheses may be proven incorrect, i.e.\nfalsified, hence prior hypotheses need to be revised, or additional hypotheses\ngenerated. Planning data acquisition under wrong geological priors is likely to\nbe inefficient since the estimated uncertainty on the target property is\nincorrect, hence uncertainty may not be reduced at all. In this paper, we\ndevelop an intelligent agent based on partially observable Markov decision\nprocesses that plans optimally in the case of multiple geological or\ngeoscientific hypotheses on the nature of spatial variability. Additionally,\nthe artificial intelligence is equipped with a method that allows detecting,\nearly on, whether the human stated hypotheses are incorrect, thereby saving\nconsiderable expense in data acquisition.

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning helps improve pretrained large language models (LLMs) in\nterms of the responsiveness to human instructions, which is benefited from\ndiversified instruction data. Federated learning extends the sources of\ninstruction data by exploiting the diversified client-side data, making it\nincreasingly popular for tuning LLMs. Existing approaches of federated LLM\ntuning typically traverse all local data during local training, bringing\nexcessive computation overhead and posing a risk of overfitting local data.\nThus, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which consumes\nrelatively little data from the entire dataset, is needed. In response, this\nwork introduces an approach of federated data-efficient instruction tuning for\nLLMs, FedHDS, which utilizes a representative subset of edge-side data,\ncoreset, to tune the LLM. It reduces the redundancy of data samples at both\nintra-client and inter-client levels through a hierarchical data selection\nframework performed by jointly selecting a small number of representative data\nsamples for local training without sharing the raw data. Extensive experiments\nconducted across six scenarios with various LLMs, datasets and data partitions\ndemonstrate that FedHDS significantly reduces the amount of data required for\nfine-tuning while improving the responsiveness of the instruction-tuned LLMs to\nunseen tasks.",

However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it\nimpossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play\ncrucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we\nintroduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the\ndocument to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an\nimage and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to\ntraditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of\nthe data information in the original documents, eliminating the information\nloss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and\nsynthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of\ngeneration methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional\nRAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 20--40% end-to-end\nperformance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further analysis\nreveals that VisRAG is efficient in utilizing training data and demonstrates\nstrong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising solution for\nRAG on multi-modality documents.

Many models of concept formation\nfocus on a subset of these characteristics, but none account for all of them.\nIn this paper, we present TRESTLE, an incremental account of probabilistic\nconcept formation in structured domains that unifies prior concept learning\nmodels. TRESTLE works by creating a hierarchical categorization tree that can\nbe used to predict missing attribute values and cluster sets of examples into\nconceptually meaningful groups. It updates its knowledge by partially matching\nnovel structures and sorting them into its categorization tree. Finally, the\nsystem supports mixed-data representations, including nominal, numeric,\nrelational, and component attributes. We evaluate TRESTLE's performance on a\nsupervised learning task and an unsupervised clustering task. For both tasks,\nwe compare it to a nonincremental model and to human participants. We find that\nthis new categorization model is competitive with the nonincremental approach\nand more closely approximates human behavior on both tasks. These results serve\nas an initial demonstration of TRESTLE's capabilities and show that, by taking\nkey characteristics of human learning into account, it can better model\nbehavior than approaches that ignore them.",

For this reason, standard\nn-gram-based MT evaluation metrics such as the BLEU score are not appropriate\nfor code-mixed evaluation. To demonstrate this, we propose a novel method for\ncode-mixed text generation: Controlled Generation, which parameterizes the\ncode-mixing degree (CMD) and enables the generation of multiple semantically\nequivalent code-mixed sentences from a given English sentence. We introduce a\nrobust new evaluation metric: GAME: A Gold-Standard Agnostic Measure for\nEvaluation of Code-Mixed Sentences. GAME is both language-agnostic and\ngold-standard-agnostic, i.e. unlike other metrics, GAME does not require\ngold-standard code-mixed sentences for evaluation, thus eliminating the need\nfor human annotators in the code-mixed evaluation process. When used to\nevaluate semantically equivalent code-mixed sentences, we find that GAME scores\nhave a lower standard deviation than BLEU scores.

    "abstract": "Purpose: We introduce a novel methodology for voice pathology detection using\nthe publicly available Saarbr\\\"ucken Voice Database (SVD) and a robust feature\nset combining commonly used acoustic handcrafted features with two novel ones:\npitch difference (relative variation in fundamental frequency) and NaN feature\n(failed fundamental frequency estimation).\n  Methods: We evaluate six machine learning (ML) algorithms -- support vector\nmachine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and\nAdaBoost -- using grid search for feasible hyperparameters and 20480 different\nfeature subsets. Top 1000 classification models -- feature subset combinations\nfor each ML algorithm are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation.\nTo address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training\ndata.\n  Results: Our approach achieves 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average\nrecall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectively. We\nintentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced\ndata.\n  Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that by following the proposed methodology\nand feature engineering, there is a potential in detection of various voice\npathologies using ML models applied to the simplest vocal task, a sustained\nutterance of the vowel /a:/. To enable easier use of our methodology and to\nsupport our claims, we provide a publicly available GitHub repository with DOI\n10.5281/zenodo.13771573.

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban\nintelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task\nby assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However,\ngiven that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced\ndata distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to\nnew urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling\ninterdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this\nend, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task\nSpatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban\nintelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from\nsingle-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning.\nSpecifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction\nnetwork (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main\nobservations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects\nto be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and\npersonalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation\ntraining scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by\nconstructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses\ncorrelated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We\nfurther establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal\nlearning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive\nevaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot\nstreaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.\nCode is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been highly effective in learning from\nand adapting to RF environments and thus detecting and mitigating jamming\neffects to facilitate reliable wireless communications. However, traditional\nDRL methods are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting (namely forgetting old\ntasks when learning new ones), especially in dynamic wireless environments\nwhere jammer patterns change over time. This paper considers an anti-jamming\nsystem and addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in DRL applied to\njammer detection and mitigation. First, we demonstrate the impact of\ncatastrophic forgetting in DRL when applied to jammer detection and mitigation\ntasks, where the network forgets previously learned jammer patterns while\nadapting to new ones. This catastrophic interference undermines the\neffectiveness of the system, particularly in scenarios where the environment is\nnon-stationary. We present a method that enables the network to retain\nknowledge of old jammer patterns while learning to handle new ones. Our\napproach substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting, allowing the\nanti-jamming system to learn new tasks without compromising its ability to\nperform previously learned tasks effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a\nsystematic methodology for sequentially learning tasks in the anti-jamming\nframework. By leveraging continual DRL techniques based on PackNet, we achieve\nsuperior anti-jamming performance compared to standard DRL methods. Our\nproposed approach not only addresses catastrophic forgetting but also enhances\nthe adaptability and robustness of the system in dynamic jamming environments.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our method in preserving knowledge of past\njammer patterns, learning new tasks efficiently, and achieving superior\nanti-jamming performance compared to traditional DRL approaches.",

Parameter-efficient modules like\nadapters and prompts present a promising way to alleviate catastrophic\nforgetting. However, existing works usually learn individual adapters for each\ntask, which may result in redundant knowledge among adapters. Moreover, they\ncontinue to use the original pre-trained model to initialize the downstream\nmodel, leading to negligible changes in the model's generalization compared to\nthe original model. In addition, there is still a lack of research\ninvestigating the consequences of integrating a multi-modal model into the\nupdating procedure for both uni-modal and multi-modal tasks and the subsequent\nimpacts it has on downstream tasks.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is proficient for\ncontinual learning. It expands the distribution of representation upstream\nwhile also minimizing the negative impact of forgetting previous tasks.\nAdditionally, it enhances the generalization capability for downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, we incorporate both multi-modal and uni-modal tasks into upstream\ncontinual learning.

Extensive quantitative evaluation on five financial datasets\ndemonstrates that TABCF does not exhibit bias toward specific feature types,\nand outperforms existing methods in producing effective CFs that align with\ncommon CF desiderata.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining\nhigh-performance policies. However, the safety of these policies has been a\nlong-standing issue. One promising paradigm to guarantee safety is a shield,\nwhich shields a policy from making unsafe actions. However, computing a shield\nscales exponentially in the number of state variables. This is a particular\nconcern in multi-agent systems with many agents. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach for multi-agent shielding. We address scalability by computing\nindividual shields for each agent. The challenge is that typical safety\nspecifications are global properties, but the shields of individual agents only\nensure local properties. Our key to overcome this challenge is to apply\nassume-guarantee reasoning. Specifically, we present a sound proof rule that\ndecomposes a (global, complex) safety specification into (local, simple)\nobligations for the shields of the individual agents. Moreover, we show that\napplying the shields during reinforcement learning significantly improves the\nquality of the policies obtained for a given training budget. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and scalability of our multi-agent shielding framework in two\ncase studies, reducing the computation time from hours to seconds and achieving\nfast learning convergence.",

Previous work trivially fitting the data without\nrevealing the relation between instruction and low-level executable actions,\nthese models are prone to memorizing the surficial pattern of the data instead\nof acquiring the transferable knowledge, and thus are fragile to dynamic\nenvironment changes. To address this issue, we propose a PrIrmitive-driVen\nwaypOinT-aware world model for Robotic manipulation (PIVOT-R) that focuses\nsolely on the prediction of task-relevant waypoints. Specifically, PIVOT-R\nconsists of a Waypoint-aware World Model (WAWM) and a lightweight action\nprediction module. The former performs primitive action parsing and\nprimitive-driven waypoint prediction, while the latter focuses on decoding\nlow-level actions. Additionally, we also design an asynchronous hierarchical\nexecutor (AHE), which can use different execution frequencies for different\nmodules of the model, thereby helping the model reduce computational redundancy\nand improve model execution efficiency. Our PIVOT-R outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source models on the SeaWave benchmark, achieving\nan average relative improvement of 19.45% across four levels of instruction\ntasks. Moreover, compared to the synchronously executed PIVOT-R, the execution\nefficiency of PIVOT-R with AHE is increased by 28-fold, with only a 2.9% drop\nin performance. These results provide compelling evidence that our PIVOT-R can\nsignificantly improve both the performance and efficiency of robotic\nmanipulation.",

Humor is a culturally nuanced aspect of human language, presenting\nchallenges for its understanding and generation. Humor generation necessitates\na multi-hop reasoning process, with each hop founded on proper rationales.\nAlthough many studies, such as those related to GPT-o1, focus on logical\nreasoning with reflection and correction, they still fall short in humor\ngeneration. Due to the sparsity of the knowledge graph in creative thinking, it\nis arduous to achieve multi-hop reasoning. Consequently, in this paper, we\npropose a more robust framework for addressing the humor reasoning task, named\nLoL. LoL aims to inject external information to mitigate the sparsity of the\nknowledge graph, thereby enabling multi-hop reasoning. In the first stage of\nLoL, we put forward an automatic instruction-evolution method to incorporate\nthe deeper and broader thinking processes underlying humor. Judgment-oriented\ninstructions are devised to enhance the model's judgment capability,\ndynamically supplementing and updating the sparse knowledge graph.\nSubsequently, through reinforcement learning, the reasoning logic for each\nonline-generated response is extracted using GPT-4o. In this process, external\nknowledge is re-introduced to aid the model in logical reasoning and the\nlearning of human preferences. Finally, experimental results indicate that the\ncombination of these two processes can enhance both the model's judgment\nability and its generative capacity.

However, most existing GCL methods focus mainly on the time domain\n(low-frequency information) for node feature representations and cannot make\ngood use of high-frequency information to speed up model convergence.\nFurthermore, existing GCL paradigms optimize graph embedding representations by\npulling the distance between positive sample pairs closer and pushing the\ndistance between positive and negative sample pairs farther away, but our\ntheoretical analysis shows that graph contrastive learning benefits from\npushing negative pairs farther away rather than pulling positive pairs closer.\nTo solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel spectral GCL\nframework without positive samples, named SpeGCL. Specifically, to solve the\nproblem that existing GCL methods cannot utilize high-frequency information,\nSpeGCL uses a Fourier transform to extract high-frequency and low-frequency\ninformation of node features, and constructs a contrastive learning mechanism\nin a Fourier space to obtain better node feature representation. Furthermore,\nSpeGCL relies entirely on negative samples to refine the graph embedding. We\nalso provide a theoretical justification for the efficacy of using only\nnegative samples in SpeGCL. Extensive experiments on un-supervised learning,\ntransfer learning, and semi-supervised learning have validated the superiority\nof our SpeGCL framework over the state-of-the-art GCL methods.",

While traditional CNN-based methods have\nimproved detection accuracy, they often suffer from high computational\ncomplexity and large parameter counts, limiting their use in\nresource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a\nLightweight remote sensing Change Detection Network (LCD-Net in short) that\nreduces model size and computational cost while maintaining high detection\nperformance. LCD-Net employs MobileNetV2 as the encoder to efficiently extract\nfeatures from bitemporal images.

Additionally, the Feature Fusion Module (FFM) aggregates\nmultiscale features to better capture subtle changes while suppressing\nbackground noise. The Gated Mechanism Module (GMM) in the decoder further\nenhances feature learning by dynamically adjusting channel weights, emphasizing\nkey change regions. Experiments on LEVIR-CD+, SYSU, and S2Looking datasets show\nthat LCD-Net achieves competitive performance with just 2.56M parameters and\n4.45G FLOPs, making it well-suited for real-time applications in\nresource-limited settings.

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges:\n(i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain\nzero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data\nand model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the\ndevelopment of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this\nwork, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by\nlearning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot\ntransferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining\nmethod. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair\ndata with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary\npretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph\nfoundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For\nfew-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned\nwith our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize\nlearning costs.

We base these steps on two\nfindings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with\nclosely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear\nattentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss\n(\"attention transfer\"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors\nand recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs\nsignificantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and\nscalability. We significantly reduce the linearizing quality gap and produce\nstate-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading\nto 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with\nonly 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens.\nFinally, we apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x\nlarger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same\ncompute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing\nthe gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8%\nand 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU.",

Our proposed lrGAE not only facilitates a deeper\nunderstanding of GAEs but also sets a new benchmark for GAEs across diverse\ngraph-based learning tasks.

RL determines the optimal control\nstrategies in order to maximize the cumulative reward, which reflects the\noverall control goals. However, translating sparse and delayed control goals in\nreal-world tasks into dense and real-time rewards for RL is challenging,\nnormally requiring extensive manual trial-and-error. In view of this, this\nstudy introduces an automatic reward generation paradigm by leveraging the\nin-context learning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).\nThis new paradigm, termed the LLM-enhanced RL, comprises several LLM-based\nmodules: reward initializer, reward modifier, performance analyzer, and reward\nrefiner.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the safety mechanisms of instruction fine-tuned\nlarge language models (LLMs). We discover that re-weighting MLP neurons can\nsignificantly compromise a model's safety, especially for MLPs in\nend-of-sentence inferences. We hypothesize that LLMs evaluate the harmfulness\nof prompts during end-of-sentence inferences, and MLP layers plays a critical\nrole in this process. Based on this hypothesis, we develop 2 novel white-box\njailbreak methods: a prompt-specific method and a prompt-general method. The\nprompt-specific method targets individual prompts and optimizes the attack on\nthe fly, while the prompt-general method is pre-trained offline and can\ngeneralize to unseen harmful prompts. Our methods demonstrate robust\nperformance across 7 popular open-source LLMs, size ranging from 2B to 72B.\nFurthermore, our study provides insights into vulnerabilities of\ninstruction-tuned LLM's safety and deepens the understanding of the internal\nmechanisms of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions is\ncrucial for their utility, honesty, and safety. Reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it\nfaces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability. Recent\nmethods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference\nOptimization (SimPO) have proposed offline alternatives to RLHF, simplifying\nthe process by reparameterizing the reward function. However, DPO depends on a\npotentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed\ntarget reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings.\nIn this work, we propose $\\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization\nalgorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward\nmargin. Specifically, $\\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution,\nbalancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized\nreward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\\alpha$-DPO,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its\nability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control.\nEmpirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\\alpha$-DPO\nconsistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings,\nestablishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves\nsignificant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful\ntool for LLM alignment.

However, the\nlearnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open\nquestion. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time\nlearnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for\nsingle-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention\nmay be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a\nconsequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted\ninto the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded\nfeature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded\nlinear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently\nidentify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is\nequivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated\nthe data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize\nacross all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via\nlinear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative\nmemories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with\npolynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our\ntheoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks,\nkey--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata.

Due to the high demands of\nacquisition device, collection of HR images with their annotations is always\nimpractical in clinical scenarios. Consequently, segmentation results based on\nlow-resolution (LR) images with large slice thickness are often unsatisfactory\nfor subsequent tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Resource-Efficient\nHigh-Resolution Segmentation framework (REHRSeg) to address the above-mentioned\nchallenges in real-world applications, which can achieve HR segmentation while\nonly employing the LR images as input. REHRSeg is designed to leverage\nself-supervised super-resolution (self-SR) to provide pseudo supervision,\ntherefore the relatively easier-to-acquire LR annotated images generated by 2D\nscanning protocols can be directly used for model training. The main\ncontribution to ensure the effectiveness in self-SR for enhancing segmentation\nis three-fold: (1) We mitigate the data scarcity problem in the medical field\nby using pseudo-data for training the segmentation model. (2) We design an\nuncertainty-aware super-resolution (UASR) head in self-SR to raise the\nawareness of segmentation uncertainty as commonly appeared on the ROI\nboundaries. (3) We align the spatial features for self-SR and segmentation\nthrough structural knowledge distillation to enable a better capture of region\ncorrelations. Experimental results demonstrate that REHRSeg achieves\nhigh-quality HR segmentation without intensive supervision, while also\nsignificantly improving the baseline performance for LR segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used in graph-based\napplications, such as social networks and recommendation systems. Nevertheless,\nlarge-scale graphs or deep aggregation layers in full-batch GCNs consume\nsignificant GPU memory, causing out of memory (OOM) errors on mainstream GPUs\n(e.g., 29GB memory consumption on the Ogbnproducts graph with 5 layers). The\nsubgraph sampling methods reduce memory consumption to achieve lightweight GCNs\nby partitioning the graph into multiple subgraphs and sequentially training\nGCNs on each subgraph. However, these methods yield gaps among subgraphs, i.e.,\nGCNs can only be trained based on subgraphs instead of global graph\ninformation, which reduces the accuracy of GCNs. In this paper, we propose\nPromptGCN, a novel prompt-based lightweight GCN model to bridge the gaps among\nsubgraphs. First, the learnable prompt embeddings are designed to obtain global\ninformation. Then, the prompts are attached into each subgraph to transfer the\nglobal information among subgraphs. Extensive experimental results on seven\nlargescale graphs demonstrate that PromptGCN exhibits superior performance\ncompared to baselines.

This paper investigates gender\nbias in LLMs through both mathematical proofs and empirical experiments using\nthe Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), demonstrating that LLMs inherently\nreinforce gender stereotypes even without explicit gender markers. By comparing\nthe decision-making processes of humans and LLMs, we reveal fundamental\ndifferences: while humans can override biases through ethical reasoning and\nindividualized understanding, LLMs maintain bias as a rational outcome of their\nmathematical optimization on biased data. Our analysis proves that bias in LLMs\nis not an unintended flaw but a systematic result of their rational processing,\nwhich tends to preserve and amplify existing societal biases encoded in\ntraining data. Drawing on existentialist theory, we argue that LLM-generated\nbias reflects entrenched societal structures and highlights the limitations of\npurely technical debiasing methods.

Given an image observation and a language instruction,\nprevious work has generated video plans which are then converted to robot\ncontrols to be executed. However, a major bottleneck in leveraging video\ngeneration for control lies in the quality of the generated videos, which often\nsuffer from hallucinatory content and unrealistic physics, resulting in low\ntask success when control actions are extracted from the generated videos.\nWhile scaling up dataset and model size provides a partial solution,\nintegrating external feedback is both natural and essential for grounding video\ngeneration in the real world. With this observation, we propose VideoAgent for\nself-improving generated video plans based on external feedback. Instead of\ndirectly executing the generated video plan, VideoAgent first refines the\ngenerated video plans using a novel procedure which we call self-conditioning\nconsistency, allowing inference-time compute to be turned into better generated\nvideo plans. As the refined video plan is being executed, VideoAgent can\ncollect additional data from the environment to further improve video plan\ngeneration. Experiments in simulated robotic manipulation from MetaWorld and\niTHOR show that VideoAgent drastically reduces hallucination, thereby boosting\nsuccess rate of downstream manipulation tasks. We further illustrate that\nVideoAgent can effectively refine real-robot videos, providing an early\nindicator that robots can be an effective tool in grounding video generation in\nthe physical world.

    "abstract": "Different brain imaging modalities offer unique insights into brain function\nand structure. Combining them enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms.\nPrior multimodal studies fusing functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI)\nhave shown the benefits of this approach. Since sMRI lacks temporal data,\nexisting fusion methods often compress fMRI temporal information into summary\nmeasures, sacrificing rich temporal dynamics. Motivated by the observation that\ncovarying networks are identified in both sMRI and resting-state fMRI, we\ndeveloped a novel fusion method, by combining deep learning frameworks, copulas\nand independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA\n(CLiP-ICA). This method estimates independent sources for each modality and\nlinks the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a copula-based model for more\nflexible integration of temporal and spatial data. We tested CLiP-ICA using\ndata from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results\nshowed that CLiP-ICA effectively captures both strongly and weakly linked sMRI\nand fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive\ncontrol, and default mode networks. It revealed more meaningful components and\nfewer artifacts, addressing the long-standing issue of optimal model order in\nICA. CLiP-ICA also detected complex functional connectivity patterns across\nstages of cognitive decline, with cognitively normal subjects generally showing\nhigher connectivity in sensorimotor and visual networks compared to patients\nwith Alzheimer, along with patterns suggesting potential compensatory\nmechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) emerges as a key feature for Large Language Models\n(LLMs), allowing them to adapt to new tasks by leveraging task-specific\nexamples without updating model parameters. However, ICL faces challenges with\nincreasing numbers of examples due to performance degradation and quadratic\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we propose Logit Arithmetic Reweighting\nApproach (LARA), a novel framework that enhances ICL by using logit-based\nensembling of multiple demonstrations. Our approach divides long input\ndemonstrations into parallelizable shorter inputs to significantly reduce\nmemory requirements, and then effectively aggregate the information by\nreweighting logits of each group via a non-gradient optimization approach. We\nfurther introduce Binary LARA (B-LARA), a variant that constrains weights to\nbinary values to simplify the search space and reduces memory usage by\nfiltering out less informative demonstration groups. Experiments on BBH and\nMMLU demonstrate that LARA and B-LARA outperform all baseline methods in both\naccuracy and memory efficiency. We also conduct extensive analysis to show that\nLARA generalizes well to scenarios of varying numbers of examples from limited\nto many-shot demonstrations.",

In\nsuch settings, robot teammates must react to cues of a human teammate's\ntactical objective to assist in a way that is consistent with the objective\n(e.g., navigating left or right around an obstacle). To address this challenge,\nwe present Dream2Assist, a framework that combines a rich world model able to\ninfer human objectives and value functions, and an assistive agent that\nprovides appropriate expert assistance to a given human teammate. Our approach\nbuilds on a recurrent state space model to explicitly infer human intents,\nenabling the assistive agent to select actions that align with the human and\nenabling a fluid teaming interaction. We demonstrate our approach in a\nhigh-speed racing domain with a population of synthetic human drivers pursuing\nmutually exclusive objectives, such as \"stay-behind\" and \"overtake\". We show\nthat the combined human-robot team, when blending its actions with those of the\nhuman, outperforms the synthetic humans alone as well as several baseline\nassistance strategies, and that intent-conditioning enables adherence to human\npreferences during task execution, leading to improved performance while\nsatisfying the human's objective.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we identify and analyze a recurring training loss pattern,\nwhich we term the \\textit{Epochal Sawtooth Effect (ESE)}, commonly observed\nduring training with adaptive gradient-based optimizers, particularly Adam\noptimizer. This pattern is characterized by a sharp drop in loss at the\nbeginning of each epoch, followed by a gradual increase, resulting in a\nsawtooth-shaped loss curve. Through empirical observations, we demonstrate that\nwhile this effect is most pronounced with Adam, it persists, although less\nseverely, with other optimizers such as RMSProp.\n  We provide an in-depth explanation of the underlying mechanisms that lead to\nthe Epochal Sawtooth Effect. The influences of factors like \\(\\beta\\), batch\nsize, data shuffling on this pattern have been studied. We quantify the\ninfluence of \\(\\beta_2\\) on the shape of the loss curve, showing that higher\nvalues of \\(\\beta_2\\) result in a nearly linear increase in loss, while lower\nvalues create a concave upward trend. Our analysis reveals that this behavior\nstems from the adaptive learning rate controlled by the second moment estimate,\nwith \\(\\beta_1\\) playing a minimal role when \\(\\beta_2\\) is large.\n  To support our analysis, we replicate this phenomenon through a controlled\nquadratic minimization task. By incrementally solving a series of quadratic\noptimization problems using Adam, we demonstrate that the Epochal Sawtooth\nEffect can emerge even in simple optimization scenarios, reinforcing the\ngenerality of this pattern. This paper provides both theoretical insights and\nquantitative analysis, offering a comprehensive understanding of this\nubiquitous phenomenon in modern optimization techniques.",

    "abstract": "Explainability and evaluation of AI models are crucial parts of the security\nof modern intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the network security field, yet\nthey are lacking. Accordingly, feature selection is essential for such parts in\nIDS because it identifies the most paramount features, enhancing attack\ndetection and its description. In this work, we tackle the feature selection\nproblem for IDS by suggesting new ways of applying eXplainable AI (XAI) methods\nfor this problem. We identify the crucial attributes originated by distinct AI\nmethods in tandem with the novel five attribute selection methods. We then\ncompare many state-of-the-art feature selection strategies with our XAI-based\nfeature selection methods, showing that most AI models perform better when\nusing the XAI-based approach proposed in this work. By providing novel feature\nselection techniques and establishing the foundation for several XAI-based\nstrategies, this research aids security analysts in the AI decision-making\nreasoning of IDS by providing them with a better grasp of critical intrusion\ntraits.

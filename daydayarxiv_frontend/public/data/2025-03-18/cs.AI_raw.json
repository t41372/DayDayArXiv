    "abstract": "As deep neural networks(DNN) become increasingly prevalent, particularly in\nhigh-stakes areas such as autonomous driving and healthcare, the ability to\ndetect incorrect predictions of models and intervene accordingly becomes\ncrucial for safety. In this work, we investigate the detection of misclassified\ninputs for image classification models from the lens of adversarial\nperturbation: we propose to use robust radius (a.k.a. input-space margin) as a\nconfidence metric and design two efficient estimation algorithms, RR-BS and\nRR-Fast, for misclassification detection. Furthermore, we design a training\nmethod called Radius Aware Training (RAT) to boost models' ability to identify\nmistakes. Extensive experiments show our method could achieve up to 29.3%\nreduction on AURC and 21.62% reduction in FPR@95TPR, compared with previous\nmethods.",

Deep learning, especially Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs), has advanced SISR. However, increasing network depth\nincreases parameters, and memory usage, and slows training, which is\nproblematic for resource-limited devices. To address this, lightweight models\nare developed to balance accuracy and efficiency. We propose the Involution &\nBSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Network (IBMDN), combining Involution & BSConv\nMulti-Depth Distillation Block (IBMDB) and the Contrast and High-Frequency\nAttention Block (CHFAB). IBMDB integrates Involution and BSConv to balance\ncomputational efficiency and feature extraction. CHFAB enhances high-frequency\ndetails for better visual quality. IBMDB is compatible with other SISR\narchitectures and reduces complexity, improving evaluation metrics like PSNR\nand SSIM. In transformer-based models, IBMDB reduces memory usage while\nimproving feature extraction. In GANs, it enhances perceptual quality,\nbalancing pixel-level accuracy with perceptual details.

In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that\ncan understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions\n(e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought\nreasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI\nreasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To\nrepresent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures\nfundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning,\nwe rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different\nphysical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal\nlarge language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data\nand train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL)\nas the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks\nfor physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies.\nEvaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring\nsignificant improvements.

    "abstract": "Street scene datasets, collected from Street View or dashboard cameras, offer\na promising means of detecting urban objects and incidents like street\nflooding. However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of\nreliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely,\nand ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we\npropose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty.\nFirst, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a\npretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model\non the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate\nlarge training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in\nurban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across\nlocations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation\nzones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs\nprovide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time\nperiods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to\nbaseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external\npredictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to\nimprove urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at\nhigh risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic\nbiases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More\nbroadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations\nrepresents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large\nlabeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing\nthe expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.",

Despite recent advancements,\nwe find that inconsistent--and sometimes flawed--evaluation protocols have been\napplied across studies. This not only impedes the understanding of current\nmethods but also hinders future advancements.\n  To address the issue, this paper introduces DPImageBench for DP image\nsynthesis, with thoughtful design across several dimensions: (1) Methods. We\nstudy eleven prominent methods and systematically characterize each based on\nmodel architecture, pretraining strategy, and privacy mechanism. (2)\nEvaluation. We include nine datasets and seven fidelity and utility metrics to\nthoroughly assess them. Notably, we find that a common practice of selecting\ndownstream classifiers based on the highest accuracy on the sensitive test set\nnot only violates DP but also overestimates the utility scores. DPImageBench\ncorrects for these mistakes. (3) Platform. Despite the methods and evaluation\nprotocols, DPImageBench provides a standardized interface that accommodates\ncurrent and future implementations within a unified framework. With\nDPImageBench, we have several noteworthy findings. For example, contrary to the\ncommon wisdom that pretraining on public image datasets is usually beneficial,\nwe find that the distributional similarity between pretraining and sensitive\nimages significantly impacts the performance of the synthetic images and does\nnot always yield improvements. In addition, adding noise to low-dimensional\nfeatures, such as the high-level characteristics of sensitive images, is less\naffected by the privacy budget compared to adding noise to high-dimensional\nfeatures, like weight gradients. The former methods perform better than the\nlatter under a low privacy budget.",

In this\npaper, we make three fundamental contributions to advancing RAG serving. First,\nwe introduce RAGSchema, a structured abstraction that captures the wide range\nof RAG algorithms, serving as a foundation for performance optimization.\nSecond, we analyze several representative RAG workloads with distinct\nRAGSchema, revealing significant performance variability across these\nworkloads. Third, to address this variability and meet diverse performance\nrequirements, we propose RAGO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Optimizer), a\nsystem optimization framework for efficient RAG serving. Our evaluation shows\nthat RAGO achieves up to a 2x increase in QPS per chip and a 55% reduction in\ntime-to-first-token latency compared to RAG systems built on LLM-system\nextensions.",

    "abstract": "Various Vision Transformer (ViT) models have been widely used for image\nrecognition tasks. However, existing visual explanation methods can not display\nthe attention flow hidden inside the inner structure of ViT models, which\nexplains how the final attention regions are formed inside a ViT for its\ndecision-making. In this paper, a novel visual explanation approach, Dynamic\nAccumulated Attention Map (DAAM), is proposed to provide a tool that can\nvisualize, for the first time, the attention flow from the top to the bottom\nthrough ViT networks. To this end, a novel decomposition module is proposed to\nconstruct and store the spatial feature information by unlocking the [class]\ntoken generated by the self-attention module of each ViT block. The module can\nalso obtain the channel importance coefficients by decomposing the\nclassification score for supervised ViT models. Because of the lack of\nclassification score in self-supervised ViT models, we propose dimension-wise\nimportance weights to compute the channel importance coefficients. Such spatial\nfeatures are linearly combined with the corresponding channel importance\ncoefficients, forming the attention map for each block. The dynamic attention\nflow is revealed by block-wisely accumulating each attention map. The\ncontribution of this work focuses on visualizing the evolution dynamic of the\ndecision-making attention for any intermediate block inside a ViT model by\nproposing a novel decomposition module and dimension-wise importance weights.\nThe quantitative and qualitative analysis consistently validate the\neffectiveness and superior capacity of the proposed DAAM for not only\ninterpreting ViT models with the fully-connected layers as the classifier but\nalso self-supervised ViT models.

The quest to understand human motion has broad\napplications in numerous fields, ranging from computer animation and motion\nsynthesis to neuroscience, human prosthetics and rehabilitation.

Recently, State Space Models (SSM)\nhave shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through\niterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we\npropose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space\nmodel (DEST).

The inter-state\nattention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the\ngated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations.

It is expected that such assistants will be\nneeded to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems\nrequiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific\nscientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science\naccelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to\nsuggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing\nwith a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems,\nthis seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear\nfeasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs\nfor use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements\nexpressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of\n'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM\ncollaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The\npaper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way\nIntelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software\nengineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific\ndata analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by\niStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods\nalong dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c)\nprogramming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to\ndevelop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can\nplay a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.",

    "abstract": "Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to\nfollow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity,\nincompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean\nconversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear\ninstructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that\nintegrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance\ntheory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The\nnormative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation,\nand manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear\ninstructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within\nthis framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to\ncollaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI\ncollaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one\nwithout. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve\nshared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear\nand unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid\nwith Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more\naccurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.\nThis improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's\npragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling\ncontext-aware communication in LLM-based agents.",

Although their linear compute\nscaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over\nTransformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom\nkernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels.\nLeveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs, Flash Linear\nAttention (FLA) shows that linear RNN kernels are faster than Flash Attention,\nby parallelizing over chunks of the input sequence. However, since the chunk\nsize of FLA is limited, many intermediate states must be materialized in GPU\nmemory. This leads to low arithmetic intensity and causes high memory\nconsumption and IO cost, especially for long-context pre-training. In this\nwork, we present Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm\nfor linear RNNs, that enables arbitrary large chunk sizes by introducing an\nadditional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk. First, we apply\nTFLA to the xLSTM with matrix memory, the mLSTM. Second, we propose an mLSTM\nvariant with sigmoid input gate and reduced computation for even faster kernel\nruntimes at equal language modeling performance.

    "abstract": "Social dilemmas pose a significant challenge in the field of multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). Melting Pot is an extensive framework designed\nto evaluate social dilemma environments, providing an evaluation protocol that\nmeasures generalization to new social partners across various test scenarios.\nHowever, running reinforcement learning algorithms in the official Melting Pot\nenvironments demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we\nintroduce SocialJax, a suite of sequential social dilemma environments\nimplemented in JAX. JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library for\nPython that enables significant improvements in the operational efficiency of\nSocialJax on GPUs and TPUs. Our experiments demonstrate that the training\npipeline of SocialJax achieves a 50\\texttimes{} speedup in real-time\nperformance compared to Melting Pot's RLlib baselines. Additionally, we\nvalidate the effectiveness of baseline algorithms within the SocialJax\nenvironments. Finally, we use Schelling diagrams to verify the social dilemma\nproperties of these environments, ensuring they accurately capture the dynamics\nof social dilemmas.",

    "abstract": "Recent video diffusion models have enhanced video editing, but it remains\nchallenging to handle instructional editing and diverse tasks (e.g., adding,\nremoving, changing) within a unified framework. In this paper, we introduce\nVEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple\nend-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and\nreasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and\ntext query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in\ninstructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific\ngrounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders\nthese plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support\ndiverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning\nstrategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale\ninstructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on\nhigh-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data\nsynthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for\nmodel training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality\nvideo editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics.\nVEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different\nediting skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile\nmodel, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in\nvideo object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail.\nWe further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight\npromising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context\nvideo editing.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the biases in Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, a\nstate-of-the-art large language model (LLM) developed by Google, focusing on\ncontent moderation and gender disparities. By comparing its performance to\nChatGPT-4o, examined in a previous work of the author, the analysis highlights\nsome differences in ethical moderation practices. Gemini 2.0 demonstrates\nreduced gender bias, notably with female-specific prompts achieving a\nsubstantial rise in acceptance rates compared to results obtained by\nChatGPT-4o. It adopts a more permissive stance toward sexual content and\nmaintains relatively high acceptance rates for violent prompts, including\ngender-specific cases. Despite these changes, whether they constitute an\nimprovement is debatable. While gender bias has been reduced, this reduction\ncomes at the cost of permitting more violent content toward both males and\nfemales, potentially normalizing violence rather than mitigating harm.\nMale-specific prompts still generally receive higher acceptance rates than\nfemale-specific ones. These findings underscore the complexities of aligning AI\nsystems with ethical standards, highlighting progress in reducing certain\nbiases while raising concerns about the broader implications of the model's\npermissiveness. Ongoing refinements are essential to achieve moderation\npractices that ensure transparency, fairness, and inclusivity without\namplifying harmful content.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in\ngenerating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However,\nthese systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long,\nmulti-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such\nas podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long\nspeech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of\nmost existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous,\noral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing\nworks often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose\nMoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to\nsynthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories,\ntechnical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of\nunseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language\nmodel-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech\ndata. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to\ngenerate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to\nbe as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself.

However, these models do not fully capture the\ncomplexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in\nisolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for\ninfants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a\nSpatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the\ndifferent types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language\nlearning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary\nacquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the\ndifferent types of linguistic relationships that occur during language\nacquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm\nselection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models\nfor predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and\nsemantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with\na 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some\nrelationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in\nidentifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should\nsubsequently learn than others (such as auditory).",

    "abstract": "Studies often aim to reveal how neural representations encode aspects of an\nobserver's environment, such as its contents or structure. These are\n``first-order\" representations (FORs), because they're ``about\" the external\nworld. A less-common target is ``higher-order\" representations (HORs), which\nare ``about\" FORs -- their contents, stability, or uncertainty. HORs of\nuncertainty appear critically involved in adaptive behaviors including learning\nunder uncertainty, influencing learning rates and internal model updating based\non environmental feedback. However, HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be\ndirect ``read-outs\" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting estimation\nprocesses which may be lossy, bias-prone, or distortive and which may also\nincorporate estimates of distributions of uncertainty the observer is likely to\nexperience. While some research has targeted neural representations of\n``instantaneously\" estimated uncertainty, how the brain represents\n\\textit{distributions} of expected uncertainty remains largely unexplored.\nHere, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based generative\nartificial intelligence (genAI) approach to explore neural representations of\nuncertainty distributions. We use existing functional magnetic resonance\nimaging data, where humans learned to `de-noise' their brain states to achieve\ntarget neural patterns, to train denoising diffusion genAI models with RL\nalgorithms to learn noise distributions similar to how humans might learn to do\nthe same. We then explore these models' learned noise-distribution HORs\ncompared to control models trained with traditional backpropagation. Results\nreveal model-dependent differences in noise distribution representations --\nwith the RL-based model offering much higher explanatory power for human\nbehavior -- offering an exciting path towards using genAI to explore neural\nnoise-distribution HORs.",

In this work, we investigate how objectives can\nbe sensibly compared and aggregated to navigate their Pareto front.

    "abstract": "Monitoring forest dynamics at an individual tree scale is essential for\naccurately assessing ecosystem responses to climate change, yet traditional\nmethods relying on field-based forest inventories are labor-intensive and\nlimited in spatial coverage. Advances in remote sensing using drone-acquired\nRGB imagery combined with deep learning models have promised precise individual\ntree crown (ITC) segmentation; however, existing methods are frequently\nvalidated against human-annotated images, lacking rigorous independent ground\ntruth. In this study, we generate high-fidelity validation labels from\nco-located Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data for drone imagery of mixed\nunmanaged boreal and Mediterranean forests. We evaluate the performance of two\nwidely used deep learning ITC segmentation models - DeepForest (RetinaNet) and\nDetectree2 (Mask R-CNN) - on these data, and compare to performance on further\nMediterranean forest data labelled manually. When validated against TLS-derived\nground truth from Mediterranean forests, model performance decreased\nsignificantly compared to assessment based on hand-labelled from an\necologically similar site (AP50: 0.094 vs. 0.670). Restricting evaluation to\nonly canopy trees shrank this gap considerably (Canopy AP50: 0.365), although\nperformance was still far lower than on similar hand-labelled data. Models also\nperformed poorly on boreal forest data (AP50: 0.142), although again increasing\nwhen evaluated on canopy trees only (Canopy AP50: 0.308). Both models showed\nvery poor localisation accuracy at stricter IoU thresholds, even when\nrestricted to canopy trees (Max AP75: 0.051). Similar results have been\nobserved in studies using aerial LiDAR data, suggesting fundamental limitations\nin aerial-based segmentation approaches in closed canopy forests.",

The burgeoning field of intelligent\ntransportation systems, bolstered by artificial intelligence techniques and\nextensive data availability, offers new prospects for the implementation of\nATSC. In this study, we introduce a parallel hybrid action space reinforcement\nlearning model (PH-DDPG) that optimizes traffic signal phase and duration of\ntraffic signals simultaneously, eliminating the need for sequential\ndecision-making seen in traditional two-stage models. Our model features a\ntask-specific parallel hybrid action space tailored for adaptive traffic\ncontrol, which directly outputs discrete phase selections and their associated\ncontinuous duration parameters concurrently, thereby inherently addressing\ndynamic traffic adaptation through unified parametric optimization. %Our model\nfeatures a unique parallel hybrid action space that allows for the simultaneous\noutput of each action and its optimal parameters, streamlining the\ndecision-making process. Furthermore, to ascertain the robustness and\neffectiveness of this approach, we executed ablation studies focusing on the\nutilization of a random action parameter mask within the critic network, which\ndecouples the parameter space for individual actions, facilitating the use of\npreferable parameters for each action.

However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning,\nparticularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary.

When analyzing\ntime series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the\nmeasured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in\nthe stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we\nconduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer\nnatural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring\nwin probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games,\nfeaturing 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural\nlanguage events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we\nevaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer\nevents from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model\noutperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial\nperformance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we\nidentify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths,\nand evaluation strategy.

Agile planning using existing non-linear model\npredictive control methods is limited by the number of planning steps as it\nbecomes increasingly computationally demanding. That reduces the prediction\nhorizon length, leading to a decrease in solution quality. Besides, the fixed\ntime-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the\ntarget neighborhood.

A simplified point-mass motion primitive is used to leverage the\ndifferential flatness of quadrotor dynamics and the generation of feasible\ntrajectories in the flat output space.

    "abstract": "Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical to ensure product quality\nduring manufacturing. Although existing zero-shot defect segmentation and\ndetection methods have shown effectiveness, they cannot provide detailed\ndescriptions of the defects. Furthermore, the application of large multi-modal\nmodels in IAD remains in its infancy, facing challenges in balancing\nquestion-answering (QA) performance and mask-based grounding capabilities,\noften owing to overfitting during the fine-tuning process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach that introduces a dedicated multi-modal\ndefect localization module to decouple the dialog functionality from the core\nfeature extraction. This decoupling is achieved through independent\noptimization objectives and tailored learning strategies. Additionally, we\ncontribute to the first multi-modal industrial anomaly detection training\ndataset, named Defect Detection Question Answering (DDQA), encompassing a wide\nrange of defect types and industrial scenarios. Unlike conventional datasets\nthat rely on GPT-generated data, DDQA ensures authenticity and reliability and\noffers a robust foundation for model training. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our proposed method, Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Assistant\n(EIAD), achieves outstanding performance in defect detection and localization\ntasks. It not only significantly enhances accuracy but also improves\ninterpretability. These advancements highlight the potential of EIAD for\npractical applications in industrial settings.",

The performance of these models is determined by a complex\ninterdependence among the model architecture, optimization/loss function and\ndatasets. Although FRSs have surpassed human-level accuracy, they continue to\nbe disparate against certain demographics. Due to the ubiquity of applications,\nit is extremely important to understand the impact of the three components --\nmodel architecture, loss function and face image dataset on the\naccuracy-disparity trade-off to design better, unbiased platforms. In this\nwork, we perform an in-depth analysis of three FRSs for the task of gender\nprediction, with various architectural modifications resulting in ten\ndeep-learning models coupled with four loss functions and benchmark them on\nseven face datasets across 266 evaluation configurations. Our results show that\nall three components have an individual as well as a combined impact on both\naccuracy and disparity. We identify that datasets have an inherent property\nthat causes them to perform similarly across models, independent of the choice\nof loss functions. Moreover, the choice of dataset determines the model's\nperceived bias -- the same model reports bias in opposite directions for three\ngender-balanced datasets of ``in-the-wild'' face images of popular individuals.\nStudying the facial embeddings shows that the models are unable to generalize a\nuniform definition of what constitutes a ``female face'' as opposed to a ``male\nface'', due to dataset diversity.

    "abstract": "Automatic anatomical landmark localization in medical imaging requires not\njust accurate predictions but reliable uncertainty quantification for effective\nclinical decision support. Current uncertainty quantification approaches often\nfall short, particularly when combined with normality assumptions,\nsystematically underestimating total predictive uncertainty. This paper\nintroduces conformal prediction as a framework for reliable uncertainty\nquantification in anatomical landmark localization, addressing a critical gap\nin automatic landmark localization. We present two novel approaches\nguaranteeing finite-sample validity for multi-output prediction: Multi-output\nRegression-as-Classification Conformal Prediction (M-R2CCP) and its variant\nMulti-output Regression to Classification Conformal Prediction set to Region\n(M-R2C2R). Unlike conventional methods that produce axis-aligned\nhyperrectangular or ellipsoidal regions, our approaches generate flexible,\nnon-convex prediction regions that better capture the underlying uncertainty\nstructure of landmark predictions. Through extensive empirical evaluation\nacross multiple 2D and 3D datasets, we demonstrate that our methods\nconsistently outperform existing multi-output conformal prediction approaches\nin both validity and efficiency. This work represents a significant advancement\nin reliable uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark localization,\nproviding clinicians with trustworthy confidence measures for their diagnoses.\nWhile developed for medical imaging, these methods show promise for broader\napplications in multi-output regression problems.",

    "abstract": "Texture recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern\nrecognition. Recent progress leverages feature aggregation into discriminative\ndescriptions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, modeling\nnon-local context relations through visual primitives remains challenging due\nto the variability and randomness of texture primitives in spatial\ndistributions. In this paper, we propose a graph-enhanced texture encoding\nnetwork (GraphTEN) designed to capture both local and global features of\ntexture primitives. GraphTEN models global associations through fully connected\ngraphs and captures cross-scale dependencies of texture primitives via\nbipartite graphs. Additionally, we introduce a patch encoding module that\nutilizes a codebook to achieve an orderless representation of texture by\nencoding multi-scale patch features into a unified feature space. The proposed\nGraphTEN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods\nacross five publicly available datasets.",

    "abstract": "Long-term test-time adaptation (TTA) is a challenging task due to error\naccumulation. Recent approaches tackle this issue by actively labeling a small\nproportion of samples in each batch, yet the annotation burden quickly grows as\nthe batch number increases. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve\neffortless active labeling so that a maximum of one sample is selected for\nannotation in each batch. First, we annotate the most valuable sample in each\nbatch based on the single-step optimization perspective in the TTA context. In\nthis scenario, the samples that border between the source- and target-domain\ndata distributions are considered the most feasible for the model to learn in\none iteration. Then, we introduce an efficient strategy to identify these\nsamples using feature perturbation. Second, we discover that the gradient\nmagnitudes produced by the annotated and unannotated samples have significant\nvariations. Therefore, we propose balancing their impact on model optimization\nusing two dynamic weights. Extensive experiments on the popular ImageNet-C, -R,\n-K, -A and PACS databases demonstrate that our approach consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly lower annotation costs.",

We therefore place value on a lightweight workflow\nfeaturing a minimal number of tools with limited features. The workflow is\nbuilt upon an extended ONNX model description allowing for validation of AI\nalgorithms from their generation to runtime deployment.

    "abstract": "Leading large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\nreasoning-intensive tasks, such as standardized educational testing. However,\nthey often require extensive training in low-resource settings with\ninaccessible infrastructure. Small or compact models, though more efficient,\nfrequently lack sufficient support for underrepresented languages, leaving a\nperformance gap in critical domains. This work explores the potential of\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning of compact open-weight language models to\nhandle reasoning-intensive tasks in the underrepresented Ukrainian language,\nbuilding on the findings of the ZNO-Eval benchmark. Parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of LLaMA 3.1 (8 billion parameters), LLaMA 3.2 (3 billion\nparameters), and Gemma 2 (9 billion parameters) models on chain-of-thought\nsolutions resulted in a modest test score improvement of up to 17.4% on complex\nmatching tasks and 1.6% overall compared to tuning on answer letters alone,\noffering enhanced interpretability and robustness. In addition, the proposed\ntuning method with joint task topic and step-by-step solution generation\noutperforms standard chain-of-thought tuning in matching tasks and provides a\n5.4% gain over the best LLaMA 3.2 model due to guiding the model to recall and\napply domain-relevant information. Contrasting obtained results with zero-shot\nevaluations of leading open-weight and proprietary models such as Qwen,\nDeepSeek R1, OpenAI o1 and o3, Gemini, and Claude, highlight that fine-tuning\nLLaMA and Gemma models with 2,032 step-by-step solutions and 20 to 50 million\ntrainable parameters on a single A100 GPU lets them outperform GPT-4o mini,\nMistral Large, and larger open-weight models. This research also evaluates how\nmerging the quantized adapter with the base model influences the generation\nquality.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been one of the most important discoveries\nin machine learning in recent years. LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI)\nassistants, such as ChatGPT, have consistently attracted the attention from\nresearchers, investors, and the general public, driving the rapid growth of\nthis industry. With the frequent introduction of new LLMs to the market, it\nbecomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between them, creating a demand\nfor new LLM comparison methods.\n  In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework\n(ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed. It compares texts\ngenerated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall\ndegree of similarity between their responses. The main advantage of this\nframework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as\nchatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose\nany information about their product.\n  To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying\nsimilarities between multiple LLMs are conducted. Additionally, these\nexperiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by\nConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking\ntechniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison\nexperiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot\nLLM comparison scenario.\n  The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of\nmultiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component\nanalysis (PCA). The ConSCompF output may provide useful insights into data that\nmight have been used during LLM training and help detect possible investment\nfraud attempts.",

One crucial\nelement is coordinated bimanual movements that enable functions that are\ndifficult to perform with one hand alone. In recent years, learning-based\nmodels that focus on the possibilities of bimanual movements have been\nproposed. However, the high degree of freedom of the robot makes it challenging\nto reason about control, and the left and right robot arms need to adjust their\nactions depending on the situation, making it difficult to realize more\ndexterous tasks. To address the issue, we focus on coordination and efficiency\nbetween both arms, particularly for synchronized actions. Therefore, we propose\na novel imitation learning architecture that predicts cooperative actions. We\ndifferentiate the architecture for both arms and add an intermediate encoder\nlayer, Inter-Arm Coordinated transformer Encoder (IACE), that facilitates\nsynchronization and temporal alignment to ensure smooth and coordinated\nactions. To verify the effectiveness of our architectures, we perform\ndistinctive bimanual tasks. The experimental results showed that our model\ndemonstrated a high success rate for comparison and suggested a suitable\narchitecture for the policy learning of bimanual manipulation.",

Existing SSDG methods that leverage only the unlabeled samples for\nwhich the model's predictions are highly confident (confident-unlabeled\nsamples), limit the full utilization of the available unlabeled data. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to explore a method for incorporating\nthe unconfident-unlabeled samples that were previously disregarded in SSDG\nsetting. To this end, we propose UPCSC to utilize these unconfident-unlabeled\nsamples in SSDG that consists of two modules: 1) Unlabeled Proxy-based\nContrastive learning (UPC) module, treating unconfident-unlabeled samples as\nadditional negative pairs and 2) Surrogate Class learning (SC) module,\ngenerating positive pairs for unconfident-unlabeled samples using their\nconfusing class set.

    "abstract": "Video object detection has made significant progress in recent years thanks\nto convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs).\nTypically, CNNs excel at capturing local features but struggle to model global\nrepresentations. Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global\nfeatures but face challenges in representing local feature details.\nOff-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to\nconduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously\nleverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender\nNetwork (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical\nimprovements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph\nconvolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we\ndevelop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual\ninformation, constituting global representations with long-range feature\ndependencies. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal GraphFormer module that\nutilizes local spatial and temporal relationships to aggregate features,\ngenerating new local representations that are complementary to the transformer\noutputs. Third, we design a global-local feature blender module to adaptively\ncouple transformer-based global representations and GraphFormer-based local\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGBFormer\nestablishes new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset.\nParticularly, our TGBFormer achieves 86.5% mAP while running at around 41.0 FPS\non a single Tesla A100 GPU.",

It squeezes out informative\ntokens and boosts image-text alignments. Specifically, the vision branch\nretains salient image patches and extracts relevant object classes, while the\ntext branch incorporates these classes to enhance captions.

While model-based\nreinforcement learning enhances the agent's reasoning and planning capabilities\nby constructing virtual environments, training such virtual environments can be\nvery complex. In order to build an efficient inference model and enhance the\nrepresentativeness of learning data, we propose the Counterfactual Experience\nAugmentation (CEA) algorithm. CEA leverages variational autoencoders to model\nthe dynamic patterns of state transitions and introduces randomness to model\nnon-stationarity. This approach focuses on expanding the learning data in the\nexperience pool through counterfactual inference and performs exceptionally\nwell in environments that follow the bisimulation assumption. Environments with\nbisimulation properties are usually represented by discrete observation and\naction spaces, we propose a sampling method based on maximum kernel density\nestimation entropy to extend CEA to various environments. By providing reward\nsignals for counterfactual state transitions based on real information, CEA\nconstructs a complete counterfactual experience to alleviate the\nout-of-distribution problem of the learning data, and outperforms general SOTA\nalgorithms in environments with difference properties. Finally, we discuss the\nsimilarities, differences and properties of generated counterfactual\nexperiences and real experiences. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Aegis1863/CEA.",

Recent work uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nto automate preference labeling, but a single final-state image generally fails\nto capture the agent's full motion. In this paper, we present a two-part\nsolution that both improves feedback accuracy and better aligns reward learning\nwith the agent's policy. First, we overlay trajectory sketches on final\nobservations to reveal the path taken, allowing VLMs to provide more reliable\npreferences-improving preference accuracy by approximately 15-20% in metaworld\ntasks. Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's\nperformance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data\ngenerated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30%\nin locomotion tasks. Empirical studies on metaworld demonstrate that our method\nachieves, for instance, around 70-80% success rate in all tasks, compared to\nbelow 50% for standard approaches.

The result of our analysis\nserves as a roadmap that covers trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE and\nhighlights areas for future exploration.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)\nhas significantly transformed logistics and supply chain management,\nparticularly in the pursuit of sustainability and eco-efficiency. This study\nexplores AI-based methodologies for optimizing logistics operations in the USA,\nfocusing on reducing environmental impact, improving fuel efficiency, and\nminimizing costs. Key AI applications include predictive analytics for demand\nforecasting, route optimization through machine learning, and AI-powered fuel\nefficiency strategies. Various models, such as Linear Regression, XGBoost,\nSupport Vector Machine, and Neural Networks, are applied to real-world\nlogistics datasets to reduce carbon emissions based on logistics operations,\noptimize travel routes to minimize distance and travel time, and predict future\ndeliveries to plan optimal routes. Other models such as K-Means and DBSCAN are\nalso used to optimize travel routes to minimize distance and travel time for\nlogistics operations. This study utilizes datasets from logistics companies'\ndatabases. The study also assesses model performance using metrics such as mean\nabsolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R2 score. This study also\nexplores how these models can be deployed to various platforms for real-time\nlogistics and supply chain use. The models are also examined through a thorough\ncase study, highlighting best practices and regulatory frameworks that promote\nsustainability. The findings demonstrate AI's potential to enhance logistics\nefficiency, reduce carbon footprints, and contribute to a more resilient and\nadaptive supply chain ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "This research evaluates the extent to which modern AI frameworks,\nspecifically TensorFlow and scikit-learn, adhere to the SOLID design principles\n- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface\nSegregation, and Dependency Inversion. Analyzing the frameworks architectural\ndocumentation and design philosophies, this research investigates architectural\ntrade-offs when balancing software engineering best practices with AI-specific\nneeds. I examined each frameworks documentation, source code, and architectural\ncomponents to evaluate their adherence to these principles. The results show\nthat both frameworks adopt certain aspects of SOLID design principles but make\nintentional trade-offs to address performance, scalability, and the\nexperimental nature of AI development. TensorFlow focuses on performance and\nscalability, sometimes sacrificing strict adherence to principles like Single\nResponsibility and Interface Segregation. While scikit-learns design philosophy\naligns more closely with SOLID principles through consistent interfaces and\ncomposition principles, sticking closer to SOLID guidelines but with occasional\ndeviations for performance optimizations and scalability. This research\ndiscovered that applying SOLID principles in AI frameworks depends on context,\nas performance, scalability, and flexibility often require deviations from\ntraditional software engineering principles. This research contributes to\nunderstanding how domain-specific constraints influence architectural decisions\nin modern AI frameworks and how these frameworks strategically adapted design\nchoices to effectively balance these contradicting requirements.",

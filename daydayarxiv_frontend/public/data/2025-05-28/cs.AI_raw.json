    "abstract": "Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future VLM development. Project page available at https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/NegVQA/.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili, Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages, even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6% of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the models.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM) to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution for merging LoRA models.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly approaching the level of proficiency in university-level symbolic mathematics required for applications in advanced science and technology. However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing the core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration, differential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we introduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic manipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity and complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic `perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and 97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models). This may indicate a recent \"phase transition\" in the generalization capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.",

A central bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons. Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.\n  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning. Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.\n  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach -- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a 21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating systematic evidence synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets. Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using about 25% less memory.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999 across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength, providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems, demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.",

    "abstract": "Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm, called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.",

    "abstract": "While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers' capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively \"turn off their brains\" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.",

    "abstract": "The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position paper argues that as the term \"foundation model\" is an evolving concept, its application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational science.",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets -- painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present $\\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on $\\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and suggest several important directions of future study.

By leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i) a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and (ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability. Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.",

Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.",

In this paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data Readiness) for federated learning (FL), a novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR) metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. CADRE generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics, rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are prepared for FL while preserving privacy. We demonstrate a practical application of CADRE by integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across six datasets and addressed seven different DR issues. The results illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of CADRE in ensuring DR across various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as utilizes valuable resources.",

Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds. Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches. A perceptual study further reveals that our model is nearly indistinguishable from real-world recordings, with a $42\\%$ confusion rate.",

We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through extensive experiments on five public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, WMDP, and PubMedQA), in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for quantifying access control in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans' interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated misinformation.\n  Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling. Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users' opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of labels.",

    "abstract": "The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics, neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While prior works established the importance of temporal evaluation and introduced selective classification in malware classification tasks, we take a complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain reliable and stable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not. We propose Aurora, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their confidence quality and operational resilience. Aurora subjects the confidence profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste valuable annotation budgets on non-informative samples for active learning, and leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. Aurora is further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in SOTA frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests it may be time to revisit the underlying assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed, the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly increase, rather than decrease, the $\\ell_p$ distance to clean samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.",

Through two case studies, we investigate whether LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent approach to benchmark creation.",

These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.

While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.",

Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts. In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks.

This complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions. Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making, enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However, current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities in response to real-time disruptions.

While the PREMAP approach is versatile, it is currently limited to fully-connected neural networks of moderate dimensionality. In order to tackle broader real-world use cases, we present novel algorithmic extensions to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved branching heuristics.

    ],
    "abstract": "A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory, human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history, judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration, generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.",

    "abstract": "The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses, especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved 100% attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than cent percent accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of coding theory.",

    "abstract": "Mental disorders including depression, anxiety, and other neurological disorders pose a significant global challenge, particularly among individuals exhibiting social avoidance tendencies. This study proposes a hybrid approach by leveraging smartphone sensor data measuring daily physical activities and analyzing their social media (Twitter) interactions for evaluating an individual's depression level. Using CNN-based deep learning models and Naive Bayes classification, we identify human physical activities accurately and also classify the user sentiments. A total of 33 participants were recruited for data acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical activities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six are derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition accuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter activities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several physical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity of depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high accuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly effective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal privacy.",

Experiments conducted on the SciFact, FIQA, and NFCorpus datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval quality with the MiniLM-v6 configuration. The performance difference is particularly pronounced in agentic re-ranking scenarios, indicating better alignment between MiniLM-v6's embedding space and LLM reasoning.

It develops the notion of co-augmentation, in which human judgement and CK's representational reach jointly produce forms of analysis that neither could generate alone.

MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map. Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.

    "abstract": "Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps), Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving. This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning, expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.",

In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen, Mistral, and Llama families.

In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.",

    "abstract": "Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user, and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning, to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.",

    "abstract": "Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding, is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality, particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals: (1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both speed and quality.",

    "abstract": "Modern recommender systems powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling complex user-item interactions, yet increasingly face scenarios requiring selective forgetting of training data. Beyond user requests to remove specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory frameworks mandate recommender systems' ability to eliminate the influence of certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches. We release our method implementation at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UnlearnRec.",

FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training.

    "abstract": "A common approach for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason is to train on chain-of-thought (CoT) traces of in-distribution reasoning problems, but such annotated data is costly to obtain for every problem of interest. We want reasoning models to generalize beyond their training distribution, and ideally to generalize compositionally: combine atomic reasoning skills to solve harder, unseen reasoning tasks. We take a step towards compositional generalization of reasoning skills when addressing a target compositional task that has no labeled CoT data. We find that simply training models on CoT data of atomic tasks leads to limited generalization, but minimally modifying CoT formats of constituent atomic tasks to be composable can lead to improvements. We can train \"atomic CoT\" models on the atomic tasks with Composable CoT data and combine them with multitask learning or model merging for better zero-shot performance on the target compositional task. Such a combined model can be further bootstrapped on a small amount of compositional data using rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT). Results on string operations and natural language skill compositions show that training LLMs on Composable CoT outperforms multitask learning and continued fine-tuning baselines within a given training data budget.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/Knowledge2Data.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning advances robot capabilities by enabling the acquisition of diverse behaviors from human demonstrations. However, large-scale datasets used for policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which can negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets by filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing robotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform curation at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level, failing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address this, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that filters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of imitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of low-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable actions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns. SCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data to remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module operating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant patterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies to achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement of 15.4% across multiple benchmarks.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to overcome a major obstacle in scaling RL for reasoning with LLMs, namely the collapse of policy entropy. Such phenomenon is consistently observed across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy entropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished exploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy performance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b between entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly indicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus bottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0, R=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration toward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics both theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change in policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and the change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy Gradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance term and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical conclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout training, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically. Through understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to control entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens. Specifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances respectively. Experiments show that these methods encourage exploration, thus helping policy escape entropy collapse and achieve better downstream performance.",

To address these limitations, we propose RICO, a novel framework that refines captions through visual reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage a text-to-image model to reconstruct a caption into a reference image, and prompt an MLLM to identify discrepancies between the original and reconstructed images to refine the caption. This process is performed iteratively, further progressively promoting the generation of more faithful and comprehensive descriptions. To mitigate the additional computational cost induced by the iterative process, we introduce RICO-Flash, which learns to generate captions like RICO using DPO.

We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case.

    "abstract": "In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested using tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also benefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that enables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical Domain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a structured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To bridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that automatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems. HDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting multi-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This paper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting the challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym interface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also provide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym framework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from International Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain. Additionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent scenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked domain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a valuable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in multi-agent contexts.",

    "abstract": "Although large language models demonstrate strong performance across various domains, they still struggle with numerous bad cases in mathematical reasoning. Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-error instruction in improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning through error generalization.",

Most deepfake detection and dataset creation research focuses on monolingual content, often overlooking the challenges of multilingual and code-switched speech, where multiple languages are mixed within the same discourse. Code-switching, especially between Arabic and English, is common in the Arab world and is widely used in digital communication. This linguistic mixing poses extra challenges for deepfake detection, as it can confuse models trained mostly on monolingual data. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{ArEnAV}, the first large-scale Arabic-English audio-visual deepfake dataset featuring intra-utterance code-switching, dialectal variation, and monolingual Arabic content. It \\textbf{contains 387k videos and over 765 hours of real and fake videos}. Our dataset is generated using a novel pipeline integrating four Text-To-Speech and two lip-sync models, enabling comprehensive analysis of multilingual multimodal deepfake detection.

    ],
    "abstract": "We present Fusion Steering, an activation steering methodology that improves factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) for question-answering (QA) tasks. This approach introduces flexible steering configurations, including full-layer steering and segmented steering. Unlike traditional methods constrained to single-layer or fixed-layer operations, Fusion Steering employs dynamic injection of prompt-specific activation deltas across all transformer layers. These activation deltas are derived from reference completions that combine the ground-truth answer with a model-generated explanation to facilitate semantically enriched, example-specific steering. The injection weights are optimized per prompt using Optuna, targeting a joint objective that balances token overlap (factual alignment) and perplexity (fluency proxy). Evaluation employs a composite score integrating token overlap and LLM-graded quality, encompassing factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance. Empirical results on 260 SimpleQA prompts (selected from 500 where the baseline failed) showcase the efficacy of segmented steering. Using Gemma-2-2B-IT with 8-bit quantization, segmented steering achieves an accuracy of 25.4% (outputs scoring $\\geq 0.6$), outperforming the baseline at 3.5% and full-layer steering at 16.2%. Under the stricter SimpleQA rubric, segmented steering boosts fully correct responses from 0.0% to 13.1%. These findings highlight the strengths of segmented, dynamic intervention strategies and the promise of per-prompt, full-network activation control. Fusion Steering is also amenable to sparse representations, such as Neuronpedia or sparse crosscoders, suggesting a promising direction for interpretable and scalable activation-level control in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span",

While existing approaches have made progress in visual and language modalities for physical understanding, they fail to effectively incorporate tactile information that provides crucial haptic feedback for real-world interaction. In this paper, we present VTV-LLM, the first multi-modal large language model for universal Visuo-Tactile Video (VTV) understanding that bridges the gap between tactile perception and natural language. To address the challenges of cross-sensor and cross-modal integration, we contribute VTV150K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 150,000 video frames from 100 diverse objects captured across three different tactile sensors (GelSight Mini, DIGIT, and Tac3D), annotated with four fundamental tactile attributes (hardness, protrusion, elasticity, and friction). We develop a novel three-stage training paradigm that includes VTV enhancement for robust visuo-tactile representation, VTV-text alignment for cross-modal correspondence, and text prompt finetuning for natural language generation. Our framework enables sophisticated tactile reasoning capabilities including feature assessment, comparative analysis, scenario-based decision making and so on. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that VTV-LLM achieves superior performance in tactile video understanding tasks, establishing a foundation for more intuitive human-machine interaction in tactile domains.",

Unlike the previous method that separates static content from dynamic motion, our method preserves the essential interdependence between these elements. Our approach progressively refines and inserts frames to fully accommodate the motion in an action while achieving better performance but less storage, considering the relation of gradients for each frame.

    "abstract": "Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research challenge in claim verification. While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs. Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight, specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.",

The proposed approach is tested on the MIMIC III healthcare and Adult Census datasets, with extensive benchmarking against leading classical models, CTGAN, and CopulaGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that our quantum model outperforms classical models by an average of 8.5% with respect to an overall similarity score from SDMetrics, while using only 0.072% of the parameters of the classical models. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of the models using two custom-designed metrics that demonstrate the ability of the proposed quantum model to generate useful and novel samples.

    "abstract": "We present Thinking with Generated Images, a novel paradigm that fundamentally transforms how large multimodal models (LMMs) engage with visual reasoning by enabling them to natively think across text and vision modalities through spontaneous generation of intermediate visual thinking steps. Current visual reasoning with LMMs is constrained to either processing fixed user-provided images or reasoning solely through text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). Thinking with Generated Images unlocks a new dimension of cognitive capability where models can actively construct intermediate visual thoughts, critique their own visual hypotheses, and refine them as integral components of their reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two complementary mechanisms: (1) vision generation with intermediate visual subgoals, where models decompose complex visual tasks into manageable components that are generated and integrated progressively, and (2) vision generation with self-critique, where models generate an initial visual hypothesis, analyze its shortcomings through textual reasoning, and produce refined outputs based on their own critiques. Our experiments on vision generation benchmarks show substantial improvements over baseline approaches, with our models achieving up to 50% (from 38% to 57%) relative improvement in handling complex multi-object scenarios. From biochemists exploring novel protein structures, and architects iterating on spatial designs, to forensic analysts reconstructing crime scenes, and basketball players envisioning strategic plays, our approach enables AI models to engage in the kind of visual imagination and iterative refinement that characterizes human creative, analytical, and strategic thinking.

    "abstract": "Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset. While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision, highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and operational needs of fraud detection systems.",

Specifically, we consider stronger variants of JR, PJR, and EJR, and introduce temporal adaptations of more demanding multiwinner axioms, such as EJR+, full JR (FJR), full proportional JR (FPJR), and the Core. For each of these concepts, we investigate its existence and study its relationship to existing notions, thereby establishing a rich hierarchy of proportionality concepts.

The agents must collaborate with unfamiliar agents and human users, whose goals are often vague and implicit. In such settings, interpreting ambiguous instructions and uncovering underlying desires is essential for effective assistance. Therefore, fast and accurate desire alignment becomes a critical capability for embodied agents. In this work, we first develop a home assistance simulation environment HA-Desire that integrates an LLM-driven proxy human user exhibiting realistic value-driven goal selection and communication. The ego agent must interact with this proxy user to infer and adapt to the user's latent desires. To achieve this, we present a novel framework FAMER for fast desire alignment, which introduces a desire-based mental reasoning mechanism to identify user intent and filter desire-irrelevant actions. We further design a reflection-based communication module that reduces redundant inquiries, and incorporate goal-relevant information extraction with memory persistence to improve information reuse and reduce unnecessary exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances both task execution and communication efficiency, enabling embodied agents to quickly adapt to user-specific desires in complex embodied environments.",

Prior work has shown empirically that estimating a history-dependent behavior policy can lead to lower mean squared error (MSE) even when the true behavior policy is Markovian. However, the question of why the use of history should lower MSE remains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by deriving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance sampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy estimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their finite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions on a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these findings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS estimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with the behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.",

    "abstract": "Scaling limits, such as infinite-width limits, serve as promising theoretical tools to study large-scale models. However, it is widely believed that existing infinite-width theory does not faithfully explain the behavior of practical networks, especially those trained in standard parameterization (SP) meaning He initialization with a global learning rate. For instance, existing theory for SP predicts instability at large learning rates and vanishing feature learning at stable ones. In practice, however, optimal learning rates decay slower than theoretically predicted and networks exhibit both stable training and non-trivial feature learning, even at very large widths. Here, we show that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width phenomena.\n  Instead, we find a resolution through a finer-grained analysis of the regime previously considered unstable and therefore uninteresting. In particular, we show that, under cross-entropy (CE) loss, the unstable regime comprises two distinct sub-regimes: a catastrophically unstable regime and a more benign controlled divergence regime, where logits diverge but gradients and activations remain stable. Moreover, under large learning rates at the edge of the controlled divergence regime, there exists a well-defined infinite width limit where features continue to evolve in all the hidden layers. In experiments across optimizers, architectures, and data modalities, we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for predicting empirically maximal stable learning rate exponents which provide useful guidance on optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise learning rate scaling for standard initialization.",

We show that modality collapse happens when noisy features from one modality are entangled, via a shared set of neurons in the fusion head, with predictive features from another, effectively masking out positive contributions from the predictive features of the former modality and leading to its collapse. We further prove that cross-modal knowledge distillation implicitly disentangles such representations by freeing up rank bottlenecks in the student encoder, denoising the fusion-head outputs without negatively impacting the predictive features from either modality. Based on the above findings, we propose an algorithm that prevents modality collapse through explicit basis reallocation, with applications in dealing with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks validate our theoretical claims. Project page: https://abhrac.github.io/mmcollapse/.",

It reviews the current research methodologies and research agenda within the HAC field from the HCAI perspective, highlighting advancements and ongoing studies. Furthermore, a framework for human-centered HAC (HCHAC) is proposed by integrating these reviews and analyses. A case study of HAC in the context of autonomous vehicles is provided, illustrating practical applications and the synergistic interactions between humans and AI agents.

We identify three fundamental components--agents, communication links, and overall topology--that collectively determine the system's adaptability, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. To operationalize this vision, we introduce a systematic three-stage framework: 1) agent selection, 2) structure profiling, and 3) topology synthesis. This framework not only provides a principled foundation for designing MASs but also opens new research frontiers across language modeling, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling to ultimately unleash their full potential in complex real-world applications. We conclude by outlining key challenges and opportunities in MASs evaluation. We hope our framework and perspectives offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.",

Existing tasks such as video question answering often rely on annotations from humans or much stronger MLLMs, while video captioning tends to entangle temporal reasoning with spatial information. To address this gap, we propose next-event prediction (NEP), a learning task that harnesses future video segments as a rich, self-supervised signal to foster temporal reasoning. We segment each video into past and future frames: the MLLM takes the past frames as input and predicts a summary of events derived from the future frames, thereby encouraging the model to reason temporally in order to complete the task. To support this task, we curate V1-33K, a dataset comprising 33,000 automatically extracted video segments spanning diverse real-world scenarios. We further explore a range of video instruction-tuning strategies to study their effects on temporal reasoning. To evaluate progress, we introduce FutureBench to assess coherence in predicting unseen future events. Experiments validate that NEP offers a scalable and effective training paradigm for fostering temporal reasoning in MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), which require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. This limitation has motivated a growing interest in unsupervised paradigms as a third stage of post-training after SFT and RL. While recent efforts have explored this direction, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. To address this, we propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs, enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. The training method of MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that such training method effectively improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3\\%$\\rightarrow$72.9\\% on MathVista, 62.9\\%$\\rightarrow$68.7\\% on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. To further explore scalability, we extend our framework to a data self-generation setting, designing two strategies that prompt the MLLM to synthesize new training samples on its own. Additional experiments show that combining these synthetic data with the unsupervised training method can also boost performance, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for autonomous enhancement of MLLMs, serving as a critical third step after initial SFT and RL in the absence of external supervision.

Our key insight is to incorporate neural features learned by deep learning-based shape matching networks into an iterative, geometric shape registration pipeline. The advantage of our approach is two-fold -- On one hand, neural features provide more accurate and semantically meaningful correspondence estimation than spatial features (e.g., coordinates), which is critical in the presence of large non-rigid deformations; On the other hand, the correspondences are dynamically updated according to the intermediate registrations and filtered by consistency prior, which prominently robustify the overall pipeline. Empirical results show that, with as few as dozens of training shapes of limited variability, our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks of non-rigid point cloud matching and partial shape matching across varying settings, but also delivers high-quality correspondences between unseen challenging shape pairs that undergo both significant extrinsic and intrinsic deformations, in which case neither traditional registration methods nor intrinsic methods work.",

Offline RL in principle offers a solution by exploiting offline data to learn a near-optimal policy before deployment. In practice, however, current offline RL methods rely on extensive online interactions for hyperparameter tuning, and have no reliable bound on their initial online performance. To address these two issues, we introduce two algorithms. Firstly, SOReL: an algorithm for safe offline reinforcement learning. Using only offline data, our Bayesian approach infers a posterior over environment dynamics to obtain a reliable estimate of the online performance via the posterior predictive uncertainty. Crucially, all hyperparameters are also tuned fully offline. Secondly, we introduce TOReL: a tuning for offline reinforcement learning algorithm that extends our information rate based offline hyperparameter tuning methods to general offline RL approaches. Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately estimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter tuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter tuning methods using only offline data. Thus, SOReL and TOReL make a significant step towards safe and reliable offline RL, unlocking the potential for RL in the real world.

This scene function models how optical rays bring color information from a 3D object to the camera pixels. Radio frequency (RF) or audio signals can also be viewed as a vehicle for delivering information about the environment to a sensor. However, unlike camera pixels, an RF/audio sensor receives a mixture of signals that contain many environmental reflections (also called \"multipath\"). Is it still possible to infer the environment using such multipath signals? We show that with redesign, NeRFs can be taught to learn from multipath signals, and thereby \"see\" the environment. As a grounding application, we aim to infer the indoor floorplan of a home from sparse WiFi measurements made at multiple locations inside the home. Although a difficult inverse problem, our implicitly learnt floorplans look promising, and enables forward applications, such as indoor signal prediction and basic ray tracing.",

    "abstract": "Recent contributions of semantic information theory reveal the set-element relationship between semantic and syntactic information, represented as synonymous relationships. In this paper, we propose a synonymous variational inference (SVI) method based on this synonymity viewpoint to re-analyze the perceptual image compression problem. It takes perceptual similarity as a typical synonymous criterion to build an ideal synonymous set (Synset), and approximate the posterior of its latent synonymous representation with a parametric density by minimizing a partial semantic KL divergence. This analysis theoretically proves that the optimization direction of perception image compression follows a triple tradeoff that can cover the existing rate-distortion-perception schemes. Additionally, we introduce synonymous image compression (SIC), a new image compression scheme that corresponds to the analytical process of SVI, and implement a progressive SIC codec to fully leverage the model's capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate comparable rate-distortion-perception performance using a single progressive SIC codec, thus verifying the effectiveness of our proposed analysis method.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks.

This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with actual data from the database.

    "abstract": "Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages, including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems, particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, diffusion models only access noisy data $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample $\\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are typically applied to the expectation of clean samples $\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{x}_0|\\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints into diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \\textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\\&M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\\&M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, We minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive a closed-form solution for the merging coefficient under mild assumptions. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\\&M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/qhmiao/P-M-for-Continual-Learning.",

To this end, we propose the Domain-Aware Module (DAM), a training-time module that embeds domain-related features into each synthetic image via learnable spatial masks. As explicit domain labels are mostly unavailable in real-world datasets, we employ frequency-based pseudo-domain labeling, which leverages low-frequency amplitude statistics. DAM is only active during the condensation process, thus preserving the same images per class (IPC) with prior methods. Experiments show that DAM consistently improves in-domain, out-of-domain, and cross-architecture performance over baseline dataset condensation methods.",

    "abstract": "Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks, and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. OA-Adapter achieves higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark, and maintains its advantages on two larger benchmarks comprising 15 tasks.",

The suitability filter evaluates whether classifier accuracy on unlabeled user data shows significant degradation compared to the accuracy measured on the labeled test dataset. Specifically, it ensures that this degradation does not exceed a pre-specified margin, which represents the maximum acceptable drop in accuracy. To achieve reliable performance evaluation, we aggregate suitability signals for both test and user data and compare these empirical distributions using statistical hypothesis testing, thus providing insights into decision uncertainty. Our modular method adapts to various models and domains. Empirical evaluations across different classification tasks demonstrate that the suitability filter reliably detects performance deviations due to covariate shift. This enables proactive mitigation of potential failures in high-stakes applications.",

    "abstract": "Low-altitude economy (LAE) represents an emerging economic paradigm that redefines commercial and social aerial activities. Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we outline open challenges to inspire future research.",

    "abstract": "Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate that natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful signal for fine-grained policy optimization.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities, with reinforcement learning (RL) playing a crucial role in this progress. While \"aha moment\" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start.",

In this work, we present Skywork-OR1, an effective and scalable RL implementation for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models. Building on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series, our RL approach achieves notable performance gains, increasing average accuracy across AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench from 57.8% to 72.8% (+15.0%) for the 32B model and from 43.6% to 57.5% (+13.9%) for the 7B model. Our Skywork-OR1-32B model surpasses both DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on the AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks, while achieving comparable results on LiveCodeBench. The Skywork-OR1-7B and Skywork-OR1-Math-7B models demonstrate competitive reasoning capabilities among models of similar size. We perform comprehensive ablation studies on the core components of our training pipeline to validate their effectiveness. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of entropy collapse, identify key factors affecting entropy dynamics, and demonstrate that mitigating premature entropy collapse is critical for improved test performance.

This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge technologies and practical guidance. First, we outline the background of 6G communications, review the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI, and clarify the tutorial's motivation and main contributions. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive review of the key components required for constructing LAMs. We further categorize LAMs and analyze their applicability, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), and lightweight LAMs. Next, we propose a LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communications, encompassing dataset construction and both internal and external learning approaches. Building upon this, we develop an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, clarifying its core components such as planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules, as well as its interaction mechanisms. We also introduce a multi-agent framework with data retrieval, collaborative planning, and reflective evaluation for 6G. Subsequently, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios. Finally, we summarize the research challenges and future directions in current studies, aiming to support the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent unlearning methods for LLMs are vulnerable to relearning attacks: knowledge believed-to-be-unlearned re-emerges by fine-tuning on a small set of (even seemingly-unrelated) examples. We study this phenomenon in a controlled setting for example-level unlearning in vision classifiers. We make the surprising discovery that forget-set accuracy can recover from around 50% post-unlearning to nearly 100% with fine-tuning on just the retain set -- i.e., zero examples of the forget set. We observe this effect across a wide variety of unlearning methods, whereas for a model retrained from scratch excluding the forget set (gold standard), the accuracy remains at 50%. We observe that resistance to relearning attacks can be predicted by weight-space properties, specifically, $L_2$-distance and linear mode connectivity between the original and the unlearned model. Leveraging this insight, we propose a new class of methods that achieve state-of-the-art resistance to relearning attacks.",

Here we propose UniCardio, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that reconstructs low-quality signals and synthesizes unrecorded signals in a unified generative framework. Its key innovations include a specialized model architecture to manage the signal modalities involved in generation tasks and a continual learning paradigm to incorporate varying modality combinations. By exploiting the complementary nature of cardiovascular signals, UniCardio clearly outperforms recent task-specific baselines in signal denoising, imputation, and translation. The generated signals match the performance of ground-truth signals in detecting abnormal health conditions and estimating vital signs, even in unseen domains, while ensuring interpretability for human experts. These advantages position UniCardio as a promising avenue for advancing AI-assisted healthcare.",

Its usability is evaluated in comparison to a more traditional graphical content management system (CMS), with a focus on understanding the relationship between user preferences and the complexity of the information being provided. The findings demonstrate that, while the overall usability of the VUI is rated lower than the graphical interface, it is already preferred by users for less complex tasks. Furthermore, the quality of content entered through the VUI is comparable to that achieved with the graphical interface, even for highly complex tasks. Obtained qualitative results suggest that a hybrid interface combining the strengths of both approaches could address the key challenges identified during the experiment, such as reducing cognitive load through graphical feedback while maintaining the intuitive nature of voice-based interactions. This work highlights the potential of conversational interfaces as a viable and effective method for knowledge management in specific business contexts.",

    "abstract": "The preservation of early visual arts, particularly color photographs, is challenged by deterioration caused by aging and improper storage, leading to issues like blurring, scratches, color bleeding, and fading defects. Despite great advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such systematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art software features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the incorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning techniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes with defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and present the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an approach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively obtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a generative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for color imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration of the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative techniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require significant manual effort.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when trained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant challenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature relies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for evaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs' deliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance ceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of in-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find that by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with internal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on tasks previously deemed \"unsolvable\" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%). We provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this combination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on controlled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to previously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically, we show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling, significantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs on complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically underestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that fully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a better understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world deployments.",

To obtain a lifted representation, the state-of-the-art algorithm Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) groups factors that represent matching distributions. In an approximate version using $\\varepsilon$ as a hyperparameter, factors are grouped that differ by a factor of at most $(1\\pm \\varepsilon)$. However, finding a suitable $\\varepsilon$ is not obvious and may need a lot of exploration, possibly requiring many ACP runs with different $\\varepsilon$ values. Additionally, varying $\\varepsilon$ can yield wildly different models, leading to decreased interpretability. Therefore, this paper presents a hierarchical approach to lifted model construction that is hyperparameter-free. It efficiently computes a hierarchy of $\\varepsilon$ values that ensures a hierarchy of models, meaning that once factors are grouped together given some $\\varepsilon$, these factors will be grouped together for larger $\\varepsilon$ as well. The hierarchy of $\\varepsilon$ values also leads to a hierarchy of error bounds. This allows for explicitly weighing compression versus accuracy when choosing specific $\\varepsilon$ values to run ACP with and enables interpretability between the different models.",

    "abstract": "If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.",

    "abstract": "While (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention due to their exceptional capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Various defense methods are proposed to defend against jailbreak attacks, however, they are often tailored to specific types of jailbreak attacks, limiting their effectiveness against diverse adversarial strategies. For instance, rephrasing-based defenses are effective against text adversarial jailbreaks but fail to counteract image-based attacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a universal defense framework, termed Test-time IMmunization (TIM), which can adaptively defend against various jailbreak attacks in a self-evolving way. Specifically, TIM initially trains a gist token for efficient detection, which it subsequently applies to detect jailbreak activities during inference. When jailbreak attempts are identified, TIM implements safety fine-tuning using the detected jailbreak instructions paired with refusal answers. Furthermore, to mitigate potential performance degradation in the detector caused by parameter updates during safety fine-tuning, we decouple the fine-tuning process from the detection module. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of TIM.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However, while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.",

    "abstract": "The bi-objective shortest-path (BOSP) problem seeks to find paths between start and target vertices of a graph while optimizing two conflicting objective functions. We consider the BOSP problem in the presence of correlated objectives. Such correlations often occur in real-world settings such as road networks, where optimizing two positively correlated objectives, such as travel time and fuel consumption, is common. BOSP is generally computationally challenging as the size of the search space is exponential in the number of objective functions and the graph size. Bounded sub-optimal BOSP solvers such as A*pex alleviate this complexity by approximating the Pareto-optimal solution set rather than computing it exactly (given a user-provided approximation factor). As the correlation between objective functions increases, smaller approximation factors are sufficient for collapsing the entire Pareto-optimal set into a single solution. We leverage this insight to propose an efficient algorithm that reduces the search effort in the presence of correlated objectives. Our approach for computing approximations of the entire Pareto-optimal set is inspired by graph-clustering algorithms. It uses a preprocessing phase to identify correlated clusters within a graph and to generate a new graph representation. This allows a natural generalization of A*pex to run up to five times faster on DIMACS dataset instances, a standard benchmark in the field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm proposed that efficiently and effectively exploits correlations in the context of bi-objective search while providing theoretical guarantees on solution quality.",

Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2.

    "abstract": "Mathematical optimization is a fundamental tool for decision-making in a wide range of applications. However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of the optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning (DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy. While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation. In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope. Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this as loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high decision quality.",

    "abstract": "Trustworthy verifiers are essential for the success of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR), which is the core methodology behind various large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. In complex domains like mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct, particularly after fine-tuning. This vulnerability is exploited during policy model optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore the unique challenges inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers and provide insights toward developing more accurate and robust reward systems for reinforcement learning.",

This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.",

We investigate this for image-text binding in VLMs using a synthetic dataset and task that requires models to associate 3D objects in an image with their descriptions in the text.

Concurrently, the entangled nature of deep neural networks leads to a multifaceted problem, where various localized explanation techniques reveal that multiple unrelated features influence the decisions, thereby undermining interpretability. To address these challenges, we develop a Bayesian Non-negative Decision Layer (BNDL), which reformulates deep neural networks as a conditional Bayesian non-negative factor analysis. By leveraging stochastic latent variables, the BNDL can model complex dependencies and provide robust uncertainty estimation. Moreover, the sparsity and non-negativity of the latent variables encourage the model to learn disentangled representations and decision layers, thereby improving interpretability. We also offer theoretical guarantees that BNDL can achieve effective disentangled learning. In addition, we developed a corresponding variational inference method utilizing a Weibull variational inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate that with enhanced disentanglement capabilities, BNDL not only improves the model's accuracy but also provides reliable uncertainty estimation and improved interpretability.",

Some users evade censorship by deliberately disguising toxic words through homophonic cloak, which necessitates the task of unveiling cloaked toxicity. Existing methods are mostly designed for English texts, while Chinese cloaked toxicity unveiling has not been solved yet. To tackle the issue, we propose C$^2$TU, a novel training-free and prompt-free method for Chinese cloaked toxic content unveiling. It first employs substring matching to identify candidate toxic words based on Chinese homo-graph and toxic lexicon. Then it filters those candidates that are non-toxic and corrects cloaks to be their corresponding toxicities. Specifically, we develop two model variants for filtering, which are based on BERT and LLMs, respectively. For LLMs, we address the auto-regressive limitation in computing word occurrence probability and utilize the full semantic contexts of a text sequence to reveal cloaked toxic words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^2$TU can achieve superior performance on two Chinese toxic datasets. In particular, our method outperforms the best competitor by up to 71% on the F1 score and 35% on accuracy, respectively.

Speculative decoding mitigates the memory bandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass, which increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization by compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces computations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their strengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques. Surprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method EAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit weight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative decoding. Specifically, verifying a tree-style draft incurs significantly more time overhead than a single-token forward pass on 4-bit weight quantized models. This finding led to our new speculative decoding design: a hierarchical framework that employs a small model as an intermediate stage to turn tree-style drafts into sequence drafts, leveraging the memory access benefits of the target quantized model. Experimental results show that our hierarchical approach achieves a 2.78$\\times$ speedup across various tasks for the 4-bit weight Llama-3-70B model on an A100 GPU, outperforming EAGLE-2 by 1.31$\\times$.

It is known that without any assumptions about the values being severely restricted or coming from a distribution, very strong impossibility results hold in this setting. To bypass the latter, we turn our attention to instances where the valuation functions are restricted. In particular, we study personalized $2$-value instances, where there are only two possible values each agent may have for each good, possibly different across agents, and we show how to obtain worst case guarantees with respect to well-known fairness notions, such as maximin share fairness and envy-freeness up to one (or two) good(s). We suggest a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $1/(2n-1)$-MMS allocation at every time step and show that this is the best possible any deterministic algorithm can achieve if one cares about every single time step; nevertheless, eventually the allocation constructed by our algorithm becomes a $1/4$-MMS allocation. To achieve this, the algorithm implicitly maintains a fragile system of priority levels for all agents. Further, we show that, by allowing some limited access to future information, it is possible to have stronger results with less involved approaches. By knowing the values of goods for $n-1$ time steps into the future, we design a matching-based algorithm that achieves an EF$1$ allocation every $n$ time steps, while always maintaining an EF$2$ allocation. Finally, we show that our results allow us to get the first nontrivial guarantees for additive instances in which the ratio of the maximum over the minimum value an agent has for a good is bounded.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation, with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\underline{N}}on-simultan\\textbf{\\underline{e}}ous C\\textbf{\\underline{o}}ntinuous \\textbf{\\underline{Diff}}usion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation.",

There is a need for innovation to ease the access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the field of art history regarding such creative diversions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have popularized Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT), a strategy that encourages deliberate and step-by-step reasoning before producing a final answer. While LCoTs have enabled expert-level performance in complex tasks, how the internal structures of their reasoning chains drive, or even predict, the correctness of final answers remains a critical yet underexplored question. In this work, we present LCoT2Tree, an automated framework that converts sequential LCoTs into hierarchical tree structures and thus enables deeper structural analysis of LLM reasoning. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we reveal that structural patterns extracted by LCoT2Tree, including exploration, backtracking, and verification, serve as stronger predictors of final performance across a wide range of tasks and models. Leveraging an explainability technique, we further identify critical thought patterns such as over-branching that account for failures. Beyond diagnostic insights, the structural patterns by LCoT2Tree support practical applications, including improving Best-of-N decoding effectiveness. Overall, our results underscore the critical role of internal structures of reasoning chains, positioning LCoT2Tree as a powerful tool for diagnosing, interpreting, and improving reasoning in LLMs.",

A problem is that, with increasing numbers of (indistinguishable) objects, the state space grows exponentially. To compute policies, the state space has to be enumerated. Even more possibilities have to be enumerated if the size of the action space depends on the size of the state space, especially if we allow concurrent actions. To tackle the exponential blow-up in the action and state space, we present a first-order representation to store the spaces in polynomial instead of exponential size in the number of objects and introduce Foreplan, a relational forward planner, which uses this representation to efficiently compute policies for numerous indistinguishable objects and actions. Additionally, we introduce an even faster approximate version of Foreplan. Moreover, Foreplan identifies how many objects an agent should act on to achieve a certain task given restrictions. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation of Foreplan, demonstrating a speedup of at least four orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Human evaluation studies validate our framework's alignment with human decision-making patterns, and generalization experiments demonstrate effective performance on novel tool categories. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, elongation, hand-relatedness) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in audio-driven talking head generation have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization and emotional expression. However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is indispensable for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, flexible adjustment of visual attributes, such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features, is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to representative baseline methods in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, and attribute controllability.

    "abstract": "Identifying arguments is a necessary prerequisite for various tasks in automated discourse analysis, particularly within contexts such as political debates, online discussions, and scientific reasoning. In addition to theoretical advances in understanding the constitution of arguments, a significant body of research has emerged around practical argument mining, supported by a growing number of publicly available datasets. On these benchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best, reinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse contexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of such state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to generalize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three standard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better generalization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the task. Our findings show that, to varying degrees, these models tend to rely on lexical shortcuts tied to content words, suggesting that apparent progress may often be driven by dataset-specific cues rather than true task alignment. While the models achieve strong results on familiar benchmarks, their performance drops markedly when applied to unseen datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating both task-specific pre-training and joint benchmark training proves effective in enhancing both robustness and generalization.",

Early diffusion models emphasized perceptual quality, while newer multimodal models like GPT-4o-image integrate high-level reasoning, improving semantic understanding and structural composition. Scientific illustration generation exemplifies this evolution: unlike general image synthesis, it demands accurate interpretation of technical content and transformation of abstract ideas into clear, standardized visuals. This task is significantly more knowledge-intensive and laborious, often requiring hours of manual work and specialized tools. Automating it in a controllable, intelligent manner would provide substantial practical value. Yet, no benchmark currently exists to evaluate AI on this front. To fill this gap, we introduce SridBench, the first benchmark for scientific figure generation. It comprises 1,120 instances curated from leading scientific papers across 13 natural and computer science disciplines, collected via human experts and MLLMs. Each sample is evaluated along six dimensions, including semantic fidelity and structural accuracy. Experimental results reveal that even top-tier models like GPT-4o-image lag behind human performance, with common issues in text/visual clarity and scientific correctness.

These limitations constrain its effectiveness in applications that require predictive insight, such as policy testing, narrative framing, and behavioral forecasting. We present a robust framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs, and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached 81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials (+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676, Cohen's d = 0.02). Our findings establish a scalable framework for sentiment modeling through psychographically grounded AI agents.

Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios.

Our results reveal that VLLMs achieve or surpass human-level set-shifting capabilities under chain-of-thought prompting with text-based inputs. However, their abilities are highly influenced by both input modality and prompting strategy. In addition, we find that through role-playing, VLLMs can simulate various functional deficits aligned with patients having impairments in cognitive flexibility, suggesting that VLLMs may possess a cognitive architecture, at least regarding the ability of set-shifting, similar to the brain. This study reveals the fact that VLLMs have already approached the human level on a key component underlying our higher cognition, and highlights the potential to use them to emulate complex brain processes.",

Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have significantly improved the quality and diversity of audio generation but are hindered by slow inference speed. Rectified flow enhances inference speed by learning straight-line ordinary differential equation (ODE) paths. However, this approach requires training a flow-matching model from scratch and tends to perform suboptimally, or even poorly, at low step counts. To address the limitations of rectified flow while leveraging the advantages of advanced pre-trained diffusion models, this study integrates pre-trained models with the rectified diffusion method to improve the efficiency of text-to-audio (TTA) generation. Specifically, we propose AudioTurbo, which learns first-order ODE paths from deterministic noise sample pairs generated by a pre-trained TTA model. Experiments on the AudioCaps dataset demonstrate that our model, with only 10 sampling steps, outperforms prior models and reduces inference to 3 steps compared to a flow-matching-based acceleration model.",

    "abstract": "Shielding has emerged as a promising approach for ensuring safety of AI-controlled autonomous systems. The algorithmic goal is to compute a shield, which is a runtime safety enforcement tool that needs to monitor and intervene the AI controller's actions if safety could be compromised otherwise. Traditional shields are designed statically for a specific safety requirement. Therefore, if the safety requirement changes at runtime due to changing operating conditions, the shield needs to be recomputed from scratch, causing delays that could be fatal. We introduce dynamic shields for parametric safety specifications, which are succinctly represented sets of all possible safety specifications that may be encountered at runtime. Our dynamic shields are statically designed for a given safety parameter set, and are able to dynamically adapt as the true safety specification (permissible by the parameters) is revealed at runtime. The main algorithmic novelty lies in the dynamic adaptation procedure, which is a simple and fast algorithm that utilizes known features of standard safety shields, like maximal permissiveness. We report experimental results for a robot navigation problem in unknown territories, where the safety specification evolves as new obstacles are discovered at runtime. In our experiments, the dynamic shields took a few minutes for their offline design, and took between a fraction of a second and a few seconds for online adaptation at each step, whereas the brute-force online recomputation approach was up to 5 times slower.",

Yet, the parametric knowledge in LLMs might be limited to covering all the diverse and domain-specific queries that require grounding in various database schemas, which makes generated SQLs less accurate oftentimes. To tackle this, we propose constructing the knowledge base for text-to-SQL, a foundational source of knowledge, from which we retrieve and generate the necessary knowledge for given queries. In particular, unlike existing approaches that either manually annotate knowledge or generate only a few pieces of knowledge for each query, our knowledge base is comprehensive, which is constructed based on a combination of all the available questions and their associated database schemas along with their relevant knowledge, and can be reused for unseen databases from different datasets and domains. We validate our approach on multiple text-to-SQL datasets, considering both the overlapping and non-overlapping database scenarios, where it outperforms relevant baselines substantially.",

Current approaches face a trade-off between latency and semantic richness: natural language-based systems provide detailed guidance but are too slow for dynamic scenarios, while emergent communication frameworks offer low-latency symbolic languages but lack semantic depth, limiting their utility in tactile modalities like vibration. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Cognitively-Inspired Emergent Communication via Knowledge Graphs (VAG-EC), which emulates human visual perception and cognitive mapping. Our method constructs knowledge graphs to represent objects and their relationships, incorporating attention mechanisms to prioritize task-relevant entities, thereby mirroring human selective attention. This structured approach enables the emergence of compact, interpretable, and context-sensitive symbolic languages. Extensive experiments across varying vocabulary sizes and message lengths demonstrate that VAG-EC outperforms traditional emergent communication methods in Topographic Similarity (TopSim) and Context Independence (CI). These findings underscore the potential of cognitively grounded emergent communication as a fast, adaptive, and human-aligned solution for real-time assistive technologies.

    "abstract": "High-Level Synthesis (HLS) serves as an agile hardware development tool that streamlines the circuit design by abstracting the register transfer level into behavioral descriptions, while allowing designers to customize the generated microarchitectures through optimization directives. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible directive configurations yields an intractable design space. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) methods, despite adopting heuristics or constructing predictive models to accelerate Pareto-optimal design acquisition, still suffer from prohibitive exploration costs and suboptimal results. Addressing these concerns, we introduce iDSE, the first LLM-aided DSE framework that leverages HLS design quality perception to effectively navigate the design space. iDSE intelligently pruns the design space to guide LLMs in calibrating representative initial sampling designs, expediting convergence toward the Pareto front. By exploiting the convergent and divergent thinking patterns inherent in LLMs for hardware optimization, iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of the design quality and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE methods by 5.1$\\times$$\\sim$16.6$\\times$ in proximity to the reference Pareto front, matching NSGA-II with only 4.6% of the explored designs. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in scalable and efficient HLS design optimization, offering new insights into multiobjective optimization challenges.",

    "abstract": "Modeling sophisticated activation functions within deep learning architectures has evolved into a distinct research direction. Functions such as GELU, SELU, and SiLU offer smooth gradients and improved convergence properties, making them popular choices in state-of-the-art models. Despite this trend, the classical ReLU remains appealing due to its simplicity, inherent sparsity, and other advantageous topological characteristics. However, ReLU units are prone to becoming irreversibly inactive - a phenomenon known as the dying ReLU problem - which limits their overall effectiveness. In this work, we introduce surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) as a novel, plug-and-play regularizer for deep architectures. SUGAR preserves the standard ReLU function during the forward pass but replaces its derivative in the backward pass with a smooth surrogate that avoids zeroing out gradients. We demonstrate that SUGAR, when paired with a well-chosen surrogate function, substantially enhances generalization performance over convolutional network architectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-18, providing sparser activations while effectively resurrecting dead ReLUs. Moreover, we show that even in modern architectures like Conv2NeXt and Swin Transformer - which typically employ GELU - substituting these with SUGAR yields competitive and even slightly superior performance. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that advanced activation functions are necessary for optimal performance. Instead, they suggest that the conventional ReLU, particularly with appropriate gradient handling, can serve as a strong, versatile revived classic across a broad range of deep learning vision models.",

By approximating Adam optimizer updates with first- and second-order Taylor expansions and utilizing random projection methods to store intermediate checkpoints, our framework can efficiently estimate model parameters for arbitrary training sample orders. Next, we apply our framework to two downstream research problems: (1) Training curriculum design for LLMs -- we base our retraining-free framework to propose a novel curriculum learning strategy that augments curriculum proposals with estimated model performances, enabling more informed sample scheduling. (2) LLMs' memorization and generalization effect analysis -- we use our retraining-free framework to estimate how the positions of training samples influence LLMs' capacity for memorization and generalization. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our retraining-free framework in reproducing the true model performances, and further demonstrate its potential in optimizing LLM training curricula and analyzing the memorization and generalization effects of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across multi-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the large number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and the use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through token pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image token diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods often overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output (local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning (BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our method utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into multiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of pruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts toward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments across various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while preserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average.

Experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. All data, models, and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/Berkeley-Speech-Group/LLM-Dys.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory sound datasets are limited in size and quality, making high performance difficult to achieve. Ensemble models help but inevitably increase compute cost at inference time. Soft label training distills knowledge efficiently with extra cost only at training. In this study, we explore soft labels for respiratory sound classification as an architecture-agnostic approach to distill an ensemble of teacher models into a student model. We examine different variations of our approach and find that even a single teacher, identical to the student, considerably improves performance beyond its own capability, with optimal gains achieved using only a few teachers. We achieve the new state-of-the-art Score of 64.39 on ICHBI, surpassing the previous best by 0.85 and improving average Scores across architectures by more than 1.16. Our results highlight the effectiveness of knowledge distillation with soft labels for respiratory sound classification, regardless of size or architecture.",

    "abstract": "Document Image Enhancement (DIE) serves as a critical component in Document AI systems, where its performance substantially determines the effectiveness of downstream tasks. To address the limitations of existing methods confined to single-degradation restoration or grayscale image processing, we present Global with Local Parametric Generation Enhancement Network (GL-PGENet), a novel architecture designed for multi-degraded color document images, ensuring both efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our solution incorporates three key innovations: First, a hierarchical enhancement framework that integrates global appearance correction with local refinement, enabling coarse-to-fine quality improvement. Second, a Dual-Branch Local-Refine Network with parametric generation mechanisms that replaces conventional direct prediction, producing enhanced outputs through learned intermediate parametric representations rather than pixel-wise mapping. This approach enhances local consistency while improving model generalization. Finally, a modified NestUNet architecture incorporating dense block to effectively fuse low-level pixel features and high-level semantic features, specifically adapted for document image characteristics. In addition, to enhance generalization performance, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: large-scale pretraining on a synthetic dataset of 500,000+ samples followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GL-PGENet, achieving state-of-the-art SSIM scores of 0.7721 on DocUNet and 0.9480 on RealDAE. The model also exhibits remarkable cross-domain adaptability and maintains computational efficiency for high-resolution images without performance degradation, confirming its practical utility in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG.",

In this paper, we introduce EHC, a general agent capable of learning without parameter updates. EHC consists of a Hierarchical Memory Retrieval (HMR) module and a Task-Category Oriented Experience Learning (TOEL) module. The HMR module facilitates rapid retrieval of relevant memories and continuously stores new information without being constrained by memory capacity. The TOEL module enhances the agent's comprehension of various task characteristics by classifying experiences and extracting patterns across different categories. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that EHC outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and underscoring its effectiveness as a general agent for handling complex multi-modal tasks.",

This paper introduces Legal Assist AI, a transformer-based model designed to bridge this gap by offering effective legal assistance through large language models (LLMs). The system retrieves relevant legal information from a curated database and generates accurate responses, enabling effective assistance for diverse users, including legal professionals, scholars, and the general public. The model was fine-tuned on extensive datasets from the Indian legal domain, including Indian Constitution, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and so forth, providing a robust understanding of the complexities of Indian law. By incorporating domain-specific legal datasets, the proposed model demonstrated remarkable efficiency and specialization in legal Question-Answering. The model was evaluated against state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and Mistral 7B, achieving a 60.08% score on the AIBE, outperforming its competitors in legal reasoning and accuracy. Unlike other models, Legal Assist AI avoided common issues such as hallucinations, making it highly reliable for practical legal applications. It showcases the model's applicability in real-world legal scenarios, with future iterations aiming to enhance performance and expand its dataset to cover a broader range of multilingual and case-specific queries as well.",

    "abstract": "Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.",

However, existing techniques rely primarily on structural graph isomorphism and thus fail to identify function-related subgraphs when synthesis transformations substantially alter circuit topology. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce the concept of functional subgraph matching, a novel approach that identifies whether a given logic function is implicitly present within a larger circuit, irrespective of structural variations induced by synthesis or technology mapping. Specifically, we propose a two-stage multi-modal framework: (1) learning robust functional embeddings across AIG and post-mapping netlists for functional subgraph detection, and (2) identifying fuzzy boundaries using a graph segmentation approach. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (ITC99, OpenABCD, ForgeEDA) demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing structural methods, with average $93.8\\%$ accuracy in functional subgraph detection and a dice score of $91.3\\%$ in fuzzy boundary identification.

We introduce two algorithms -Bandit-CPC and IPPO-CPC- and evaluate them in non-cooperative MARL tasks.

    "abstract": "Given the challenge of automatically evaluating free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs), an increasingly common solution is to use LLMs themselves as the judging mechanism, without any gold-standard scores. Implicitly, this practice accounts for only sampling variability (aleatoric uncertainty) and ignores uncertainty about judge quality (epistemic uncertainty). While this is justified if judges are perfectly accurate, it is unclear when such an approach is theoretically valid and practically robust. We study these questions for the task of ranking LLM candidates from a novel geometric perspective: for $M$-level scoring systems, both LLM judges and candidates can be represented as points on an $(M-1)$-dimensional probability simplex, where geometric concepts (e.g., triangle areas) correspond to key ranking concepts. This perspective yields intuitive theoretical conditions and visual proofs for when rankings are identifiable; for instance, we provide a formal basis for the ``folk wisdom'' that LLM judges are more effective for two-level scoring ($M=2$) than multi-level scoring ($M>2$). Leveraging the simplex, we design geometric Bayesian priors that encode epistemic uncertainty about judge quality and vary the priors to conduct sensitivity analyses. Experiments on LLM benchmarks show that rankings based solely on LLM judges are robust in many but not all datasets, underscoring both their widespread success and the need for caution. Our Bayesian method achieves substantially higher coverage rates than existing procedures, highlighting the importance of modeling epistemic uncertainty.",

We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.",

To further tailor LLMs to specific domains or applications, post-training techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Preference Learning, and model merging are commonly employed. While each of these methods has been extensively studied in isolation, the automated construction of complete post-training pipelines remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches typically rely on manual design or focus narrowly on optimizing individual components, such as data ordering or merging strategies. In this work, we introduce LaMDAgent (short for Language Model Developing Agent), a novel framework that autonomously constructs and optimizes full post-training pipelines through the use of LLM-based agents. LaMDAgent systematically explores diverse model generation techniques, datasets, and hyperparameter configurations, leveraging task-based feedback to discover high-performing pipelines with minimal human intervention. Our experiments show that LaMDAgent improves tool-use accuracy by 9.0 points while preserving instruction-following capabilities. Moreover, it uncovers effective post-training strategies that are often overlooked by conventional human-driven exploration. We further analyze the impact of data and model size scaling to reduce computational costs on the exploration, finding that model size scalings introduces new challenges, whereas scaling data size enables cost-effective pipeline discovery.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture, necessitating the integration of retrieval methods. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive applications such as virtual and augmented reality, where a first-person (egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While this view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object interactions, its narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead to failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we introduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person (exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene layout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark for multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs grounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a training-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene representation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary perspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views, yielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini 2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key strengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the value of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.

    "abstract": "We present UniTalk, a novel dataset specifically designed for the task of active speaker detection, emphasizing challenging scenarios to enhance model generalization. Unlike previously established benchmarks such as AVA, which predominantly features old movies and thus exhibits significant domain gaps, UniTalk focuses explicitly on diverse and difficult real-world conditions. These include underrepresented languages, noisy backgrounds, and crowded scenes - such as multiple visible speakers speaking concurrently or in overlapping turns. It contains over 44.5 hours of video with frame-level active speaker annotations across 48,693 speaking identities, and spans a broad range of video types that reflect real-world conditions. Through rigorous evaluation, we show that state-of-the-art models, while achieving nearly perfect scores on AVA, fail to reach saturation on UniTalk, suggesting that the ASD task remains far from solved under realistic conditions. Nevertheless, models trained on UniTalk demonstrate stronger generalization to modern \"in-the-wild\" datasets like Talkies and ASW, as well as to AVA. UniTalk thus establishes a new benchmark for active speaker detection, providing researchers with a valuable resource for developing and evaluating versatile and resilient models.\n  Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/plnguyen2908/UniTalk-ASD\n  Code: https://github.com/plnguyen2908/UniTalk-ASD-code",

We propose a more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model, explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies, revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.",

In pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there is a growing need for models that not only execute commands or retrieve information but also learn, reason, and generate new knowledge by formulating novel hypotheses and theories that deepen our understanding of the world. Guided by Peirce's framework of abduction, deduction, and induction, this survey offers a structured lens to examine LLM-based hypothesis discovery. We synthesize existing work in hypothesis generation, application, and validation, identifying both key achievements and critical gaps.

To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology.

Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions.

    "abstract": "In natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), the successful application of foundation models across diverse tasks has demonstrated their remarkable potential. However, despite the rich structural and textual information embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), existing research of foundation model for KG has primarily focused on their structural aspects, with most efforts restricted to in-KG tasks (e.g., knowledge graph completion, KGC). This limitation has hindered progress in addressing more challenging out-of-KG tasks. In this paper, we introduce MERRY, a foundation model for general knowledge graph reasoning, and investigate its performance across two task categories: in-KG reasoning tasks (e.g., KGC) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., KG question answering, KGQA). We not only utilize the structural information, but also the textual information in KGs. Specifically, we propose a multi-perspective Conditional Message Passing (CMP) encoding architecture to bridge the gap between textual and structural modalities, enabling their seamless integration. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic residual fusion module to selectively retain relevant textual information and a flexible edge scoring mechanism to adapt to diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on 28 datasets demonstrate that MERRY outperforms existing baselines in most scenarios, showcasing strong reasoning capabilities within KGs and excellent generalization to out-of-KG tasks such as KGQA.",

We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20 expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99% accuracy in topology inference, <10% relative error in performance prediction, and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.",

We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.",

Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the system's ability to detect, interpret, and align with individual user preferences. While prior work in intelligent assistants and optimization algorithms is extensive, their intersection within AI copilots remains underexplored. This survey addresses that gap by examining how user preferences are operationalized in AI copilots. We investigate how preference signals are sourced, modeled across different interaction stages, and refined through feedback loops. Building on a comprehensive literature review, we define the concept of an AI copilot and introduce a taxonomy of preference optimization techniques across pre-, mid-, and post-interaction phases. Each technique is evaluated in terms of advantages, limitations, and design implications. By consolidating fragmented efforts across AI personalization, human-AI interaction, and language model adaptation, this work offers both a unified conceptual foundation and a practical design perspective for building user-aligned, persona-aware AI copilots that support end-to-end adaptability and deployment.",

However, despite leveraging powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), existing end-to-end VLA systems often lose key capabilities during fine-tuning as the model adapts to specific robotic tasks. We argue that a generalizable VLA model should retain and expand upon the VLM's core competencies: 1) Open-world embodied reasoning - the VLA should inherit the knowledge from VLM, i.e., recognize anything that the VLM can recognize, be capable of solving math problems, and possess visual-spatial intelligence, 2) Reasoning following - effectively translating the open-world reasoning into actionable steps for the robot. In this work, we introduce ChatVLA-2, a novel mixture-of-expert VLA model coupled with a specialized two-stage training pipeline designed to preserve the VLM's original strengths while enabling actionable reasoning. To validate our approach, we design a math-matching task wherein a robot interprets math problems written on a whiteboard and picks corresponding number cards from a table to solve equations. Remarkably, our method exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities, despite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning skills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving previously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and comprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation learning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero.

By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11x smaller student improves over its zero-shot VFM teacher(s) by +8.5 and +7.1 AP, surpasses adapted teacher(s) by +3.4 and +1.5 AP, and further outperforms state-of-the-art SSKD methods on both benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, standalone agents frequently encounter limitations when handling complex tasks that demand extensive interactions and substantial computational resources. Although Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) alleviate some of these limitations through collaborative mechanisms like task decomposition, iterative communication, and role specialization, they typically remain resource-unaware, incurring significant inefficiencies due to high token consumption and excessive execution time. To address these limitations, we propose a resource-aware multi-agent system -- Co-Saving (meaning that multiple agents collaboratively engage in resource-saving activities), which leverages experiential knowledge to enhance operational efficiency and solution quality. Our key innovation is the introduction of \"shortcuts\" -- instructional transitions learned from historically successful trajectories -- which allows to bypass redundant reasoning agents and expedite the collective problem-solving process. Experiments for software development tasks demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art MAS ChatDev, our method achieves an average reduction of 50.85% in token usage, and improves the overall code quality by 10.06%.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of autonomous and assisted driving technologies, higher demands are placed on the ability to understand complex driving scenarios. Multimodal general large models have emerged as a solution for this challenge. However, applying these models in vertical domains involves difficulties such as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle, enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.",

Recently, there has been interest in the specific task of \\textit{Delta Compression}, where parties each hold a common base model and only communicate compressed weight updates. However, popular parameter efficient updates such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) face inherent representation limitations - which are especially pronounced when combined with aggressive quantization. To overcome this, we build on recent work that improves LoRA representation capacity by using fixed-frequency sinusoidal functions to increase stable rank without adding additional parameters. We extend this to the quantized setting and present the first theoretical analysis showing how stable rank evolves under quantization. From this, we introduce SineLoRA$Δ$, a principled and effective method for delta compression that improves the expressivity of quantized low-rank adapters by applying a sinusoidal activation. We validate SineLoRA$Δ$ across a diverse variety of domains - including language modeling, vision-language tasks, and text-to-image generation - achieving up to 66% memory reduction with similar performance. We additionally provide a novel application of the canonical Bjøntegaard Delta metric to consistently compare adapter compression changes across the rate-distortion curve.",

    "abstract": "Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\\&M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.",

Our pipeline generates diverse, constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups. Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic methods remain robust.

In this work, we introduce a pre-trained symbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with numerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical representations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic regression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of network dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry, ecology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in equation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline approaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our model to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global epidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the application boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex networks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the hidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing interpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches on 3D camera control in video diffusion models (VDMs) often create anchor videos to guide diffusion models as a structured prior by rendering from estimated point clouds following annotated camera trajectories. However, errors inherent in point cloud estimation often lead to inaccurate anchor videos. Moreover, the requirement for extensive camera trajectory annotations further increases resource demands. To address these limitations, we introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework that automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive camera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor videos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility. This approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory annotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to generate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce Anchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor video guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of backbone model parameters. By combining the proposed anchor video data and ControlNet module, EPiC achieves efficient training with substantially fewer parameters, training steps, and less data, without requiring modifications to the diffusion model backbone typically needed to mitigate rendering misalignments. Although being trained on masking-based anchor videos, our method generalizes robustly to anchor videos made with point clouds during inference, enabling precise 3D-informed camera control. EPiC achieves SOTA performance on RealEstate10K and MiraData for I2V camera control task, demonstrating precise and robust camera control ability both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, EPiC also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to video-to-video scenarios.",

However, existing methods often rely on uniform update rules that fail to consider the heterogeneous nature of point clouds, resulting in excessive and perceptible perturbations. In this paper, we rethink the design of gradient-based attacks by analyzing the limitations of conventional gradient update mechanisms and propose two new strategies to improve both attack effectiveness and imperceptibility. First, we introduce WAAttack, a novel framework that incorporates weighted gradients and an adaptive step-size strategy to account for the non-uniform contribution of points during optimization. This approach enables more targeted and subtle perturbations by dynamically adjusting updates according to the local structure and sensitivity of each point. Second, we propose SubAttack, a complementary strategy that decomposes the point cloud into subsets and focuses perturbation efforts on structurally critical regions. Together, these methods represent a principled rethinking of gradient-based adversarial attacks for 3D point cloud classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating highly imperceptible adversarial examples. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.",

However, existing safe RL paradigms inherently struggle to achieve this objective. We propose a method, called Provably Lifetime Safe RL (PLS), that integrates offline safe RL with safe policy deployment to address this challenge. Our proposed method learns a policy offline using return-conditioned supervised learning and then deploys the resulting policy while cautiously optimizing a limited set of parameters, known as target returns, using Gaussian processes (GPs). Theoretically, we justify the use of GPs by analyzing the mathematical relationship between target and actual returns. We then prove that PLS finds near-optimal target returns while guaranteeing safety with high probability. Empirically, we demonstrate that PLS outperforms baselines both in safety and reward performance, thereby achieving the longstanding goal to obtain high rewards while ensuring the safety of a policy throughout the lifetime from learning to operation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

    "abstract": "Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in general visual reasoning but remain underexplored in Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR), which demands higher-order reasoning to identify abstract rules beyond simple perception. Existing AVR benchmarks focus on single-step reasoning, emphasizing the end result but neglecting the multi-stage nature of reasoning process. Past studies found MLLMs struggle with these benchmarks, but it doesn't explain how they fail. To address this gap, we introduce MultiStAR, a Multi-Stage AVR benchmark, based on RAVEN, designed to assess reasoning across varying levels of complexity. Additionally, existing metrics like accuracy only focus on the final outcomes while do not account for the correctness of intermediate steps. Therefore, we propose a novel metric, MSEval, which considers the correctness of intermediate steps in addition to the final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MultiStAR using 17 representative close-source and open-source MLLMs. The results reveal that while existing MLLMs perform adequately on basic perception tasks, they continue to face challenges in more complex rule detection stages.",

    "abstract": "Traditional search engines struggle to synthesize fragmented information for complex queries, while generative AI search engines face challenges in relevance, comprehensiveness, and presentation. To address these limitations, we introduce Xinyu AI Search, a novel system that incorporates a query-decomposition graph to dynamically break down complex queries into sub-queries, enabling stepwise retrieval and generation. Our retrieval pipeline enhances diversity through multi-source aggregation and query expansion, while filtering and re-ranking strategies optimize passage relevance. Additionally, Xinyu AI Search introduces a novel approach for fine-grained, precise built-in citation and innovates in result presentation by integrating timeline visualization and textual-visual choreography. Evaluated on recent real-world queries, Xinyu AI Search outperforms eight existing technologies in human assessments, excelling in relevance, comprehensiveness, and insightfulness. Ablation studies validate the necessity of its key sub-modules. Our work presents the first comprehensive framework for generative AI search engines, bridging retrieval, generation, and user-centric presentation.",

    "abstract": "We reveal that feedforward network (FFN) layers, rather than attention layers, are the primary contributors to Vision Transformer (ViT) inference latency, with their impact signifying as model size increases. This finding highlights a critical opportunity for optimizing the efficiency of large-scale ViTs by focusing on FFN layers. In this work, we propose a novel channel idle mechanism that facilitates post-training structural reparameterization for efficient FFN layers during testing. Specifically, a set of feature channels remains idle and bypasses the nonlinear activation function in each FFN layer, thereby forming a linear pathway that enables structural reparameterization during inference. This mechanism results in a family of ReParameterizable Vision Transformers (RePaViTs), which achieve remarkable latency reductions with acceptable sacrifices (sometimes gains) in accuracy across various ViTs. The benefits of our method scale consistently with model sizes, demonstrating greater speed improvements and progressively narrowing accuracy gaps or even higher accuracies on larger models. In particular, RePa-ViT-Large and RePa-ViT-Huge enjoy 66.8% and 68.7% speed-ups with +1.7% and +1.1% higher top-1 accuracies under the same training strategy, respectively. RePaViT is the first to employ structural reparameterization on FFN layers to expedite ViTs to our best knowledge, and we believe that it represents an auspicious direction for efficient ViTs.

    "abstract": "Online safe reinforcement learning (RL) plays a key role in dynamic environments, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and cybersecurity. The objective is to learn optimal policies that maximize rewards while satisfying safety constraints modeled by constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). Existing methods achieve sublinear regret under stochastic constraints but often fail in adversarial settings, where constraints are unknown, time-varying, and potentially adversarially designed. In this paper, we propose the Optimistic Mirror Descent Primal-Dual (OMDPD) algorithm, the first to address online CMDPs with anytime adversarial constraints. OMDPD achieves optimal regret O(sqrt(K)) and strong constraint violation O(sqrt(K)) without relying on Slater's condition or the existence of a strictly known safe policy. We further show that access to accurate estimates of rewards and transitions can further improve these bounds. Our results offer practical guarantees for safe decision-making in adversarial environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the robust output regulation problem of second-order nonlinear uncertain systems with an unknown exosystem. Instead of the adaptive control approach, this paper resorts to a robust control methodology to solve the problem and thus avoid the bursting phenomenon. In particular, this paper constructs generic internal models for the steady-state state and input variables of the system. By introducing a coordinate transformation, this paper converts the robust output regulation problem into a nonadaptive stabilization problem of an augmented system composed of the second-order nonlinear uncertain system and the generic internal models. Then, we design the stabilization control law and construct a strict Lyapunov function that guarantees the robustness with respect to unmodeled disturbances. The analysis shows that the output zeroing manifold of the augmented system can be made attractive by the proposed nonadaptive control law, which solves the robust output regulation problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonadaptive internal model approach by its application to the control of the Duffing system.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of electronic and electrical engineering, automation of analog\ncircuit is increasingly vital given the complexity and customized requirements\nof modern applications. However, existing methods only develop search-based\nalgorithms that require many simulation iterations to design a custom circuit\ntopology, which is usually a time-consuming process. To this end, we introduce\nLaMAGIC, a pioneering language model-based topology generation model that\nleverages supervised finetuning for automated analog circuit design. LaMAGIC\ncan efficiently generate an optimized circuit design from the custom\nspecification in a single pass. Our approach involves a meticulous development\nand analysis of various input and output formulations for circuit. These\nformulations can ensure canonical representations of circuits and align with\nthe autoregressive nature of LMs to effectively addressing the challenges of\nrepresenting analog circuits as graphs. The experimental results show that\nLaMAGIC achieves a success rate of up to 96\\% under a strict tolerance of 0.01.\nWe also examine the scalability and adaptability of LaMAGIC, specifically\ntesting its performance on more complex circuits. Our findings reveal the\nenhanced effectiveness of our adjacency matrix-based circuit formulation with\nfloating-point input, suggesting its suitability for handling intricate circuit\ndesigns. This research not only demonstrates the potential of language models\nin graph generation, but also builds a foundational framework for future\nexplorations in automated analog circuit design.",

How do these\nbehaviors persist and generalize when the caregiver is no longer present, and\nthe learner must continue autonomously? Here, we propose a model of value\ninternalization where social feedback trains an internal social reward (ISR)\nmodel that generates internal rewards when social rewards are unavailable.\nThrough empirical simulations, we show that an ISR model prevents agents from\nunlearning socialized behaviors and enables generalization in\nout-of-distribution tasks.

In this paper, we investigate if pruning an existing LLM and\nthen re-training it with a fraction (<3%) of the original training data can be\na suitable alternative to repeated, full retraining. To this end, we develop a\nset of practical and effective compression best practices for LLMs that combine\ndepth, width, attention and MLP pruning with knowledge distillation-based\nretraining; we arrive at these best practices through a detailed empirical\nexploration of pruning strategies for each axis, methods to combine axes,\ndistillation strategies, and search techniques for arriving at optimal\ncompressed architectures. We use this guide to compress the Nemotron-4 family\nof LLMs by a factor of 2-4x, and compare their performance to similarly-sized\nmodels on a variety of language modeling tasks. Deriving 8B and 4B models from\nan already pretrained 15B model using our approach requires up to 40x fewer\ntraining tokens per model compared to training from scratch; this results in\ncompute cost savings of 1.8x for training the full model family (15B, 8B, and\n4B). Minitron models exhibit up to a 16% improvement in MMLU scores compared to\ntraining from scratch, perform comparably to other community models such as\nMistral 7B, Gemma 7B and Llama-3 8B, and outperform state-of-the-art\ncompression techniques from the literature.

For\nexample, in cybersecurity applications, the cost of not detecting an attack is\nvery different from marking a benign activity as an attack. Various design\nchoices during machine learning model building, such as hyperparameter tuning\nand model selection, allow a data scientist to trade-off between these two\nerrors. However, most of the commonly used metrics to evaluate model quality,\nsuch as $F_1$ score, which is defined in terms of model precision and recall,\ntreat both these errors equally, making it difficult for users to optimize for\nthe actual cost of these errors.

It includes a cost ratio that takes into\naccount the differing costs of handling false positives and false negatives.

    "abstract": "Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their\nimpressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these\nmodels are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing\nhigh-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging\ntasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the\ninherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex\nboundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent\nfoundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even\nfailure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\npretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder\n(Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined\nwith adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively\nrepresent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings.\nAdditionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking\nstrategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other\narchitectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop\nFrepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for\nboth 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform\nother self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses\ntask-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for\ntasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase\nin DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule\ndetection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables\nsuperior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings,\nunderscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal\nmedical image foundation models.",

While previous\nworks have proposed Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to bridge the train-test domain\ngap by refining network parameters at inference, the absence of ground-truth\nannotations makes it highly challenging and existing methods typically increase\ninference times by one or more orders of magnitude. We observe that 1) not\nevery test time sample is OOD, and 2) HPE errors are significantly larger on\ndistal keypoints (wrist, ankle). To this end, we propose ESCAPE: a lightweight\ncorrection and selective adaptation framework which applies a fast,\nforward-pass correction on most data while reserving costly TTA for OOD data.\nThe free energy function is introduced to separate OOD samples from incoming\ndata and a correction network is trained to estimate the errors of pretrained\nbackbone HPE predictions on the distal keypoints. For OOD samples, we propose a\nnovel self-consistency adaptation loss to update the correction network by\nleveraging the constraining relationship between distal keypoints and proximal\nkeypoints (shoulders, hips), via a second ``reverse\" network. ESCAPE improves\nthe distal MPJPE of five popular HPE models by up to 7% on unseen data,\nachieves state-of-the-art results on two popular HPE benchmarks, and is\nsignificantly faster than existing adaptation methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for\ndomain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field\nof scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual\ninstruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer\n(QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the\nfundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and\ndigital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract\nunderlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by\nexploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of\ncharts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in\nalignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2)\nReplacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end\nfine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation\nskills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and\nthen answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy.\nConsequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart\ncomprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts,\nincluding unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities.\nFurthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of\ndifferent chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results\nshow that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated\nand unannotated charts across a wide range of types.",

Such models typically require first coming up with a set of\nconcepts relevant to the task and then aligning the representations of a\nfeature extractor to map to these concepts. However, even with powerful\nfoundational feature extractors like CLIP, there are no guarantees that the\nspecified concepts are detectable. In this work, we leverage recent advances in\nmechanistic interpretability and propose a novel CBM approach -- called\nDiscover-then-Name-CBM (DN-CBM) -- that inverts the typical paradigm: instead\nof pre-selecting concepts based on the downstream classification task, we use\nsparse autoencoders to first discover concepts learnt by the model, and then\nname them and train linear probes for classification. Our concept extraction\nstrategy is efficient, since it is agnostic to the downstream task, and uses\nconcepts already known to the model. We perform a comprehensive evaluation\nacross multiple datasets and CLIP architectures and show that our method yields\nsemantically meaningful concepts, assigns appropriate names to them that make\nthem easy to interpret, and yields performant and interpretable CBMs. Code\navailable at https://github.com/neuroexplicit-saar/discover-then-name.",

Hence,\nquantitative researchers are looking for alternative models to tackle this\nproblem. Concretely, portfolio management is a problem that has been\nsuccessfully addressed recently by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\napproaches. In particular, DRL algorithms train an agent by estimating the\ndistribution of the expected reward of every action performed by an agent given\nany financial state in a simulator. However, these methods rely on Deep Neural\nNetworks model to represent such a distribution, that although they are\nuniversal approximator models, they cannot explain its behaviour, given by a\nset of parameters that are not interpretable. Critically, financial investors\npolicies require predictions to be interpretable, so DRL agents are not suited\nto follow a particular policy or explain their actions. In this work, we\ndeveloped a novel Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL) approach for\nportfolio management, integrating the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with\nthe model agnostic explainable techniques of feature importance, SHAP and LIME\nto enhance transparency in prediction time. By executing our methodology, we\ncan interpret in prediction time the actions of the agent to assess whether\nthey follow the requisites of an investment policy or to assess the risk of\nfollowing the agent suggestions. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed\napproach is the first explainable post hoc portfolio management financial\npolicy of a DRL agent.

While System-2 is\ntypically more effective, it is also more computationally expensive, making it\ninfeasible for long plans or large action spaces. Moreover, isolated System-1\nor 2 ignores the user's end goals, failing to provide ways to control the\nmodel's behavior. To this end, we propose the System-1.x Planner, a\ncontrollable planning framework with LLMs that is capable of generating hybrid\nplans and balancing between the two planning modes based on the difficulty of\nthe problem at hand.

Based on a user-specified hybridization\nfactor (x) governing the mixture between System-1 and 2, the controller\ndecomposes a problem into sub-goals, and classifies them as easy or hard to be\nsolved by either System-1 or 2, respectively. We fine-tune all three components\non top of a single base LLM, requiring only search traces as supervision.\nExperiments with two diverse planning tasks -- Maze Navigation and Blocksworld\n-- show that our System-1.x Planner outperforms a System-1 Planner, a System-2\nPlanner trained to approximate A* search, and also a symbolic planner (A*).

The simulation results show that DeepAR\nestimators predict the PRBs with less uncertainty and effectively capture the\ntemporal dependencies in the dataset compared to SFF- and Transformer-based\nmodels, leading to power savings. Different percentile selections can also\nincrease power savings, but at the cost of over-/under provisioning.

    "abstract": "Extensive research in the field of ontology-based query answering has led to\nthe identification of numerous fragments of existential rules (also known as\ntuple-generating dependencies) that exhibit decidable answering of atomic and\nconjunctive queries. Motivated by the increased theoretical and practical\ninterest in navigational queries, this paper considers the question for which\nof these fragments decidability of querying extends to regular path queries\n(RPQs). In fact, decidability of RPQs has recently been shown to generally hold\nfor the comprehensive family of all fragments that come with the guarantee of\nuniversal models being reasonably well-shaped (that is, being of finite\ncliquewidth). Yet, for the second major family of fragments, known as finite\nunification sets (short: fus), which are based on first-order-rewritability,\ncorresponding results have been largely elusive so far. We complete the picture\nby showing that RPQ answering over arbitrary fus rulesets is undecidable. On\nthe positive side, we establish that the problem is decidable for the prominent\nfus subclass of sticky rulesets, with the caveat that a very mild extension of\nthe RPQ formalism turns the problem undecidable again.",

Technologies such as Open\nRadio Access Network (O-RAN) can help to build interoperable solutions for the\nmanagement of complex systems. Probabilistic forecasting, in contrast to\ndeterministic single-point estimators, can offer a different approach to\nresource allocation by quantifying the uncertainty of the generated\npredictions. This paper examines the cloud-native aspects of O-RAN together\nwith the radio App (rApp) deployment options. The integration of probabilistic\nforecasting techniques as a rApp in O-RAN is also emphasized, along with case\nstudies of real-world applications. Through a comparative analysis of\nforecasting models using the error metric, we show the advantages of Deep\nAutoregressive Recurrent network (DeepAR) over other deterministic\nprobabilistic estimators. Furthermore, the simplicity of Simple-Feed-Forward\n(SFF) leads to a fast runtime but does not capture the temporal dependencies of\nthe input data.

    "abstract": "This research investigates whether OpenAI's GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large\nlanguage model, can accurately classify the political bias of news sources\nbased solely on their URLs. Given the subjective nature of political labels,\nthird-party bias ratings like those from Ad Fontes Media, AllSides, and Media\nBias/Fact Check (MBFC) are often used in research to analyze news source\ndiversity. This study aims to determine if GPT-4 can replicate these human\nratings on a seven-degree scale (\"far-left\" to \"far-right\"). The analysis\ncompares GPT-4's classifications against MBFC's, and controls for website\npopularity using Open PageRank scores. Findings reveal a high correlation\n($\\text{Spearman's } \\rho = .89$, $n = 5,877$, $p < 0.001$) between GPT-4's and\nMBFC's ratings, indicating the model's potential reliability. However, GPT-4\nabstained from classifying approximately $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the dataset. It is\nmore likely to abstain from rating unpopular websites, which also suffer from\nless accurate assessments. The LLM tends to avoid classifying sources that MBFC\nconsiders to be centrist, resulting in more polarized outputs. Finally, this\nanalysis shows a slight leftward skew in GPT's classifications compared to\nMBFC's. Therefore, while this paper suggests that while GPT-4 can be a\nscalable, cost-effective tool for political bias classification of news\nwebsites, its use should be as a complement to human judgment to mitigate\nbiases.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual code-switching research is often hindered by the lack and\nlinguistically biased status of available datasets. To expand language\nrepresentation, we synthesize code-switching data by replacing intonation units\ndetected through PSST, a speech segmentation model fine-tuned from OpenAI's\nWhisper, using a speech-to-text translation dataset, CoVoST 2. With our\ndataset, CoVoSwitch, spanning 13 languages, we evaluate the code-switching\ntranslation performance of two multilingual translation models, M2M-100 418M\nand NLLB-200 600M. We reveal that the inclusion of code-switching units results\nin higher translation performance than monolingual settings and that models are\nbetter at code-switching translation into English than non-English. Further,\nlow-resource languages gain most from integration of code-switched units when\ntranslating into English but much less when translating into non-English.\nTranslations into low-resource languages also perform worse than even raw\ncode-switched inputs. We find that systems excel at copying English tokens but\nstruggle with non-English tokens, that the off-target problem in monolingual\nsettings is also relevant in code-switching settings, and that models\nhallucinate in code-switching translation by introducing words absent in both\nof the original source sentences.

Our goal is to understand how operations in the latent space\naffect the underlying concepts. To that end, we explore the task of concept\nblending through diffusion models.

Research has shown that individual parameters with varying low\nprecision, can attain accuracies comparable to full-precision counterparts.\nHowever, modern embedded microprocessors provide very limited support for\nmixed-precision NNs regarding both Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)\nextensions and their hardware design for efficient execution of mixed-precision\noperations, i.e., introducing several performance bottlenecks due to numerous\ninstructions for data packing and unpacking, arithmetic unit under-utilizations\netc. In this work, we bring together, for the first time, ISA extensions\ntailored to mixed-precision hardware optimizations, targeting energy-efficient\nDNN inference on leading RISC-V CPU architectures. To this end, we introduce a\nhardware-software co-design framework that enables cooperative hardware design,\nmixed-precision quantization, ISA extensions and inference in cycle-accurate\nemulations. At hardware level, we firstly expand the ALU unit within our\nproof-of-concept micro-architecture to support configurable fine grained\nmixed-precision arithmetic operations.

At the ISA level, three distinct MAC instructions\nare encoded extending the RISC-V ISA, and exposed up to the compiler level,\neach corresponding to a different mixed-precision operational mode. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation over widely used DNNs and datasets, such as\nCIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our framework can achieve, on average,\n15x energy reduction for less than 1% accuracy loss and outperforms the\nISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores.",

These\nLLM-enhanced methodologies excel in generalization and interpretability.\nHowever, the complexity of driving tasks often necessitates the collaboration\nof multiple, heterogeneous agents, underscoring the need for such LLM-driven\nagents to engage in cooperative knowledge sharing and cognitive synergy.\nDespite the promise of LLMs, current applications predominantly center around\nsingle agent scenarios. To broaden the horizons of knowledge-driven strategies\nand bolster the generalization capabilities of autonomous agents, we propose\nthe KoMA framework consisting of multi-agent interaction, multi-step planning,\nshared-memory, and ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agents'\ndecision-making in complex driving scenarios. Based on the framework's\ngenerated text descriptions of driving scenarios, the multi-agent interaction\nmodule enables LLM agents to analyze and infer the intentions of surrounding\nvehicles, akin to human cognition. The multi-step planning module enables LLM\nagents to analyze and obtain final action decisions layer by layer to ensure\nconsistent goals for short-term action decisions. The shared memory module can\naccumulate collective experience to make superior decisions, and the\nranking-based reflection module can evaluate and improve agent behavior with\nthe aim of enhancing driving safety and efficiency. The KoMA framework not only\nenhances the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving agents but also\nsignificantly elevates their generalization capabilities across diverse\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "In recent work, Lissovoi, Oliveto, and Warwicker (Artificial Intelligence\n(2023)) proved that the Move Acceptance Hyper-Heuristic (MAHH) leaves the local\noptimum of the multimodal CLIFF benchmark with remarkable efficiency. The\n$O(n^3)$ runtime of the MAHH, for almost all cliff widths $d\\ge 2,$ is\nsignificantly better than the $\\Theta(n^d)$ runtime of simple elitist\nevolutionary algorithms (EAs) on CLIFF.\n  In this work, we first show that this advantage is specific to the CLIFF\nproblem and does not extend to the JUMP benchmark, the most prominent\nmulti-modal benchmark in the theory of randomized search heuristics. We prove\nthat for any choice of the MAHH selection parameter $p$, the expected runtime\nof the MAHH on a JUMP function with gap size $m = O(n^{1/2})$ is at least\n$\\Omega(n^{2m-1} / (2m-1)!)$. This is significantly slower than the $O(n^m)$\nruntime of simple elitist EAs. Encouragingly, we also show that replacing the\nlocal one-bit mutation operator in the MAHH with the global bit-wise mutation\noperator, commonly used in EAs, yields a runtime of $\\min\\{1,\nO(\\frac{e\\ln(n)}{m})^m\\} \\, O(n^m)$ on JUMP functions. This is at least as good\nas the runtime of simple elitist EAs. For larger values of $m$, this result\nproves an asymptotic performance gain over simple EAs. As our proofs reveal,\nthe MAHH profits from its ability to walk through the valley of lower objective\nvalues in moderate-size steps, always accepting inferior solutions. This is the\nfirst time that such an optimization behavior is proven via mathematical means.\nGenerally, our result shows that combining two ways of coping with local\noptima, global mutation and accepting inferior solutions, can lead to\nconsiderable performance gains.",

In this\npaper, we propose PassTSL (modeling human-created Passwords through Two-Stage\nLearning), inspired by the popular pretraining-finetuning framework in NLP and\ndeep learning (DL). We report how different pretraining settings affected\nPassTSL and proved its effectiveness by applying it to six large leaked\npassword databases. Experimental results showed that it outperforms five\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) password cracking methods on password guessing by a\nsignificant margin ranging from 4.11% to 64.69% at the maximum point. Based on\nPassTSL, we also implemented a password strength meter (PSM), and our\nexperiments showed that it was able to estimate password strength more\naccurately, causing fewer unsafe errors (overestimating the password strength)\nthan two other SOTA PSMs when they produce the same rate of safe errors\n(underestimating the password strength): a neural-network based method and\nzxcvbn. Furthermore, we explored multiple finetuning settings, and our\nevaluations showed that, even a small amount of additional training data, e.g.,\nonly 0.1% of the pretrained data, can lead to over 3% improvement in password\nguessing on average. We also proposed a heuristic approach to selecting\nfinetuning passwords based on JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergence and experimental\nresults validated its usefulness. In summary, our contributions demonstrate the\npotential and feasibility of applying advanced NLP and ML methods to password\nmodeling and cracking.",

In light of these issues, we propose\na simple yet effective approach for EEG data pre-processing. Our method first\ntransforms the EEG data into an encoded image by an Inverted Channel-wise\nMagnitude Homogenization (ICWMH) to mitigate inter-channel biases. Next, we\napply the edge detection technique on the EEG-encoded image combined with skip\nconnection to emphasize the most significant transitions in the data while\npreserving structural and invariant information. By doing so, we can improve\nthe EEG learning process efficiently without using a huge DL network.

Analyzing AI incidents through a D&I lens is crucial for identifying\ncauses of biases and developing strategies to mitigate them, ensuring fairer\nand more equitable AI technologies. However, systematic investigations of\nD&I-related AI incidents are scarce. This study addresses these challenges by\nidentifying and understanding D&I issues within AI systems through a manual\nanalysis of AI incident databases (AIID and AIAAIC). The research develops a\ndecision tree to investigate D&I issues tied to AI incidents and populate a\npublic repository of D&I-related AI incidents. The decision tree was validated\nthrough a card sorting exercise and focus group discussions. The research\ndemonstrates that almost half of the analyzed AI incidents are related to D&I,\nwith a notable predominance of racial, gender, and age discrimination.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have achieved remarkable\nsuccess across various domains, yet challenges persist in two critical areas:\nensuring robustness against uncertain inputs and drastically increasing model\nefficiency during training and inference. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs),\ninspired by biological systems, offer a promising avenue for overcoming these\nlimitations. By operating in an event-driven manner, SNNs achieve low energy\nconsumption and can naturally implement biological methods known for their high\nnoise tolerance. In this work, we explore the potential of the spiking\nForward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) to address these challenges, leveraging its\nrepresentational properties for both Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and\ninterpretability. To achieve this, we exploit the sparse and highly specialized\nneural latent space of FF networks to estimate the likelihood of a sample\nbelonging to the training distribution. Additionally, we propose a novel,\ngradient-free attribution method to detect features that drive a sample away\nfrom class distributions, addressing the challenges posed by the lack of\ngradients in most visual interpretability methods for spiking models. We\nevaluate our OoD detection algorithm on well-known image datasets (e.g.,\nOmniglot, Not-MNIST, CIFAR10), outperforming previous methods proposed in the\nrecent literature for OoD detection in spiking networks. Furthermore, our\nattribution method precisely identifies salient OoD features, such as artifacts\nor missing regions, hence providing a visual explanatory interface for the user\nto understand why unknown inputs are identified as such by the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in\nthe last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge\ndevices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing\nsparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with\nsparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of\ndual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix\nmultiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on\nexisting spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that\nprocessing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to\nANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the\nproblem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes\nboth data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse\nSNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly\nspike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and\nensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join\ncircuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with\nalmost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are\nencapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs.\nWith FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN\nworkloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\\times$) and\nenergy reduction (up to $3.68\\times$) compared to running it on prior\ndual-sparse accelerators.",

    "abstract": "The inference of transformer-based large language models consists of two\nsequential stages: 1) a prefilling stage to compute the KV cache of prompts and\ngenerate the first token, and 2) a decoding stage to generate subsequent\ntokens. For long prompts, the KV cache must be computed for all tokens during\nthe prefilling stage, which can significantly increase the time needed to\ngenerate the first token. Consequently, the prefilling stage may become a\nbottleneck in the generation process. An open question remains whether all\nprompt tokens are essential for generating the first token. To answer this, we\nintroduce a novel method, LazyLLM, that selectively computes the KV for tokens\nimportant for the next token prediction in both the prefilling and decoding\nstages. Contrary to static pruning approaches that prune the prompt at once,\nLazyLLM allows language models to dynamically select different subsets of\ntokens from the context in different generation steps, even though they might\nbe pruned in previous steps. Extensive experiments on standard datasets across\nvarious tasks demonstrate that LazyLLM is a generic method that can be\nseamlessly integrated with existing language models to significantly accelerate\nthe generation without fine-tuning. For instance, in the multi-document\nquestion-answering task, LazyLLM accelerates the prefilling stage of the LLama\n2 7B model by 2.34x while maintaining accuracy.",

    "abstract": "When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first\nconsiderations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself.\nConventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the\n``quantisation\" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear\nalgebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the\nentire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible\nrun-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research\nhas started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal\nfor quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit\nproperties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality,\nto better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an\nalternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences\nfrom the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum\nneural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading\ncircuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through\nnumerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and\nFashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum\nconvolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on\nMNIST test set).

    "abstract": "Graphs are pervasive in the real-world, such as social network analysis,\nbioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have great\nability in node classification, a fundamental task on graphs. Unfortunately,\nconventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes,\ndespite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world\napplications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed,\nincluding graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer\nlearning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to\nexploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based\nmethods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the\nquality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that\nintegrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm\nto enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with\nconsiderably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by\nsignificant margins.",

    "abstract": "Efficient order fulfillment is vital in the agricultural industry,\nparticularly due to the seasonal nature of seed supply chains. This paper\naddresses the challenge of optimizing seed orders fulfillment in a centralized\nwarehouse where orders are processed in waves, taking into account the\nunpredictable arrival of seed stocks and strict order deadlines. We model the\nwave scheduling problem as a Markov decision process and propose an adaptive\nhybrid tree search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo tree search with\ndomain-specific knowledge to efficiently navigate the complex, dynamic\nenvironment of seed distribution. By leveraging historical data and stochastic\nmodeling, our method enables forecast-informed scheduling decisions that\nbalance immediate requirements with long-term operational efficiency. The key\nidea is that we can augment Monte Carlo tree search algorithm with\nproblem-specific side information that dynamically reduces the number of\ncandidate actions at each decision step to handle the large state and action\nspaces that render traditional solution methods computationally intractable.\nExtensive simulations with realistic parameters-including a diverse range of\nproducts, a high volume of orders, and authentic seasonal durations-demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing industry standard\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Despite its breakthrough in classification problems, Knowledge distillation\n(KD) to recommendation models and ranking problems has not been studied well in\nthe previous literature. This dissertation is devoted to developing knowledge\ndistillation methods for recommender systems to fully improve the performance\nof a compact model. We propose novel distillation methods designed for\nrecommender systems. The proposed methods are categorized according to their\nknowledge sources as follows: (1) Latent knowledge: we propose two methods that\ntransfer latent knowledge of user/item representation. They effectively\ntransfer knowledge of niche tastes with a balanced distillation strategy that\nprevents the KD process from being biased towards a small number of large\npreference groups. Also, we propose a new method that transfers user/item\nrelations in the representation space. The proposed method selectively\ntransfers essential relations considering the limited capacity of the compact\nmodel. (2) Ranking knowledge: we propose three methods that transfer ranking\nknowledge from the recommendation results. They formulate the KD process as a\nranking matching problem and transfer the knowledge via a listwise learning\nstrategy. Further, we present a new learning framework that compresses the\nranking knowledge of heterogeneous recommendation models. The proposed\nframework is developed to ease the computational burdens of model ensemble\nwhich is a dominant solution for many recommendation applications. We validate\nthe benefit of our proposed methods and frameworks through extensive\nexperiments. To summarize, this dissertation sheds light on knowledge\ndistillation approaches for a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off of the\nrecommendation models.",

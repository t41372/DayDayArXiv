    "abstract": "Recent attention to relational knowledge bases has sparked a demand for\nunderstanding how relations change between entities. Petri nets can represent\nknowledge structure and dynamically simulate interactions between entities, and\nthus they are well suited for achieving this goal. However, logic programs\nstruggle to deal with extensive Petri nets due to the limitations of high-level\nsymbol manipulations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach\ncalled Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP), utilising boolean matrices as\nan alternative computation mechanism for Prolog to evaluate logic programs.\nWithin this framework, we propose two novel BMLP algorithms for simulating a\nclass of Petri nets known as elementary nets. This is done by transforming\nelementary nets into logically equivalent datalog programs. We demonstrate\nempirically that BMLP algorithms can evaluate these programs 40 times faster\nthan tabled B-Prolog, SWI-Prolog, XSB-Prolog and Clingo. Our work enables the\nefficient simulation of elementary nets using Prolog, expanding the scope of\nanalysis, learning and verification of complex systems with logic programming\ntechniques.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce a new approach to code generation tasks leveraging multi-agent\nprompting that uniquely replicates the full cycle of program synthesis as\nobserved in human developers.

Our contribution lies in proposing potential\ncomputational pathways for engineering antifragility, grounding the concept in\nonline learning theory and drawing connections to recent advancements in areas\nsuch as meta-learning, safe exploration, continual learning,\nmulti-objective/quality-diversity optimization, and foundation models.

Recently,\nSpatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme\nof MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal\ndependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical\ndata integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and\ntime-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole\nhistorical observations without missing any variable.

To address the problem, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR)\nto precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected\ndata for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is,\ninterpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the\nfully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of\nrecovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct\nspatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time\nseries data, respectively.

The proposed framework is designed to 1. maximize the\ntraffic flow and 2. minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion\ndynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and enhance the ultra-reliable\nlow-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this\nproblem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop\nsolutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting\nobjectives. Specifically, deep-Q-network and double deep-Q-network-based\nsolutions are developed first that consider scalarizing the transportation and\ntelecommunication rewards using predefined preferences. We then develop a novel\nenvelope MORL solution which develop policies that address multiple objectives\nwith unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on\nscalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a\nchallenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman\nequation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn\na unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies\nacross all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning\nphase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or\ninfer preferences from minimal data samples.Numerical results validate the\nefficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting\ninsights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and\nthe communication data rate.

However, according to the results of Kolmogorov\nand Vitushkin, the representation of generic smooth functions by KAN\nimplementations using analytic functions constrained to a finite number of\ncutoff points cannot be exact. Hence, the convergence of KAN throughout the\ntraining process may be limited. This paper explores the relevance of\nsmoothness in KANs, proposing that smooth, structurally informed KANs can\nachieve equivalence to MLPs in specific function classes.

To advance the dialectic, I challenge this argument with an updated\nRubin causal model that retains its successes while dispensing with CEM. This\nnovel approach combines the strengths of the Rubin causal model and a causal\nmodel familiar in philosophy, the causal Bayes net.

Recent analyses\nrecommended routing dialectal samples to native speakers of their respective\ndialects to build higher-quality datasets. However, automatically identifying\nthe dialect of samples is hard. Moreover, the pool of annotators who are native\nspeakers of specific Arabic dialects might be scarce. Arabic Level of\nDialectness (ALDi) was recently introduced as a quantitative variable that\nmeasures how sentences diverge from Standard Arabic. On randomly assigning\nsamples to annotators, we hypothesize that samples of higher ALDi scores are\nharder to label especially if they are written in dialects that the annotators\ndo not speak. We test this by analyzing the relation between ALDi scores and\nthe annotators' agreement, on 15 public datasets having raw individual sample\nannotations for various sentence-classification tasks. We find strong evidence\nsupporting our hypothesis for 11 of them. Consequently, we recommend\nprioritizing routing samples of high ALDi scores to native speakers of each\nsample's dialect, for which the dialect could be automatically identified at\nhigher accuracies.",

Although the Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) architecture has been employed to efficiently scale large language and\nimage-text models, these efforts typically involve fewer experts and limited\nmodalities. To address this, our work presents the pioneering attempt to\ndevelop a unified MLLM with the MoE architecture, named Uni-MoE that can handle\na wide array of modalities. Specifically, it features modality-specific\nencoders with connectors for a unified multimodal representation. We also\nimplement a sparse MoE architecture within the LLMs to enable efficient\ntraining and inference through modality-level data parallelism and expert-level\nmodel parallelism. To enhance the multi-expert collaboration and\ngeneralization, we present a progressive training strategy: 1) Cross-modality\nalignment using various connectors with different cross-modality data, 2)\nTraining modality-specific experts with cross-modality instruction data to\nactivate experts' preferences, and 3) Tuning the Uni-MoE framework utilizing\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on mixed multimodal instruction data. We evaluate\nthe instruction-tuned Uni-MoE on a comprehensive set of multimodal datasets.\nThe extensive experimental results demonstrate Uni-MoE's principal advantage of\nsignificantly reducing performance bias in handling mixed multimodal datasets,\nalongside improved multi-expert collaboration and generalization.

    "abstract": "As its availability and generality in online services, implicit feedback is\nmore commonly used in recommender systems. However, implicit feedback usually\npresents noisy samples in real-world recommendation scenarios (such as\nmisclicks or non-preferential behaviors), which will affect precise user\npreference learning. To overcome the noisy samples problem, a popular solution\nis based on dropping noisy samples in the model training phase, which follows\nthe observation that noisy samples have higher training losses than clean\nsamples. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that this solution still has\nlimits. (1) High training losses can result from model optimization instability\nor hard samples, not just noisy samples. (2) Completely dropping of noisy\nsamples will aggravate the data sparsity, which lacks full data exploitation.\nTo tackle the above limitations, we propose a Double Correction Framework for\nDenoising Recommendation (DCF), which contains two correction components from\nviews of more precise sample dropping and avoiding more sparse data. In the\nsample dropping correction component, we use the loss value of the samples over\ntime to determine whether it is noise or not, increasing dropping stability.\nInstead of averaging directly, we use the damping function to reduce the bias\neffect of outliers. Furthermore, due to the higher variance exhibited by hard\nsamples, we derive a lower bound for the loss through concentration inequality\nto identify and reuse hard samples. In progressive label correction, we\niteratively re-label highly deterministic noisy samples and retrain them to\nfurther improve performance. Finally, extensive experimental results on three\ndatasets and four backbones demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of\nour proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Column generation (CG) is a well-established method for solving large-scale\nlinear programs. It involves iteratively optimizing a subproblem containing a\nsubset of columns and using its dual solution to generate new columns with\nnegative reduced costs. This process continues until the dual values converge\nto the optimal dual solution to the original problem. A natural phenomenon in\nCG is the heavy oscillation of the dual values during iterations, which can\nlead to a substantial slowdown in the convergence rate. Stabilization\ntechniques are devised to accelerate the convergence of dual values by using\ninformation beyond the state of the current subproblem. However, there remains\na significant gap in obtaining more accurate dual values at an earlier stage.\nTo further narrow this gap, this paper introduces a novel approach consisting\nof 1) a machine learning approach for accurate prediction of optimal dual\nsolutions and 2) an adaptive stabilization technique that effectively\ncapitalizes on accurate predictions. On the graph coloring problem, we show\nthat our method achieves a significantly improved convergence rate compared to\ntraditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactuals, or modified inputs that lead to a different outcome, are an\nimportant tool for understanding the logic used by machine learning classifiers\nand how to change an undesirable classification. Even if a counterfactual\nchanges a classifier's decision, however, it may not affect the true underlying\nclass probabilities, i.e. the counterfactual may act like an adversarial attack\nand ``fool'' the classifier. We propose a new framework for creating modified\ninputs that change the true underlying probabilities in a beneficial way which\nwe call Trustworthy Actionable Perturbations (TAP). This includes a novel\nverification procedure to ensure that TAP change the true class probabilities\ninstead of acting adversarially. Our framework also includes new cost, reward,\nand goal definitions that are better suited to effectuating change in the real\nworld. We present PAC-learnability results for our verification procedure and\ntheoretically analyze our new method for measuring reward. We also develop a\nmethodology for creating TAP and compare our results to those achieved by\nprevious counterfactual methods.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of internet communication and telemedicine, people are\nincreasingly turning to the web for various healthcare activities. With an\never-increasing number of diseases and symptoms, diagnosing patients becomes\nchallenging. In this work, we build a diagnosis assistant to assist doctors,\nwhich identifies diseases based on patient-doctor interaction. During\ndiagnosis, doctors utilize both symptomatology knowledge and diagnostic\nexperience to identify diseases accurately and efficiently. Inspired by this,\nwe investigate the role of medical knowledge in disease diagnosis through\ndoctor-patient interaction. We propose a two-channel, knowledge-infused,\ndiscourse-aware disease diagnosis model (KI-DDI), where the first channel\nencodes patient-doctor communication using a transformer-based encoder, while\nthe other creates an embedding of symptom-disease using a graph attention\nnetwork (GAT). In the next stage, the conversation and knowledge graph\nembeddings are infused together and fed to a deep neural network for disease\nidentification. Furthermore, we first develop an empathetic conversational\nmedical corpus comprising conversations between patients and doctors, annotated\nwith intent and symptoms information. The proposed model demonstrates a\nsignificant improvement over the existing state-of-the-art models, establishing\nthe crucial roles of (a) a doctor's effort for additional symptom extraction\n(in addition to patient self-report) and (b) infusing medical knowledge in\nidentifying diseases effectively. Many times, patients also show their medical\nconditions, which acts as crucial evidence in diagnosis. Therefore, integrating\nvisual sensory information would represent an effective avenue for enhancing\nthe capabilities of diagnostic assistants.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the vulnerability of large-scale pre-trained vision-language\nmodels like CLIP against adversarial attacks is key to ensuring zero-shot\ngeneralization capacity on various downstream tasks. State-of-the-art defense\nmechanisms generally adopt prompt learning strategies for adversarial\nfine-tuning to improve the adversarial robustness of the pre-trained model\nwhile keeping the efficiency of adapting to downstream tasks. Such a setup\nleads to the problem of over-fitting which impedes further improvement of the\nmodel's generalization capacity on both clean and adversarial examples. In this\nwork, we propose an adaptive Consistency-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning\n(i.e., CAPT) framework that utilizes multi-modal prompt learning to enhance the\nalignment of image and text features for adversarial examples and leverage the\nstrong generalization of pre-trained CLIP to guide the model-enhancing its\nrobust generalization on adversarial examples while maintaining its accuracy on\nclean ones. We also design a novel adaptive consistency objective function to\nbalance the consistency of adversarial inputs and clean inputs between the\nfine-tuning model and the pre-trained model. We conduct extensive experiments\nacross 14 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training\ndata settings) to show the superiority of CAPT over other state-of-the-art\nadaption methods. CAPT demonstrated excellent performance in terms of the\nin-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution\nshift and across datasets.",

    "abstract": "Polyp segmentation for colonoscopy images is of vital importance in clinical\npractice. It can provide valuable information for colorectal cancer diagnosis\nand surgery. While existing methods have achieved relatively good performance,\npolyp segmentation still faces the following challenges: (1) Varying lighting\nconditions in colonoscopy and differences in polyp locations, sizes, and\nmorphologies. (2) The indistinct boundary between polyps and surrounding\ntissue. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-scale information\nsharing and selection network (MISNet) for polyp segmentation task. We design a\nSelectively Shared Fusion Module (SSFM) to enforce information sharing and\nactive selection between low-level and high-level features, thereby enhancing\nmodel's ability to capture comprehensive information. We then design a Parallel\nAttention Module (PAM) to enhance model's attention to boundaries, and a\nBalancing Weight Module (BWM) to facilitate the continuous refinement of\nboundary segmentation in the bottom-up process. Experiments on five polyp\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that MISNet successfully improved the\naccuracy and clarity of segmentation result, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

Training models on such data foster biased learning and hallucinations\nas models tend to make similar unwarranted assumptions. To address this issue,\nwe collect contextual data for each sample whenever available and train a\ncontext selection module to facilitate evidence-based model predictions. Strong\nimprovements across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach.

CARA\nexhibits generalization to new benchmarks it wasn't trained on, underscoring\nits utility for future VLU benchmarks in detecting or cleaning samples with\ninadequate context. Finally, we curate a Context Ambiguity and Sufficiency\nEvaluation (CASE) set to benchmark the performance of insufficient context\ndetectors.

Although IL benefits from its\nability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large\ndatasets, the resulting planners often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical\nrule-based planners, by design, can generate safe traffic rule compliant\nbehaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these planners fail to\ncapture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human drivers' intent.\nRuleFuser, an evidential framework, combines IL planners with classical\nrule-based planners to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby\nstriking a balance between imitation and safety.\n  Our approach, tested on the real-world nuPlan dataset, combines the IL\nplanner's high performance in in-distribution (ID) scenarios with the\nrule-based planners' enhanced safety in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,\nachieving a 38.43% average improvement on safety metrics over the IL planner\nwithout much detriment to imitation metrics in OOD scenarios.",

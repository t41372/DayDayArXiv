    "abstract": "AI-powered medical scribes have emerged as a promising solution to alleviate\nthe documentation burden in healthcare. Ambient AI scribes provide real-time\ntranscription and automated data entry into Electronic Health Records (EHRs),\nwith the potential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance\nscalability. Despite early success, the accuracy of AI scribes remains\ncritical, as errors can lead to significant clinical consequences.\nAdditionally, AI scribes face challenges in handling the complexity and\nvariability of medical language and ensuring the privacy of sensitive patient\ndata. This case study aims to evaluate Sporo Health's AI scribe, a multi-agent\nsystem leveraging fine-tuned medical LLMs, by comparing its performance with\nOpenAI's GPT-4o Mini on multiple performance metrics. Using a dataset of\nde-identified patient conversation transcripts, AI-generated summaries were\ncompared to clinician-generated notes (the ground truth) based on clinical\ncontent recall, precision, and F1 scores. Evaluations were further supplemented\nby clinician satisfaction assessments using a modified Physician Documentation\nQuality Instrument revision 9 (PDQI-9), rated by both a medical student and a\nphysician. The results show that Sporo AI consistently outperformed GPT-4o\nMini, achieving higher recall, precision, and overall F1 scores. Moreover, the\nAI generated summaries provided by Sporo were rated more favorably in terms of\naccuracy, comprehensiveness, and relevance, with fewer hallucinations. These\nfindings demonstrate that Sporo AI Scribe is an effective and reliable tool for\nclinical documentation, enhancing clinician workflows while maintaining high\nstandards of privacy and security.",

However, current\nbenchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and\nmaking it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks\ntypically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize\nor guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence\nAssessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic\nquestion templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as\nmathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The\naccompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge\ntemplates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text,\nPDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity\nchallenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's\nreliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed\nthat even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in\nvarying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably,\nAPI models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities,\nwhile ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage.\nIn self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what\ntasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using\nDIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often\ndisplay unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions.

The robot queries a\nstable object library to facilitate assembly inference and guide learning. In\naddition to the robot policy, an action mask is developed to rule out invalid\nactions that violate physical constraints for object-oriented construction. We\ndemonstrate the proposed framework's feasibility and robustness in a variety of\nassembly scenarios in which the robot satisfies real-life assembly with respect\nto both solution and runtime quality. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the\nproposed framework effectively infers and assembles incomplete structures for\nunseen and unique object types.",

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is\ngrowing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions\nwithout conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative\ngraph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction\nyields. A key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention\nmechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers.\nThis design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial\nrole of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which\nultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global\nreaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures\ndetailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates\nintermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM\neffectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and\ninfluence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations.\nlog-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium\nto high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor.

Our research investigates the relationship between the\ntraining process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in\nexisting research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation\nstrategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and\nseveral hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends\nthroughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity\nDropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations\nby reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically\ndropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as\nSensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised\nhallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates\nthe traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated\ninto our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and\neffective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates\nthat our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared\nto normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual\naccuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.",

    "abstract": "The most common method to auto-grade a student's submission in a CS1 or a CS2\ncourse is to run it against a pre-defined test suite and compare the results\nagainst reference results. However, this technique cannot be used if the\ncorrectness of the solution goes beyond simple output, such as the algorithm\nused to obtain the result. There is no convenient method for the graders to\nidentify the kind of algorithm used in solving a problem. They must read the\nsource code and understand the algorithm implemented and its features, which\nmakes the process tedious. We propose CASET(Complexity Analysis using Simple\nExecution Traces), a novel tool to analyze the time complexity of algorithms\nusing dynamic traces and unsupervised machine learning. CASET makes it\nconvenient for tutors to classify the submissions for a program into time\ncomplexity baskets. Thus, tutors can identify the algorithms used by the\nsubmissions without necessarily going through the code written by the students.\nCASET's analysis can be used to improve grading and provide detailed feedback\nfor submissions that try to match the results without a proper algorithm, for\nexample, hard-coding a binary result, pattern-matching the visible or common\ninputs. We show the effectiveness of CASET by computing the time complexity of\nmany classes of algorithms like sorting, searching and those using dynamic\nprogramming paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Black box attacks, where adversaries have limited knowledge of the target\nmodel, pose a significant threat to machine learning systems. Adversarial\nexamples generated with a substitute model often suffer from limited\ntransferability to the target model. While recent work explores ranking\nperturbations for improved success rates, these methods see only modest gains.\nWe propose a novel strategy called PEAS that can boost the transferability of\nexisting black box attacks. PEAS leverages the insight that samples which are\nperceptually equivalent exhibit significant variability in their adversarial\ntransferability. Our approach first generates a set of images from an initial\nsample via subtle augmentations. We then evaluate the transferability of\nadversarial perturbations on these images using a set of substitute models.\nFinally, the most transferable adversarial example is selected and used for the\nattack. Our experiments show that PEAS can double the performance of existing\nattacks, achieving a 2.5x improvement in attack success rates on average over\ncurrent ranking methods. We thoroughly evaluate PEAS on ImageNet and CIFAR-10,\nanalyze hyperparameter impacts, and provide an ablation study to isolate each\ncomponent's importance.",

Recently, diffusion-based I2V models have\nachieved remarkable progress given their novel design on network architecture,\ncascaded framework, and motion representation. However, restricted by their\nnoise-to-data generation process, diffusion-based methods inevitably suffer the\ndifficulty to generate video samples with both appearance consistency and\ntemporal coherence from an uninformative Gaussian noise, which may limit their\nsynthesis quality. In this work, we present FrameBridge, taking the given\nstatic image as the prior of video target and establishing a tractable bridge\nmodel between them. By formulating I2V synthesis as a frames-to-frames\ngeneration task and modelling it with a data-to-data process, we fully exploit\nthe information in input image and facilitate the generative model to learn the\nimage animation process. In two popular settings of training I2V models, namely\nfine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) model or training from scratch,\nwe further propose two techniques, SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF) and neural\nprior, which improve the fine-tuning efficiency of diffusion-based T2V models\nto FrameBridge and the synthesis quality of bridge-based I2V models\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have driven a paradigm shift,\nwhere large language models (LLMs) with billions or trillions of parameters are\ntrained on vast datasets, achieving unprecedented success across a series of\nlanguage tasks. However, despite these successes, LLMs still rely on\nprobabilistic modeling, which often captures spurious correlations rooted in\nlinguistic patterns and social stereotypes, rather than the true causal\nrelationships between entities and events. This limitation renders LLMs\nvulnerable to issues such as demographic biases, social stereotypes, and LLM\nhallucinations. These challenges highlight the urgent need to integrate\ncausality into LLMs, moving beyond correlation-driven paradigms to build more\nreliable and ethically aligned AI systems.\n  While many existing surveys and studies focus on utilizing prompt engineering\nto activate LLMs for causal knowledge or developing benchmarks to assess their\ncausal reasoning abilities, most of these efforts rely on human intervention to\nactivate pre-trained models. How to embed causality into the training process\nof LLMs and build more general and intelligent models remains unexplored.\nRecent research highlights that LLMs function as causal parrots, capable of\nreciting causal knowledge without truly understanding or applying it. These\nprompt-based methods are still limited to human interventional improvements.\nThis survey aims to address this gap by exploring how causality can enhance\nLLMs at every stage of their lifecycle-from token embedding learning and\nfoundation model training to fine-tuning, alignment, inference, and\nevaluation-paving the way for more interpretable, reliable, and\ncausally-informed models. Additionally, we further outline six promising future\ndirections to advance LLM development, enhance their causal reasoning\ncapabilities, and address the current limitations these models face.",

In\ncontrast to non-spiking deep neural networks (DNNs), SNNs can encode and\ntransmit spatiotemporal information more efficiently by exploiting biologically\nrealistic and low-power event-driven neuromorphic architectures. However, the\nsupervised learning of SNNs still remains a challenge because the\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of connected spiking neurons is\ndifficult to implement and interpret in existing backpropagation learning\nschemes. This paper proposes a fractional-order spike-timing-dependent gradient\ndescent (FO-STDGD) learning model by considering a derived nonlinear activation\nfunction that describes the relationship between the quasi-instantaneous firing\nrate and the temporal membrane potentials of nonleaky integrate-and-fire\nneurons. The training strategy can be generalized to any fractional orders\nbetween 0 and 2 since the FO-STDGD incorporates the fractional gradient descent\nmethod into the calculation of spike-timing-dependent loss gradients. The\nproposed FO-STDGD model is tested on the MNIST and DVS128 Gesture datasets and\nits accuracy under different network structure and fractional orders is\nanalyzed. It can be found that the classification accuracy increases as the\nfractional order increases, and specifically, the case of fractional order 1.9\nimproves by 155% relative to the case of fractional order 1 (traditional\ngradient descent).

    "abstract": "Can peer recommendation engines elevate people's creative performances in\nself-organizing social networks? Answering this question requires resolving\nchallenges in data collection (e.g., tracing inspiration links and\npsycho-social attributes of nodes) and intervention design (e.g., balancing\nidea stimulation and redundancy in evolving information environments). We\ntrained a model that predicts people's ideation performances using semantic and\nnetwork-structural features in an online platform. Using this model, we built\nSocialMuse, which maximizes people's predicted performances to generate peer\nrecommendations for them. We found treatment networks leveraging SocialMuse\noutperforming AI-agnostic control networks in several creativity measures. The\ntreatment networks were more decentralized than the control, as SocialMuse\nincreasingly emphasized network-structural features at large network sizes.\nThis decentralization spreads people's inspiration sources, helping inspired\nideas stand out better. Our study provides actionable insights into building\nintelligent systems for elevating creativity.",

    "abstract": "In retrieval-augmented systems, context ranking techniques are commonly\nemployed to reorder the retrieved contexts based on their relevance to a user\nquery. A standard approach is to measure this relevance through the similarity\nbetween contexts and queries in the embedding space. However, such similarity\noften fails to capture the relevance. Alternatively, large language models\n(LLMs) have been used for ranking contexts. However, they can encounter\nscalability issues when the number of candidate contexts grows and the context\nwindow sizes of the LLMs remain constrained. Additionally, these approaches\nrequire fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific data. In this work, we introduce\na scalable ranking framework that combines embedding similarity and LLM\ncapabilities without requiring LLM fine-tuning. Our framework uses a\npre-trained LLM to hypothesize the user query based on the retrieved contexts\nand ranks the context based on the similarity between the hypothesized queries\nand the user query. Our framework is efficient at inference time and is\ncompatible with many other retrieval and ranking techniques. Experimental\nresults show that our method improves the ranking performance across multiple\nbenchmarks. The complete code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/zwc662/hyqe",

To speed up inference, maintaining a key-value (KV) cache\nmemory is essential. Nonetheless, the growing demands for KV cache memory\ncreate significant hurdles for efficient implementation. This work introduces a\nnovel architecture, Cross-Layer Latent Attention (CLLA), aimed at compressing\nthe KV cache to less than 2% of its original size while maintaining comparable\nperformance levels. CLLA integrates multiple aspects of KV cache compression,\nincluding attention head/dimension reduction, layer sharing, and quantization\ntechniques, into a cohesive framework. Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CLLA achieves lossless performance on most tasks while utilizing minimal\nKV cache, marking a significant advancement in practical KV cache compression.",

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach to\nenhance graph neural networks' (GNNs) ability to learn rich representations\nfrom unlabeled graph-structured data. However, current GCL models face\nchallenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often\nrelying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes.\nThis constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological\ncharacteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning\n(TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology\n(EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction.\nOur approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse\ninformation from graph and topological features obtained from multiple\naugmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and\ncontraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature\ntensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of\nlearned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH.\nExperiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets\ndemonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art\nmethods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while\nachieving comparable results on the remaining two.

It examines how large language models (LLMs)\ncan simulate human decision-making and the inductive biases present in AI\nresearch. The study introduces two AI models: C.A.L.L.O.N. (Conventionally\nAverage Late Liberal ONtology) and M.A.U.S.S. (More Accurate Understanding of\nSociety and its Symbols). The former is trained on standard data, while the\nlatter is adapted with anthropological knowledge. The research highlights how\nanthropological training can enhance LLMs' ability to recognize diverse\neconomic systems and concepts. The findings suggest that integrating economic\nanthropology with AI can provide a more pluralistic understanding of economics\nand improve the sustainability of non-market economic systems.",

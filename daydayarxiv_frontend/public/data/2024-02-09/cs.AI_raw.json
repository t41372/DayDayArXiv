    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and\nbasic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on\nthe formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence\nof incorporating \"positive thinking\" into the system message of the prompt,\nthen compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance\nof 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of\nThought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70\nbillion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not\nuniversally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of\n\"positive thinking\" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably,\nhowever, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought,\nas the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the\ncombinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with\nhand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the\nperformance of the best \"positive thinking\" prompt against the output of\nsystematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt\noptimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even\nwhen working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal\nthat the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of\npeculiarity far beyond expectations.",

    "abstract": "Data annotation remains the sine qua non of machine learning and AI. Recent\nempirical work on data annotation has begun to highlight the importance of\nrater diversity for fairness, model performance, and new lines of research have\nbegun to examine the working conditions for data annotation workers, the\nimpacts and role of annotator subjectivity on labels, and the potential\npsychological harms from aspects of annotation work. This paper outlines a\ncritical genealogy of data annotation; starting with its psychological and\nperceptual aspects. We draw on similarities with critiques of the rise of\ncomputerized lab-based psychological experiments in the 1970's which question\nwhether these experiments permit the generalization of results beyond the\nlaboratory settings within which these results are typically obtained. Do data\nannotations permit the generalization of results beyond the settings, or\nlocations, in which they were obtained? Psychology is overly reliant on\nparticipants from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic\nsocieties (WEIRD). Many of the people who work as data annotation platform\nworkers, however, are not from WEIRD countries; most data annotation workers\nare based in Global South countries. Social categorizations and classifications\nfrom WEIRD countries are imposed on non-WEIRD annotators through instructions\nand tasks, and through them, on data, which is then used to train or evaluate\nAI models in WEIRD countries. We synthesize evidence from several recent lines\nof research and argue that data annotation is a form of automated social\ncategorization that risks entrenching outdated and static social categories\nthat are in reality dynamic and changing. We propose a framework for\nunderstanding the interplay of the global social conditions of data annotation\nwith the subjective phenomenological experience of data annotation work.",

A notable example of such data scarcity is found in the\ndomain of marine biology, where it is useful to develop methods to\nautomatically detect submarine species for environmental monitoring. To address\nthis data limitation, the state-of-the-art machine learning strategies employ\ntwo main approaches. The first involves pretraining models on existing datasets\nbefore generalizing to the specific domain of interest. The second strategy is\nto create synthetic datasets specifically tailored to the target domain using\nmethods like copy-paste techniques or ad-hoc simulators. The first strategy\noften faces a significant domain shift, while the second demands custom\nsolutions crafted for the specific task. In response to these challenges, here\nwe propose a transfer learning framework that is valid for a generic scenario.\nIn this framework, generated images help to improve the performances of an\nobject detector in a few-real data regime. This is achieved through a\ndiffusion-based generative model that was pretrained on large generic datasets.\nWith respect to the state-of-the-art, we find that it is not necessary to fine\ntune the generative model on the specific domain of interest. We believe that\nthis is an important advance because it mitigates the labor-intensive task of\nmanual labeling the images in object detection tasks. We validate our approach\nfocusing on fishes in an underwater environment, and on the more common domain\nof cars in an urban setting. Our method achieves detection performance\ncomparable to models trained on thousands of images, using only a few hundreds\nof input data.

We aim to design algorithms that identify a near-optimal\npolicy from the corrupted data, with provable guarantees. Existing theoretical\nworks have separately studied the settings of corruption robust RL (learning\nfrom scalar rewards directly under corruption) and offline RLHF (learning from\nhuman feedback without corruption); however, they are inapplicable to our\nproblem of dealing with corrupted data in offline RLHF setting.

For example, consider an LLM\nagent deployed to increase Twitter engagement; the LLM may retrieve its\nprevious tweets into the context window and make them more controversial,\nincreasing engagement but also toxicity. We identify and study two processes\nthat lead to ICRH: output-refinement and policy-refinement. For these\nprocesses, evaluations on static datasets are insufficient -- they miss the\nfeedback effects and thus cannot capture the most harmful behavior. In\nresponse, we provide three recommendations for evaluation to capture more\ninstances of ICRH. As AI development accelerates, the effects of feedback loops\nwill proliferate, increasing the need to understand their role in shaping LLM\nbehavior.",

    "abstract": "Datasets are foundational to many breakthroughs in modern artificial\nintelligence. Many recent achievements in the space of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) can be attributed to the finetuning of pre-trained models on a\ndiverse set of tasks that enables a large language model (LLM) to respond to\ninstructions. Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) requires specifically constructed\nand annotated datasets. However, existing datasets are almost all in the\nEnglish language. In this work, our primary goal is to bridge the language gap\nby building a human-curated instruction-following dataset spanning 65\nlanguages. We worked with fluent speakers of languages from around the world to\ncollect natural instances of instructions and completions. Furthermore, we\ncreate the most extensive multilingual collection to date, comprising 513\nmillion instances through templating and translating existing datasets across\n114 languages. In total, we contribute four key resources: we develop and\nopen-source the Aya Annotation Platform, the Aya Dataset, the Aya Collection,\nand the Aya Evaluation Suite. The Aya initiative also serves as a valuable case\nstudy in participatory research, involving collaborators from 119 countries. We\nsee this as a valuable framework for future research collaborations that aim to\nbridge gaps in resources.",

There has been little progress\nin designing artificial partners exhibiting a similar social experience as\nplaying with another person. Neural network architectures that implement\ngenerative models, such as large language models, are suited for producing\nmusical scores. Playing music socially, however, involves more than playing a\nscore; it must complement the other musicians' ideas and keep time correctly.\nWe addressed the question of whether a convincing social experience is made\npossible by a generative model trained to produce musical scores, not\nnecessarily optimized for synchronization and continuation. The network, a\nvariational autoencoder trained on a large corpus of digital scores, was\nadapted for a timed call-and-response task with a human partner. Participants\nplayed piano with a human or artificial partner-in various configurations-and\nrated the performance quality and first-person experience of self-other\nintegration. Overall, the artificial partners held promise but were rated lower\nthan human partners. The artificial partner with simplest design and highest\nsimilarity parameter was not rated differently from the human partners on some\nmeasures, suggesting that interactive rather than generative sophistication is\nimportant in enabling social AI.",

On one hand, LLMs excel at natural language processing but do\nnot perform well on planning. On the other hand, classical planning tools excel\nat planning tasks but require input in a structured language such as the\nPlanning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We leverage the strengths of both\nthe techniques by using an LLM for generating the PDDL representation (task\nPDDL) of planning task requests followed by using a classical planner for\ncomputing a plan. Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task\nPDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for\ngenerating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural\nlanguage task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent\ninformation from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner\n(currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the\ntarget task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using\nan LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM\nerrors.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent agents to execute\nintricate tasks within domain-specific software such as browsers and games.\nHowever, when applied to general-purpose software systems like operating\nsystems, LLM agents face three primary challenges. Firstly, the action space is\nvast and dynamic, posing difficulties for LLM agents to maintain an up-to-date\nunderstanding and deliver accurate responses. Secondly, real-world tasks often\nrequire inter-application cooperation}, demanding farsighted planning from LLM\nagents. Thirdly, agents need to identify optimal solutions aligning with user\nconstraints, such as security concerns and preferences. These challenges\nmotivate AndroidArena, an environment and benchmark designed to evaluate LLM\nagents on a modern operating system. To address high-cost of manpower, we\ndesign a scalable and semi-automated method to construct the benchmark. In the\ntask evaluation, AndroidArena incorporates accurate and adaptive metrics to\naddress the issue of non-unique solutions. Our findings reveal that even\nstate-of-the-art LLM agents struggle in cross-APP scenarios and adhering to\nspecific constraints. Additionally, we identify a lack of four key\ncapabilities, i.e., understanding, reasoning, exploration, and reflection, as\nprimary reasons for the failure of LLM agents. Furthermore, we provide\nempirical analysis on the failure of reflection, and improve the success rate\nby 27% with our proposed exploration strategy. This work is the first to\npresent valuable insights in understanding fine-grained weakness of LLM agents,\nand offers a path forward for future research in this area.

Reward-gradient guided denoising\nhas been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a\ndifferentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution\ncaptured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a\ndifferentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples,\nlimiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper, we\npropose DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization with\ntrajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while\nstaying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during\nevolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box\nreward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated\ndiffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps,\nallowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show\nthat DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan, an\nestablished closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES\noutperforms existing sampling-based planners, reactive deterministic or\ndiffusion-based policies, and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally, we show\nthat unlike prior guidance methods, our method can optimize non-differentiable\nlanguage-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When\nguided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow, our method can\ngenerate novel, highly complex behaviors, such as aggressive lane weaving,\nwhich are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest\nnuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory\noptimization methods and driving policies.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), which\nprovides a unified view of logical and probabilistic reasoning. The QBBN is\nmeant to address a central problem with the Large Language Model (LLM), which\nhas become extremely popular in Information Retrieval, which is that the LLM\nhallucinates. A Bayesian Network, by construction, cannot hallucinate, because\nit can only return answers that it can explain. We show how a Bayesian Network\nover an unbounded number of boolean variables can be configured to represent\nthe logical reasoning underlying human language. We do this by creating a\nkey-value version of the First-Order Calculus, for which we can prove\nconsistency and completeness. We show that the model is trivially trained over\nfully observed data, but that inference is non-trivial. Exact inference in a\nBayesian Network is intractable (i.e. $\\Omega(2^N)$ for $N$ variables). For\ninference, we investigate the use of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), which is\nnot guaranteed to converge, but which has been shown to often converge in\npractice. Our experiments show that LBP indeed does converge very reliably, and\nour analysis shows that a round of LBP takes time $O(N2^n)$, where $N$ bounds\nthe number of variables considered, and $n$ bounds the number of incoming\nconnections to any factor, and further improvements may be possible. Our\nnetwork is specifically designed to alternate between AND and OR gates in a\nBoolean Algebra, which connects more closely to logical reasoning, allowing a\ncompleteness proof for an expanded version of our network, and also allows\ninference to follow specific but adequate pathways, that turn out to be fast.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Graphs widely exist in the real world, which carry complicated\nspatial and temporal feature patterns, challenging their representation\nlearning. Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have shown impressive\npredictive abilities by exploiting the intrinsic dynamics. However, DGNNs\nexhibit limited robustness, prone to adversarial attacks. This paper presents\nthe novel Dynamic Graph Information Bottleneck (DGIB) framework to learn robust\nand discriminative representations. Leveraged by the Information Bottleneck\n(IB) principle, we first propose the expected optimal representations should\nsatisfy the Minimal-Sufficient-Consensual (MSC) Condition. To compress\nredundant as well as conserve meritorious information into latent\nrepresentation, DGIB iteratively directs and refines the structural and feature\ninformation flow passing through graph snapshots. To meet the MSC Condition, we\ndecompose the overall IB objectives into DGIB$_{MS}$ and DGIB$_C$, in which the\nDGIB$_{MS}$ channel aims to learn the minimal and sufficient representations,\nwith the DGIB$_{MS}$ channel guarantees the predictive consensus. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world and synthetic dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior robustness of DGIB against adversarial attacks compared with\nstate-of-the-art baselines in the link prediction task. To the best of our\nknowledge, DGIB is the first work to learn robust representations of dynamic\ngraphs grounded in the information-theoretic IB principle.",

    "abstract": "To enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability, calibration is\nessential -- the model's assessed confidence scores should align with the\nactual likelihood of its responses being correct. However, current confidence\nelicitation methods and calibration metrics typically rely on a binary\ntrue/false assessment of response correctness. This approach does not apply to\nlong-form generation, where an answer can be partially correct. Addressing this\ngap, we introduce a unified calibration framework, in which both the\ncorrectness of the LLMs' responses and their associated confidence levels are\ntreated as distributions across a range of scores. Within this framework, we\ndevelop three metrics to precisely evaluate LLM calibration and further propose\ntwo confidence elicitation methods based on self-consistency and\nself-evaluation. Our experiments, which include long-form QA and summarization\ntasks, demonstrate that larger models don't necessarily guarantee better\ncalibration, that calibration performance is found to be metric-dependent, and\nthat self-consistency methods excel in factoid datasets. We also find that\ncalibration can be enhanced through techniques such as fine-tuning, integrating\nrelevant source documents, scaling the temperature, and combining\nself-consistency with self-evaluation. Lastly, we showcase a practical\napplication of our system: selecting and cascading open-source models and\nChatGPT to optimize correctness given a limited API budget. This research not\nonly challenges existing notions of LLM calibration but also offers practical\nmethodologies for improving trustworthiness in long-form generation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how failure occurs and how it can be prevented in reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is necessary to enable debugging, maintain user trust, and\ndevelop personalized policies. Counterfactual reasoning has often been used to\nassign blame and understand failure by searching for the closest possible world\nin which the failure is avoided. However, current counterfactual state\nexplanations in RL can only explain an outcome using just the current state\nfeatures and offer no actionable recourse on how a negative outcome could have\nbeen prevented. In this work, we propose ACTER (Actionable Counterfactual\nSequences for Explaining Reinforcement Learning Outcomes), an algorithm for\ngenerating counterfactual sequences that provides actionable advice on how\nfailure can be avoided. ACTER investigates actions leading to a failure and\nuses the evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II to generate counterfactual sequences of\nactions that prevent it with minimal changes and high certainty even in\nstochastic environments. Additionally, ACTER generates a set of multiple\ndiverse counterfactual sequences that enable users to correct failure in the\nway that best fits their preferences. We also introduce three diversity metrics\nthat can be used for evaluating the diversity of counterfactual sequences. We\nevaluate ACTER in two RL environments, with both discrete and continuous\nactions, and show that it can generate actionable and diverse counterfactual\nsequences. We conduct a user study to explore how explanations generated by\nACTER help users identify and correct failure.",

Yet, the integration of\ngenerative AI as expressive materials in therapeutic storymaking remains\nunderexplored. And there is a lack of HCI implications on how to support\nfamilies and therapists in this context. Addressing this, our study involved\nfive weeks of storymaking sessions with seven families guided by a professional\ntherapist. In these sessions, the families used both traditional art-making\nmaterials and image-based generative AI to create and evolve their family\nstories. Via the rich empirical data and commentaries from four expert\ntherapists, we contextualize how families creatively melded AI and traditional\nexpressive materials to externalize their ideas and feelings. Through the lens\nof Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC), we characterize the therapeutic\nimplications of AI as expressive materials. Desirable interaction qualities to\nsupport children, parents, and therapists are distilled for future HCI\nresearch.",

Research has found that designing lightweight\ncollaborative search plugins within instant messaging platforms aligns better\nwith users' collaborative habits.

Equipped with the capacity to understand the queries and context in\nmulti-user conversations and the ability to search the Web for relevant\ninformation via APIs, CoSearchAgent can respond to user queries with answers\ngrounded on the relevant search results.

To facilitate representation learning on TIGs, researchers\nhave proposed a series of TIG models. However, these models are still facing\ntwo tough gaps between the pre-training and downstream predictions in their\n``pre-train, predict'' training paradigm. First, the temporal discrepancy\nbetween the pre-training and inference data severely undermines the models'\napplicability in distant future predictions on the dynamically evolving data.\nSecond, the semantic divergence between pretext and downstream tasks hinders\ntheir practical applications, as they struggle to align with their learning and\nprediction capabilities across application scenarios.\n  Recently, the ``pre-train, prompt'' paradigm has emerged as a lightweight\nmechanism for model generalization. Applying this paradigm is a potential\nsolution to solve the aforementioned challenges. However, the adaptation of\nthis paradigm to TIGs is not straightforward. The application of prompting in\nstatic graph contexts falls short in temporal settings due to a lack of\nconsideration for time-sensitive dynamics and a deficiency in expressive power.\nTo address this issue, we introduce Temporal Interaction Graph Prompting\n(TIGPrompt), a versatile framework that seamlessly integrates with TIG models,\nbridging both the temporal and semantic gaps. In detail, we propose a temporal\nprompt generator to offer temporally-aware prompts for different tasks. These\nprompts stand out for their minimalistic design, relying solely on the tuning\nof the prompt generator with very little supervision data. To cater to varying\ncomputational resource demands, we propose an extended ``pre-train,\nprompt-based fine-tune'' paradigm, offering greater flexibility.

    "abstract": "Traditional discriminative approaches in mental health analysis are known for\ntheir strong capacity but lack interpretability and demand large-scale\nannotated data. The generative approaches, such as those based on large\nlanguage models (LLMs), have the potential to get rid of heavy annotations and\nprovide explanations but their capabilities still fall short compared to\ndiscriminative approaches, and their explanations may be unreliable due to the\nfact that the generation of explanation is a black-box process. Inspired by the\npsychological assessment practice of using scales to evaluate mental states,\nour method which is called Mental Analysis by Incorporating Mental Scales\n(MAIMS), incorporates two procedures via LLMs. First, the patient completes\nmental scales, and second, the psychologist interprets the collected\ninformation from the mental scales and makes informed decisions. Experimental\nresults show that MAIMS outperforms other zero-shot methods. MAIMS can generate\nmore rigorous explanation based on the outputs of mental scales",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as intelligent agents in\ninteractive decision-making tasks. Traditional approaches often depend on\nmeticulously designed prompts, high-quality examples, or additional reward\nmodels for in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, or RLHF. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) presents a dynamic alternative for LLMs to overcome these\ndependencies by engaging directly with task-specific environments. Nonetheless,\nit faces significant hurdles: 1) instability stemming from the exponentially\nvast action space requiring exploration; 2) challenges in assigning token-level\ncredit based on action-level reward signals, resulting in discord between\nmaximizing rewards and accurately modeling corpus data. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce Entropy-Regularized Token-level Policy Optimization\n(ETPO), an entropy-augmented RL method tailored for optimizing LLMs at the\ntoken level. At the heart of ETPO is our novel per-token soft Bellman update,\ndesigned to harmonize the RL process with the principles of language modeling.\nThis methodology decomposes the Q-function update from a coarse action-level\nview to a more granular token-level perspective, backed by theoretical proof of\noptimization consistency. Crucially, this decomposition renders linear time\ncomplexity in action exploration. We assess the effectiveness of ETPO within a\nsimulated environment that models data science code generation as a series of\nmulti-step interactive tasks; results underline ETPO's potential as a robust\nmethod for refining the interactive decision-making capabilities of language\nagents.

However, measurement of spinopelvic\nradiographic parameters is time-intensive and interobserver reliability is a\nconcern. Automated measurement tools have the promise of rapid and consistent\nmeasurements, but existing tools are still limited by some degree of manual\nuser-entry requirements. This study presents a novel artificial intelligence\n(AI) tool called SpinePose that automatically predicts spinopelvic parameters\nwith high accuracy without the need for manual entry.\n  Methods. SpinePose was trained and validated on 761 sagittal whole-spine\nX-rays to predict sagittal vertical axis (SVA), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic\nincidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), lumbar lordosis (LL), T1-pelvic angle\n(T1PA), and L1-pelvic angle (L1PA). A separate test set of 40 X-rays was\nlabeled by 4 reviewers, including fellowship-trained spine surgeons and a\nfellowship-trained radiologist with neuroradiology subspecialty certification.\nMedian errors relative to the most senior reviewer were calculated to determine\nmodel accuracy on test images. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were\nused to assess inter-rater reliability.\n  Results. SpinePose exhibited the following median (interquartile range)\nparameter errors: SVA: 2.2(2.3)mm, p=0.93; PT: 1.3(1.2){\\deg}, p=0.48; SS:\n1.7(2.2){\\deg}, p=0.64; PI: 2.2(2.1){\\deg}, p=0.24; LL: 2.6(4.0){\\deg}, p=0.89;\nT1PA: 1.1(0.9){\\deg}, p=0.42; and L1PA: 1.4(1.6){\\deg}, p=0.49.

Our human study shows that the\ngenerated samples are semantically equivalent to the original samples,\nproviding an effective solution for LLMs augmentation.

    "abstract": "For the Facial Action Unit (AU) detection task, accurately capturing the\nsubtle facial differences between distinct AUs is essential for reliable\ndetection. Additionally, AU detection faces challenges from class imbalance and\nthe presence of noisy or false labels, which undermine detection accuracy. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel contrastive learning framework aimed for AU\ndetection that incorporates both self-supervised and supervised signals,\nthereby enhancing the learning of discriminative features for accurate AU\ndetection. To tackle the class imbalance issue, we employ a negative sample\nre-weighting strategy that adjusts the step size of updating parameters for\nminority and majority class samples. Moreover, to address the challenges posed\nby noisy and false AU labels, we employ a sampling technique that encompasses\nthree distinct types of positive sample pairs. This enables us to inject\nself-supervised signals into the supervised signal, effectively mitigating the\nadverse effects of noisy labels. Our experimental assessments, conducted on\nfive widely-utilized benchmark datasets (BP4D, DISFA, BP4D+, GFT and\nAff-Wild2), underscore the superior performance of our approach compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods of AU detection.",

With the rise of\nsponsored products and their increasing prominence in online marketplaces,\nretailers face new challenges in effectively managing their product assortment\nin the presence of sponsored products. Remarkably, previous research in\nassortment planning largely overlooks the existence of sponsored products and\ntheir potential impact on overall recommendation effectiveness. Instead, they\ncommonly make the simplifying assumption that all products are either organic\nor non-sponsored. This research gap underscores the necessity for a more\nthorough investigation of the assortment planning challenge when sponsored\nproducts are in play.

These limitations are particularly pronounced in assistive\ntechnologies designed for individuals with diverse cognitive states and motor\nintentions. In this paper, we introduce a framework that leverages\nReinforcement Learning (RL) with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for classification\ntasks.

We elaborate\non the data processing methods for two EEG motor imagery datasets.

This mechanism allows the\nsystem to learn optimal actions through trial and error, progressively\nimproving its performance. RLEEGNet demonstrates high accuracy in classifying\nMI-EEG signals, achieving as high as 100% accuracy in MI tasks across both the\nGigaScience (3-class) and BCI-IV-2a (4-class) datasets.

However, (i) Most\nscalable GNNs tend to treat all nodes in graphs with the same propagation\nrules, neglecting their topological uniqueness; (ii) Existing node-wise\npropagation optimization strategies are insufficient on web-scale graphs with\nintricate topology, where a full portrayal of nodes' local properties is\nrequired. Intuitively, different nodes in web-scale graphs possess distinct\ntopological roles, and therefore propagating them indiscriminately or neglect\nlocal contexts may compromise the quality of node representations. This\nintricate topology in web-scale graphs cannot be matched by small-scale\nscenarios.

Therefore, this approach can be\nseamlessly integrated into most scalable GNNs while remain orthogonal to\nexisting node-wise propagation optimization strategies.

The\nemergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce\nthis cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However,\nexisting methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation\nsparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further\namplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can\nlearn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity.

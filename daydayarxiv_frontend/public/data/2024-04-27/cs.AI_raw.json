    "abstract": "The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical\nresearch, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information.\nHowever, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep\nunderstanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under\ninvestigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various\ntasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve\nbiological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent\naugmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the\ndesign process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages\nthe reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR\nsystems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting\nprotocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We\nshowcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with\ngene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agent's effectiveness in\na real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory\nconsiderations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the\nneed for responsible and transparent use of these tools.

    "abstract": "Logs are important in modern software development with runtime information.\nLog parsing is the first step in many log-based analyses, that involve\nextracting structured information from unstructured log data. Traditional log\nparsers face challenges in accurately parsing logs due to the diversity of log\nformats, which directly impacts the performance of downstream log-analysis\ntasks. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for log parsing and propose LLMParser, an LLM-based log parser based on\ngenerative LLMs and few-shot tuning. We leverage four LLMs, Flan-T5-small,\nFlan-T5-base, LLaMA-7B, and ChatGLM-6B in LLMParsers. Our evaluation of 16\nopen-source systems shows that LLMParser achieves statistically significantly\nhigher parsing accuracy than state-of-the-art parsers (a 96% average parsing\naccuracy). We further conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis on the effect\nof training size, model size, and pre-training LLM on log parsing accuracy. We\nfind that smaller LLMs may be more effective than more complex LLMs; for\ninstance where Flan-T5-base achieves comparable results as LLaMA-7B with a\nshorter inference time. We also find that using LLMs pre-trained using logs\nfrom other systems does not always improve parsing accuracy. While using\npre-trained Flan-T5-base shows an improvement in accuracy, pre-trained LLaMA\nresults in a decrease (decrease by almost 55% in group accuracy). In short, our\nstudy provides empirical evidence for using LLMs for log parsing and highlights\nthe limitations and future research direction of LLM-based log parsers.",

    "abstract": "Understanding relations arising out of interactions among entities can be\nvery difficult, and predicting them is even more challenging. This problem has\nmany applications in various fields, such as financial networks and e-commerce.\nThese relations can involve much more complexities than just involving more\nthan two entities. One such scenario is evolving recursive relations between\nmultiple entities, and so far, this is still an open problem. This work\naddresses the problem of forecasting higher-order interaction events that can\nbe multi-relational and recursive. We pose the problem in the framework of\nrepresentation learning of temporal hypergraphs that can capture complex\nrelationships involving multiple entities. The proposed model,\n\\textit{Relational Recursive Hyperedge Temporal Point Process} (RRHyperTPP)\nuses an encoder that learns a dynamic node representation based on the\nhistorical interaction patterns and then a hyperedge link prediction-based\ndecoder to model the occurrence of interaction events. These learned\nrepresentations are then used for downstream tasks involving forecasting the\ntype and time of interactions. The main challenge in learning from hyperedge\nevents is that the number of possible hyperedges grows exponentially with the\nnumber of nodes in the network. This will make the computation of negative\nlog-likelihood of the temporal point process expensive, as the calculation of\nsurvival function requires a summation over all possible hyperedges. In our\nwork, we develop a noise contrastive estimation method to learn the parameters\nof our model, and we have experimentally shown that our models perform better\nthan previous state-of-the-art methods for interaction forecasting.",

We validate our methodology in the context of\nautonomous vehicles navigating across cells defined based on location and\nweather conditions. To facilitate future benchmarking, we release a new\nmulti-stream large-scale synthetic semantic segmentation dataset, called DADE,\nand show that our multi-stream approach outperforms a single-stream baseline.\nWe believe that our work will open research opportunities in the IoT and 5G\neras, offering solutions for real-time model adaptation.",

Then, the text encoder of\nCLIP is utilized for embedding processed attribute descriptions. The averaged\nvisual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion\nTransformer for multi-modal interactive learning.

For example, we find a fleet average asymptotic\nimprovement of 8.5 percent in fuel economy compared to the baseline while also\nimproving on the metrics of acceleration error and shifting frequency for\nfleets serving a distribution of suburban routes.

    "abstract": "Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness\nin solving a wide range of tasks by integrating LLMs with key modules such as\nplanning, memory, and tool usage. Increasingly, customers are adopting LLM\nagents across a variety of commercial applications critical to reliability,\nincluding support for mental well-being, chemical synthesis, and software\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, our observations and daily use of LLM agents\nindicate that they are prone to making erroneous plans, especially when the\ntasks are complex and require long-term planning.\n  In this paper, we propose PDoctor, a novel and automated approach to testing\nLLM agents and understanding their erroneous planning. As the first work in\nthis direction, we formulate the detection of erroneous planning as a\nconstraint satisfiability problem: an LLM agent's plan is considered erroneous\nif its execution violates the constraints derived from the user inputs. To this\nend, PDoctor first defines a domain-specific language (DSL) for user queries\nand synthesizes varying inputs with the assistance of the Z3 constraint solver.\nThese synthesized inputs are natural language paragraphs that specify the\nrequirements for completing a series of tasks. Then, PDoctor derives\nconstraints from these requirements to form a testing oracle. We evaluate\nPDoctor with three mainstream agent frameworks and two powerful LLMs (GPT-3.5\nand GPT-4). The results show that PDoctor can effectively detect diverse errors\nin agent planning and provide insights and error characteristics that are\nvaluable to both agent developers and users. We conclude by discussing\npotential alternative designs and directions to extend PDoctor.",

    "abstract": "Driving in an off-road environment is challenging for autonomous vehicles due\nto the complex and varied terrain. To ensure stable and efficient travel, the\nvehicle requires consideration and balancing of environmental factors, such as\nundulations, roughness, and obstacles, to generate optimal trajectories that\ncan adapt to changing scenarios. However, traditional motion planners often\nutilize a fixed cost function for trajectory optimization, making it difficult\nto adapt to different driving strategies in challenging irregular terrains and\nuncommon scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive motion\nplanner based on human-like cognition and cost evaluation for off-road driving.\nFirst, we construct a multi-layer map describing different features of off-road\nterrains, including terrain elevation, roughness, obstacle, and artificial\npotential field map. Subsequently, we employ a CNN-LSTM network to learn the\ntrajectories planned by human drivers in various off-road scenarios. Then,\nbased on human-like generated trajectories in different environments, we design\na primitive-based trajectory planner that aims to mimic human trajectories and\ncost weight selection, generating trajectories that are consistent with the\ndynamics of off-road vehicles. Finally, we compute optimal cost weights and\nselect and extend behavioral primitives to generate highly adaptive, stable,\nand efficient trajectories.\n  We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments in a\ndesert off-road environment with complex terrain and varying road conditions.\nThe experimental results show that the proposed human-like motion planner has\nexcellent adaptability to different off-road conditions. It shows real-time\noperation, greater stability, and more human-like planning ability in diverse\nand challenging scenarios.",

The two problems may be addressed well by hybrid analog-digital\n(HAD) structure. But there exists the problem of phase ambiguity for HAD, which\nleads to its low-efficiency or high-latency. Does exist there such a MIMO\nstructure of owning low-cost, low-complexity and high time efficiency at the\nsame time. To satisfy the three properties, a novel heterogeneous hybrid MIMO\nreceiver structure of integrating FD and heterogeneous HAD ($\\rm{H}^2$AD-FD) is\nproposed and corresponding multi-modal (MD)-learning framework is developed.\nThe framework includes three major stages: 1) generate the candidate sets via\nroot multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC) or deep learning (DL); 2)\ninfer the class of true solutions from candidate sets using machine learning\n(ML) methods; 3) fuse the two-part true solutions to achieve a better DOA\nestimation. The above process form two methods named MD-Root-MUSIC and MDDL. To\nimprove DOA estimation accuracy and reduce the clustering complexity, a\nco-learning-aided MD framework is proposed to form two enhanced methods named\nCoMDDL and CoMD-RootMUSIC. Moreover, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the\nproposed $\\rm{H}^2$AD-FD structure is also derived. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed four methods could approach the CRLB for\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) > 0 dB and the proposed CoMDDL and MDDL perform\nbetter than CoMD-RootMUSIC and MD-RootMUSIC, particularly in the extremely low\nSNR region.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nimpressive in-context learning (ICL) abilities in various tasks, they still\nsuffer from poor performances compared to most supervised fine-tuned RE\nmethods. Utilizing ICL for RE with LLMs encounters two challenges: (1)\nretrieving good demonstrations from training examples, and (2) enabling LLMs\nexhibit strong ICL abilities in RE. On the one hand, retrieving good\ndemonstrations is a non-trivial process in RE, which easily results in low\nrelevance regarding entities and relations. On the other hand, ICL with an LLM\nachieves poor performance in RE while RE is different from language modeling in\nnature or the LLM is not large enough. In this work, we propose a novel\nrecall-retrieve-reason RE framework that synergizes LLMs with retrieval corpora\n(training examples) to enable relevant retrieving and reliable in-context\nreasoning. Specifically, we distill the consistently ontological knowledge from\ntraining datasets to let LLMs generate relevant entity pairs grounded by\nretrieval corpora as valid queries. These entity pairs are then used to\nretrieve relevant training examples from the retrieval corpora as\ndemonstrations for LLMs to conduct better ICL via instruction tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on different LLMs and RE datasets demonstrate that our method\ngenerates relevant and valid entity pairs and boosts ICL abilities of LLMs,\nachieving competitive or new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-level RE\ncompared to previous supervised fine-tuning methods and ICL-based methods.",

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave revealed remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capability for general zero\nand few-shot learning, recent studies indicate that current LLMs still struggle\nwith zero and few-shot RE. Previous studies are mainly dedicated to design\nprompt formats and select good examples for improving ICL-based RE. Although\nboth factors are vital for ICL, if one can fundamentally boost the ICL\ncapability of LLMs in RE, the zero and few-shot RE performance via ICL would be\nsignificantly improved. To this end, we introduce \\textsc{Micre} (\\textbf{M}eta\n\\textbf{I}n-\\textbf{C}ontext learning of LLMs for \\textbf{R}elation\n\\textbf{E}xtraction), a new meta-training framework for zero and few-shot RE\nwhere an LLM is tuned to do ICL on a diverse collection of RE datasets (i.e.,\nlearning to learn in context for RE). Through meta-training, the model becomes\nmore effectively to learn a new RE task in context by conditioning on a few\ntraining examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates at\ninference time, enabling better zero and few-shot task generalization. We\nexperiment \\textsc{Micre} on various LLMs with different model scales and 12\npublic RE datasets, and then evaluate it on unseen RE benchmarks under zero and\nfew-shot settings. \\textsc{Micre} delivers comparable or superior performance\ncompared to a range of baselines including supervised fine-tuning and typical\nin-context learning methods. We find that the gains are particular significant\nfor larger model scales, and using a diverse set of the meta-training RE\ndatasets is key to improvements. Empirically, we show that \\textsc{Micre} can\ntransfer the relation semantic knowledge via relation label name during\ninference on target RE datasets.",

Representation learning divides deep learning\nmodels into 'base' and 'head' components. The base component, capturing common\nfeatures across all clients, is shared with the server, while the head\ncomponent, capturing unique features specific to individual clients, remains\nlocal. We propose a new representation learning-based approach that suggests\ndecoupling the entire deep learning model into more densely divided parts with\nthe application of suitable scheduling methods, which can benefit not only data\nheterogeneity but also class heterogeneity.

To address the\nprevalent challenge of partial observability, communication-based algorithms\nhave improved cooperative performance through the sharing of numerical\nembedding between agents. However, the understanding of the formation of\ncollaborative mechanisms is still very limited, making designing a\nhuman-understandable communication mechanism a valuable problem to address. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm\nthat embeds large language models into agents, endowing them with the ability\nto generate human-understandable verbal communication. The entire framework has\na message module and an action module. The message module is responsible for\ngenerating and sending verbal messages to other agents, effectively enhancing\ninformation sharing among agents. To further enhance the message module, we\nemploy a teacher model to generate message labels from the global view and\nupdate the student model through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The action\nmodule receives messages from other agents and selects actions based on current\nlocal observations and received messages. Experiments conducted on the\nOvercooked game demonstrate our method significantly enhances the learning\nefficiency and performance of existing methods, while also providing an\ninterpretable tool for humans to understand the process of multi-agent\ncooperation.",

This paper introduces MRScore, an automatic evaluation\nmetric tailored for radiology report generation by leveraging Large Language\nModels (LLMs). Conventional NLG (natural language generation) metrics like BLEU\nare inadequate for accurately assessing the generated radiology reports, as\nsystematically demonstrated by our observations within this paper. To address\nthis challenge, we collaborated with radiologists to develop a framework that\nguides LLMs for radiology report evaluation, ensuring alignment with human\nanalysis. Our framework includes two key components: i) utilizing GPT to\ngenerate large amounts of training data, i.e., reports with different\nqualities, and ii) pairing GPT-generated reports as accepted and rejected\nsamples and training LLMs to produce MRScore as the model reward. Our\nexperiments demonstrate MRScore's higher correlation with human judgments and\nsuperior performance in model selection compared to traditional metrics.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have shown their\ncapabilities in supporting medical decision-making. Embedding LLMs in medical\nsystems is becoming a promising trend in healthcare development. The potential\nof ChatGPT to address the triage problem in emergency departments has been\nexamined, while few studies have explored its application in outpatient\ndepartments. With a focus on streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency\nfor outpatient triage, this study specifically aims to evaluate the consistency\nof responses provided by ChatGPT in outpatient guidance, including both\nwithin-version response analysis and between-version comparisons. For\nwithin-version, the results indicate that the internal response consistency for\nChatGPT-4.0 is significantly higher than ChatGPT-3.5 (p=0.03) and both have a\nmoderate consistency (71.2% for 4.0 and 59.6% for 3.5) in their top\nrecommendation. However, the between-version consistency is relatively low\n(mean consistency score=1.43/3, median=1), indicating few recommendations match\nbetween the two versions. Also, only 50% top recommendations match perfectly in\nthe comparisons. Interestingly, ChatGPT-3.5 responses are more likely to be\ncomplete than those from ChatGPT-4.0 (p=0.02), suggesting possible differences\nin information processing and response generation between the two versions. The\nfindings offer insights into AI-assisted outpatient operations, while also\nfacilitating the exploration of potentials and limitations of LLMs in\nhealthcare utilization. Future research may focus on carefully optimizing LLMs\nand AI integration in healthcare systems based on ergonomic and human factors\nprinciples, precisely aligning with the specific needs of effective outpatient\ntriage.",

In this work, we approach this question\nfor the first time by comparing the inductive bias of gradient descent (GD)\nwith that of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM). By studying a two-layer CNN,\nwe rigorously prove that SAM learns different features more uniformly,\nparticularly in early epochs. That is, SAM is less susceptible to simplicity\nbias compared to GD. We also show that examples containing features that are\nlearned early are separable from the rest based on the model's output. Based on\nthis observation, we propose a method that (i) clusters examples based on the\nnetwork output early in training, (ii) identifies a cluster of examples with\nsimilar network output, and (iii) upsamples the rest of examples only once to\nalleviate the simplicity bias. We show empirically that USEFUL effectively\nimproves the generalization performance on the original data distribution when\ntraining with various gradient methods, including (S)GD and SAM. Notably, we\ndemonstrate that our method can be combined with SAM variants and existing data\naugmentation strategies to achieve, to the best of our knowledge,\nstate-of-the-art performance for training ResNet18 on CIFAR10, STL10, CINIC10,\nTiny-ImageNet; ResNet34 on CIFAR100; and VGG19 and DenseNet121 on CIFAR10.",

    "abstract": "Big Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged as a crucial element in\nvarious intelligent applications at the edge, such as voice assistants in smart\nhomes and autonomous robotics in smart factories. Training big AI models, e.g.,\nfor personalized fine-tuning and continual model refinement, poses significant\nchallenges to edge devices due to the inherent conflict between limited\ncomputing resources and intensive workload associated with training. Despite\nthe constraints of on-device training, traditional approaches usually resort to\naggregating training data and sending it to a remote cloud for centralized\ntraining. Nevertheless, this approach is neither sustainable, which strains\nlong-range backhaul transmission and energy-consuming datacenters, nor safely\nprivate, which shares users' raw data with remote infrastructures. To address\nthese challenges, we alternatively observe that prevalent edge environments\nusually contain a diverse collection of trusted edge devices with untapped idle\nresources, which can be leveraged for edge training acceleration. Motivated by\nthis, in this article, we propose collaborative edge training, a novel training\nmechanism that orchestrates a group of trusted edge devices as a resource pool\nfor expedited, sustainable big AI model training at the edge. As an initial\nstep, we present a comprehensive framework for building collaborative edge\ntraining systems and analyze in-depth its merits and sustainable scheduling\nchoices following its workflow. To further investigate the impact of its\nparallelism design, we empirically study a case of four typical parallelisms\nfrom the perspective of energy demand with realistic testbeds.

    "abstract": "CLIP showcases exceptional cross-modal matching capabilities due to its\ntraining on image-text contrastive learning tasks. However, without specific\noptimization for unimodal scenarios, its performance in single-modality feature\nextraction might be suboptimal. Despite this, some studies have directly used\nCLIP's image encoder for tasks like few-shot classification, introducing a\nmisalignment between its pre-training objectives and feature extraction\nmethods. This inconsistency can diminish the quality of the image's feature\nrepresentation, adversely affecting CLIP's effectiveness in target tasks. In\nthis paper, we view text features as precise neighbors of image features in\nCLIP's space and present a novel CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation(CODER)\nbased on the distance structure between images and their neighbor texts. This\nfeature extraction method aligns better with CLIP's pre-training objectives,\nthereby fully leveraging CLIP's robust cross-modal capabilities. The key to\nconstruct a high-quality CODER lies in how to create a vast amount of\nhigh-quality and diverse texts to match with images. We introduce the Auto Text\nGenerator(ATG) to automatically generate the required texts in a data-free and\ntraining-free manner.

Although there has been\nsignificant research effort to improve image sample quality, there is little\nwork on representation-controlled generation using diffusion models.\nSpecifically, causal modeling and controllable counterfactual generation using\nDPMs is an underexplored area. In this work, we propose CausalDiffAE, a\ndiffusion-based causal representation learning framework to enable\ncounterfactual generation according to a specified causal model. Our key idea\nis to use an encoder to extract high-level semantically meaningful causal\nvariables from high-dimensional data and model stochastic variation using\nreverse diffusion. We propose a causal encoding mechanism that maps\nhigh-dimensional data to causally related latent factors and parameterize the\ncausal mechanisms among latent factors using neural networks. To enforce the\ndisentanglement of causal variables, we formulate a variational objective and\nleverage auxiliary label information in a prior to regularize the latent space.\nWe propose a DDIM-based counterfactual generation procedure subject to\ndo-interventions. Finally, to address the limited label supervision scenario,\nwe also study the application of CausalDiffAE when a part of the training data\nis unlabeled, which also enables granular control over the strength of\ninterventions in generating counterfactuals during inference.

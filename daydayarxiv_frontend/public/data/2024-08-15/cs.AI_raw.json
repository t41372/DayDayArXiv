    "abstract": "Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it\nhelps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in\nthe underlying data distribution that could affect the prediction results of\nmachine learning models. However, current methods have limitations in detecting\ndrift, for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair\ncomparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect\ndistributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and\nfine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for\nreal-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming\nimages and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a\npre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using\nmammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%.\nCombining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation\ndemonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide\ngreater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the\nsensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1%\nsalt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise\n(e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods\noffer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of\ndiagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.",

Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped\ndue to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral\ndatasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale\nmulti-temporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models\nleveraging data from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP).\nSpectralEarth comprises 538,974 image patches covering 415,153 unique locations\nfrom more than 11,636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of\narchive. Additionally, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps,\nenabling multi-temporal HSI analysis.

We integrate a spectral adapter into classical vision\nbackbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we\nconstruct four downstream datasets for land-cover and crop-type mapping,\nproviding benchmarks for model evaluation.

    "abstract": "In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA),\nlarge language models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers,\nrelying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this\nlimitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by\nretrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the\nretriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity\nof ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human\nannotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training\nsignals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the\nretriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we\nrerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability\nthat the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each\npassage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning\nexamples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four\npublicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances\nboth retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving\nresults comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.",

Although recent advances of\nmultimodal machine learning models offer a \\textit{semantic} index, the\nso-called \\textit{embedding vectors} mapped from the original multimodal data,\nthe dimension of the resulting embedding vectors are usually on the order of\nhundreds or a thousand, which are impractically high for time-sensitive\nscientific applications.\n  This work proposes to reduce the dimensionality of the output embedding\nvectors such that the set of top-$k$ nearest neighbors do not change in the\nlower-dimensional space, namely Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR). In\norder to develop such an OPDR method, our central hypothesis is that by\nanalyzing the intrinsic relationship among key parameters during the\ndimension-reduction map, a quantitative function may be constructed to reveal\nthe correlation between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables.\nTo demonstrate the hypothesis, this paper first defines a formal measure\nfunction to quantify the KNN similarity for a specific vector, then extends the\nmeasure into an aggregate accuracy of the global metric spaces, and finally\nderives a closed-form function between the target (lower) dimensionality and\nother variables.

We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of our tool and show important latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs\nfor different amounts of pruning and int8 quantization with Facebook Data\nEfficient Image Transformer (DeiT) models.

We describe a newly forming research\narea, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically\ncreate powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building\nblocks and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is\nan unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in\ncode and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming\never better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete,\nthis approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic\nsystem: including novel prompts, tool use, workflows, and combinations thereof.\nWe present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to\ndemonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new\nagents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through\nextensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and\nmath, we show that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel\ndesigns that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents.\nImportantly, we consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented\nby Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across\ndomains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality.

Its integration into safe\nclinical decision-making support requires robust and reliable models. However,\nreal-world data comes with diversities that often lie outside the intended\nsource distribution. Moreover, when test samples are dramatically different,\nclinical decision-making is greatly affected. Quantifying predictive\nuncertainty in models is crucial for well-calibrated predictions and\ndetermining when (or not) to trust a model. Unfortunately, many works have\noverlooked the importance of predictive uncertainty estimation. This paper\nevaluates whether predictive uncertainty estimation adds robustness to deep\nlearning-based diagnostic decision-making systems. We investigate the effect of\nvarious carcinoma distribution shift scenarios on predictive performance and\ncalibration. We first systematically investigate three popular methods for\nimproving predictive uncertainty: Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble, and\nfew-shot learning on lung adenocarcinoma classification as a primary disease in\nwhole slide images. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness of the methods in\nterms of performance and calibration under clinically relevant distribution\nshifts such as in-distribution shifts comprising primary disease sub-types and\nother characterization analysis data; out-of-distribution shifts comprising\nwell-differentiated cases, different organ origin, and imaging modality shifts.\nWhile studies on uncertainty estimation exist, to our best knowledge, no\nrigorous large-scale benchmark compares predictive uncertainty estimation\nincluding these dataset shifts for lung carcinoma classification.",

In this game, QBot's objective is to locate a concealed image\nsolely through a series of visually related questions posed to ABot. However,\neffectively modeling visually related reasoning in QBot's decision-making\nprocess poses a significant challenge. Current approaches either lack visual\ninformation or rely on a single real image sampled at each round as decoding\ncontext, both of which are inadequate for visual reasoning. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel approach that focuses on visually related\nreasoning through the use of a mental model of the undisclosed image. Within\nthis framework, QBot learns to represent mental imagery, enabling robust visual\nreasoning by tracking the dialogue state. The dialogue state comprises a\ncollection of representations of mental imagery, as well as representations of\nthe entities involved in the conversation. At each round, QBot engages in\nvisually related reasoning using the dialogue state to construct an internal\nrepresentation, generate relevant questions, and update both the dialogue state\nand internal representation upon receiving an answer.

To answer this question, we aim to assess the diagnostic\nperformance of LLMs in rare diseases, and explore methods to enhance their\neffectiveness in this area. In this work, we introduce a rare disease\nquestion-answering (ReDis-QA) dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in\ndiagnosing rare diseases.

Based on\nthe ReDis-QA dataset, we benchmarked several open-source LLMs, revealing that\ndiagnosing rare diseases remains a significant challenge for these models.\n  To facilitate retrieval augmentation generation for rare disease diagnosis,\nwe collect the first rare diseases corpus (ReCOP), sourced from the National\nOrganization for Rare Disorders (NORD) database. Specifically, we split the\nreport of each rare disease into multiple chunks, each representing a different\nproperty of the disease, including their overview, symptoms, causes, effects,\nrelated disorders, diagnosis, and standard therapies. This structure ensures\nthat the information within each chunk aligns consistently with a question.\nExperiment results demonstrate that ReCOP can effectively improve the accuracy\nof LLMs on the ReDis-QA dataset by an average of 8%.

Large language models (LLMs) have\nbecome a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task\nlearning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning\nfor sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in\nmanaging diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in\nmulti-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics,\nfurther complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO)\nmodule. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be\nseamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible\nsolution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is\ndynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to\ndifferent tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics\nduring training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text\ndataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance.\nSpecifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy\n(ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.",

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is\nan urgent need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings.\nThis is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the\nmodels have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics\nprograms, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic\nreasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs\nprocedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in\ngeneral program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new\nlayer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer\ndifferent-grained semantic-level questions of the images or 3D geometries\nwithout a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs,\nLLMs would need to possess the ability to \"imagine\" and reason how the\ncorresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description.\nWe use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the\nsemantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally\nwith minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of\nimages that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing\nsignificant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and\nopen-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about\nvisual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning\ngenerally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this\nability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned\nwith pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs.\nInterestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on\nsymbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various\nother benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, continual learning with pre-training (CLPT) has received\nwidespread interest, instead of its traditional focus of training from scratch.\nThe use of strong pre-trained models (PTMs) can greatly facilitate knowledge\ntransfer and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but also suffers from\nprogressive overfitting of pre-trained knowledge into specific downstream\ntasks. A majority of current efforts often keep the PTMs frozen and incorporate\ntask-specific prompts to instruct representation learning, coupled with a\nprompt selection process for inference. However, due to the limited capacity of\nprompt parameters, this strategy demonstrates only sub-optimal performance in\ncontinual learning. In comparison, tuning all parameters of PTMs often provides\nthe greatest potential for representation learning, making sequential\nfine-tuning (Seq FT) a fundamental baseline that has been overlooked in CLPT.\nTo this end, we present an in-depth analysis of the progressive overfitting\nproblem from the lens of Seq FT. Considering that the overly fast\nrepresentation learning and the biased classification layer constitute this\nparticular problem, we introduce the advanced Slow Learner with Classifier\nAlignment (SLCA++) framework to unleash the power of Seq FT, serving as a\nstrong baseline approach for CLPT. Our approach involves a Slow Learner to\nselectively reduce the learning rate of backbone parameters, and a Classifier\nAlignment to align the disjoint classification layers in a post-hoc fashion. We\nfurther enhance the efficacy of SL with a symmetric cross-entropy loss, as well\nas employ a parameter-efficient strategy to implement Seq FT with SLCA++.\nAcross a variety of continual learning scenarios on image classification\nbenchmarks, our approach provides substantial improvements and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for\nspecifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks.

Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we\nintroduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary\nsteps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we\nconstruct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI\no1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini\n1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images,\nmolecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely\ngenerating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward\nfunctions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing\nmethods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models\n(\\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally\nexpensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free\nguidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to\naddress these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that\nintegrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy\nstates lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference\nprocedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids\nfine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct\ndifferentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize\nnon-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific\ndomains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a\nprincipled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm\nacross several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and\nDNA/RNA sequence generation.

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role in storing diverse linguistic and\nfactual knowledge. Conventional methods frequently face challenges due to\nknowledge confusion stemming from their monolithic and redundant architectures,\nwhich calls for more efficient solutions with minimal computational overhead,\nparticularly for LLMs. In this paper, we explore the FFN computation paradigm\nin LLMs and introduce FactorLLM, a novel approach that decomposes well-trained\ndense FFNs into sparse sub-networks without requiring any further\nmodifications, while maintaining the same level of performance. Furthermore, we\nembed a router from the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), combined with our devised\nPrior-Approximate (PA) loss term that facilitates the dynamic activation of\nexperts and knowledge adaptation, thereby accelerating computational processes\nand enhancing performance using minimal training data and fine-tuning steps.\nFactorLLM thus enables efficient knowledge factorization and activates select\ngroups of experts specifically tailored to designated tasks, emulating the\ninteractive functional segmentation of the human brain. Extensive experiments\nacross various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nFactorLLM which achieves comparable performance to the source model securing up\nto 85% model performance while obtaining over a 30% increase in inference\nspeed.

The learned KG embeddings are typically used to\nanswer queries by ranking all potential answers, but rankings often lack a\nmeaningful probabilistic interpretation - lower-ranked answers do not\nnecessarily have a lower probability of being true. This limitation makes it\ndifficult to quantify uncertainty of model's predictions, posing challenges for\nthe application of KGE methods in high-stakes domains like medicine. We address\nthis issue by applying the theory of conformal prediction that allows\ngenerating answer sets, which contain the correct answer with probabilistic\nguarantees. We explain how conformal prediction can be used to generate such\nanswer sets for link prediction tasks. Our empirical evaluation on four\nbenchmark datasets using six representative KGE methods validates that the\ngenerated answer sets satisfy the probabilistic guarantees given by the theory\nof conformal prediction.

However, in practice, these collected sequences are\noften contaminated by noisy interactions, which significantly impairs\nrecommendation performance. Accurately identifying such noisy interactions\nwithout additional information is particularly challenging due to the absence\nof explicit supervisory signals indicating noise. Large Language Models (LLMs),\nequipped with extensive open knowledge and semantic reasoning abilities, offer\na promising avenue to bridge this information gap. However, employing LLMs for\ndenoising in sequential recommendation presents notable challenges: 1) Direct\napplication of pretrained LLMs may not be competent for the denoising task,\nfrequently generating nonsensical responses; 2) Even after fine-tuning, the\nreliability of LLM outputs remains questionable, especially given the\ncomplexity of the denoising task and the inherent hallucinatory issue of LLMs.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4DSR, a tailored approach for\ndenoising sequential recommendation using LLMs. We constructed a\nself-supervised fine-tuning task to activate LLMs' capabilities to identify\nnoisy items and suggest replacements. Furthermore, we developed an uncertainty\nestimation module that ensures only high-confidence responses are utilized for\nsequence corrections. Remarkably, LLM4DSR is model-agnostic, allowing corrected\nsequences to be flexibly applied across various recommendation models.\nExtensive experiments validate the superiority of LLM4DSR over existing\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Large code models (LCMs), pre-trained on vast code corpora, have demonstrated\nremarkable performance across a wide array of code-related tasks. Supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) plays a vital role in aligning these models with specific\nrequirements and enhancing their performance in particular domains. However,\nsynthesizing high-quality SFT datasets poses a significant challenge due to the\nuneven quality of datasets and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets.\n  Inspired by APIs as high-level abstractions of code that encapsulate rich\nsemantic information in a concise structure, we propose DataScope, an\nAPI-guided dataset synthesis framework designed to enhance the SFT process for\nLCMs in both general and domain-specific scenarios. DataScope comprises two\nmain components: Dsel and Dgen. On one hand, Dsel employs API coverage as a\ncore metric, enabling efficient dataset synthesis in general scenarios by\nselecting subsets of existing (uneven-quality) datasets with higher API\ncoverage. On the other hand, Dgen recasts domain dataset synthesis as a process\nof using API-specified high-level functionality and deliberately-constituted\ncode skeletons to synthesize concrete code.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate DataScope's effectiveness, with models\nfine-tuned on its synthesized datasets outperforming those tuned on unoptimized\ndatasets five times larger. Furthermore, a series of analyses on model\ninternals, relevant hyperparameters, and case studies provide additional\nevidence for the efficacy of our proposed methods. These findings underscore\nthe significance of dataset quality in SFT and advance the field of LCMs by\nproviding an efficient, cost-effective framework for constructing high-quality\ndatasets. This contribution enhances performance across both general and\ndomain-specific scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and tailored LCMs.",

    "abstract": "To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative\ntasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language\ncommands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in\nmultiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient\nmulti-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical\nspecifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive\nfrom human instructions. We propose Nl2Hltl2Plan, a framework that translates\nnatural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and\nsolves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions\ninto a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next,\na fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are\naggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level\ncorresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with\noff-the-shelf planners. Our Nl2Hltl2Plan demonstrates the potential of LLMs in\nhierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation\nand real-world experiments with human participants show that Nl2Hltl2Plan\noutperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while\nachieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.\nAdditional details are available at https://nl2hltl2plan.github.io .",

    "abstract": "People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening\ngait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses.\nExisting clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour\nvariations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within\nclinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a\ncomponent step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of\ndisease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach\nto automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos\nand calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise\nstate-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided\nTransformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people\nwith PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of\nunscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also\ncurate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human\npose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous\ngait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating\nscripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings\nwhere complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to\ndifficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting,\nwe quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\\circ$ based on the manual\nlabelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation\naccuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\\deg}, and a weighted\nprecision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the\nuse of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home\nsetting.",

Finally, we propose a VcCoT strategy that better highlights\nvisual cues, and our results confirm its efficacy in enhancing multimodal\ncausal reasoning.

    "abstract": "Downlink channel temporal prediction is a critical technology in massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, existing methods that\nrely on fixed-step historical sequences significantly limit the accuracy,\npracticality, and scalability of channel prediction. Recent advances have shown\nthat large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong pattern recognition and\nreasoning abilities over complex sequences. The challenge lies in effectively\naligning wireless communication data with the modalities used in natural\nlanguage processing to fully harness these capabilities. In this work, we\nintroduce Csi-LLM, a novel LLM-powered downlink channel prediction technique\nthat models variable-step historical sequences. To ensure effective\ncross-modality application, we align the design and training of Csi-LLM with\nthe processing of natural language tasks, leveraging the LLM's next-token\ngeneration capability for predicting the next step in channel state information\n(CSI). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this alignment\nstrategy, with Csi-LLM consistently delivering stable performance improvements\nacross various scenarios and showing significant potential in continuous\nmulti-step prediction.",

A key challenge here is the absence\nof complete geometric descriptions of the target objects from such simple click\nannotations. To address this issue, our proposed SC3D adopts a progressive\npipeline.

Next, we propose a mix-supervised teacher model, enabling the\ndetector to learn mixed supervision information.

Our core goal is to enable lawyer agents to learn how to argue a\ncase, as well as improving their overall legal skills, through courtroom\nprocess simulation. To achieve this goal, we propose an adversarial\nevolutionary approach for the lawyer-agent. Since AgentCourt can simulate the\noccurrence and development of court hearings based on a knowledge base and LLM,\nthe lawyer agents can continuously learn and accumulate experience from real\ncourt cases. The simulation experiments show that after two lawyer-agents have\nengaged in a thousand adversarial legal cases in AgentCourt (which can take a\ndecade for real-world lawyers), compared to their pre-evolutionary state, the\nevolved lawyer agents exhibit consistent improvement in their ability to handle\nlegal tasks. To enhance the credibility of our experimental results, we\nenlisted a panel of professional lawyers to evaluate our simulations. The\nevaluation indicates that the evolved lawyer agents exhibit notable\nadvancements in responsiveness, as well as expertise and logical rigor.

    "abstract": "Current works focus on addressing the remote sensing change detection task\nusing bi-temporal images. Although good performance can be achieved, however,\nseldom of they consider the motion cues which may also be vital. In this work,\nwe revisit the widely adopted bi-temporal images-based framework and propose a\nnovel Coarse-grained Temporal Mining Augmented (CTMA) framework. To be\nspecific, given the bi-temporal images, we first transform them into a video\nusing interpolation operations. Then, a set of temporal encoders is adopted to\nextract the motion features from the obtained video for coarse-grained changed\nregion prediction. Subsequently, we design a novel Coarse-grained Foregrounds\nAugmented Spatial Encoder module to integrate both global and local\ninformation. We also introduce a motion augmented strategy that leverages\nmotion cues as an additional output to aggregate with the spatial features for\nimproved results. Meanwhile, we feed the input image pairs into the ResNet to\nget the different features and also the spatial blocks for fine-grained feature\nlearning. More importantly, we propose a mask augmented strategy that utilizes\ncoarse-grained changed regions, incorporating them into the decoder blocks to\nenhance the final changed prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed\nframework for remote sensing image change detection.

    "abstract": "The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an\nera of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and\nintelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental\nmodules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information\nsharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These\nmodules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge\nlearning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is\ninterdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and\nbandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation\n(ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge,\nbut they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To\novercome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that\ncomprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This\nintegrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and\nComputation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task\nperformance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and\nrelated techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and\nlimitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC.\nSubsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network\nresource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored.\nFurthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie\nahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved\nissues requiring further investigation.

Recently, numerous foundation models have\ndemonstrated high suitability for few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot\nlearning (ZSL), potentially making them more accessible to practitioners.\nHowever, it remains unclear which foundation model performs best on FSL medical\nimage analysis tasks and what the optimal methods are for learning from limited\ndata. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of ZSL and FSL using 16\npretrained foundation models on 19 diverse medical imaging datasets. Our\nresults indicate that BiomedCLIP, a model pretrained exclusively on medical\ndata, performs best on average for very small training set sizes, while very\nlarge CLIP models pretrained on LAION-2B perform best with slightly more\ntraining samples. However, simply fine-tuning a ResNet-18 pretrained on\nImageNet performs similarly with more than five training examples per class.\nOur findings also highlight the need for further research on foundation models\nspecifically tailored for medical applications and the collection of more\ndatasets to train these models.",

Using specially developed\nExplainable AI techniques, we show for the first time that CH effects are\nwidespread in unsupervised learning. Our empirical findings are enriched by\ntheoretical insights, which interestingly point to inductive biases in the\nunsupervised learning machine as a primary source of CH effects.

To address the challenges, we propose a novel\ngradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on\n\\textbf{S}hort-\\textbf{T}erm \\textbf{I}nvariance using \\textbf{C}onvolutional\nneural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data.\nSpecifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance\nof causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of\nindependence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two\ncausal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and\nmechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To\ndemonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery\nfrom time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between\nconvolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under\nthe assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable.

Recently,\nconditional flow matching (CFM) generative models have been successfully\nadopted for waveform generation tasks, leveraging a single vector field\nestimation objective for training. Although these models can generate\nhigh-fidelity waveform signals, they require significantly more ODE steps\ncompared to GAN-based models, which only need a single generation step.\nAdditionally, the generated samples often lack high-frequency information due\nto noisy vector field estimation, which fails to ensure high-frequency\nreproduction. To address this limitation, we enhance pre-trained CFM-based\ngenerative models by incorporating a fixed-step generator modification. We\nutilized reconstruction losses and adversarial feedback to accelerate\nhigh-fidelity waveform generation. Through adversarial flow matching\noptimization, it only requires 1,000 steps of fine-tuning to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance across various objective metrics. Moreover, we\nsignificantly reduce inference speed from 16 steps to 2 or 4 steps.\nAdditionally, by scaling up the backbone of PeriodWave from 29M to 70M\nparameters for improved generalization, PeriodWave-Turbo achieves unprecedented\nperformance, with a perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score of\n4.454 on the LibriTTS dataset.

    "abstract": "Knowledge-based visual question answering requires external knowledge beyond\nvisible content to answer the question correctly. One limitation of existing\nmethods is that they focus more on modeling the inter-modal and intra-modal\ncorrelations, which entangles complex multimodal clues by implicit embeddings\nand lacks interpretability and generalization ability. The key challenge to\nsolve the above problem is to separate the information and process it\nseparately at the functional level. By reusing each processing unit, the\ngeneralization ability of the model to deal with different data can be\nincreased. In this paper, we propose Independent Inference Units (IIU) for\nfine-grained multi-modal reasoning to decompose intra-modal information by the\nfunctionally independent units. Specifically, IIU processes each\nsemantic-specific intra-modal clue by an independent inference unit, which also\ncollects complementary information by communication from different units. To\nfurther reduce the impact of redundant information, we propose a memory update\nmodule to maintain semantic-relevant memory along with the reasoning process\ngradually. In comparison with existing non-pretrained multi-modal reasoning\nmodels on standard datasets, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art,\nenhancing performance by 3%, and surpassing basic pretrained multi-modal\nmodels. The experimental results show that our IIU model is effective in\ndisentangling intra-modal clues as well as reasoning units to provide\nexplainable reasoning evidence.

In safe RL, the goal is to maximize reward\nperformance while minimizing constraints, often achieved by setting bounds on\nconstraint functions and utilizing the Lagrangian method. However, deploying\nLagrangian-based safe RL in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the\nnecessity of threshold fine-tuning, as imprecise adjustments may lead to\nsuboptimal policy convergence. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a unified\nLagrangian-based model-free architecture called Meta Soft Actor-Critic\nLagrangian (Meta SAC-Lag). Meta SAC-Lag uses meta-gradient optimization to\nautomatically update the safety-related hyperparameters. The proposed method is\ndesigned to address safe exploration and threshold adjustment with minimal\nhyperparameter tuning requirement. In our pipeline, the inner parameters are\nupdated through the conventional formulation and the hyperparameters are\nadjusted using the meta-objectives which are defined based on the updated\nparameters. Our results show that the agent can reliably adjust the safety\nperformance due to the relatively fast convergence rate of the safety\nthreshold. We evaluate the performance of Meta SAC-Lag in five simulated\nenvironments against Lagrangian baselines, and the results demonstrate its\ncapability to create synergy between parameters, yielding better or competitive\nresults. Furthermore, we conduct a real-world experiment involving a robotic\narm tasked with pouring coffee into a cup without spillage.

RandomNet uses different sets of random\nweights to extract diverse representations of time series and then ensembles\nthe clustering relationships derived from these different representations to\nbuild the final clustering results. By extracting diverse representations, our\nmodel can effectively handle time series with different characteristics. Since\nall parameters are randomly generated, no training is required during the\nprocess. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of the method.\nTo validate its performance, we conduct extensive experiments on all of the 128\ndatasets in the well-known UCR time series archive and perform statistical\nanalysis of the results. These datasets have different sizes, sequence lengths,\nand they are from diverse fields. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method is competitive compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Recently, the\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in\nimage and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to\nthe high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex\nand long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to\nutilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate\nreal-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages\nthe memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames,\nreducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high\nsegmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2\nsignificantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to\nthe vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\\times$ FPS compared with\nSAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with\nlower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model\nfor surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in\nresource-constrained environments a reality.

It also allows\nspotting issues with incorrect function names with the help of parsing checks\nthat can be run on code. Progress in Code Generation methodologies, however,\nremains limited to general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python. LLMs\ncontinue to face challenges with custom function names in Domain Specific\nLanguages or DSLs, leading to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors.\nThis is more common for custom function names, that are typically part of the\nplan. Moreover, keeping LLMs up-to-date with newer function names is an issue.\nThis poses a challenge for scenarios like task planning over a large number of\nAPIs, since the plan is represented as a DSL having custom API names. In this\npaper, we focus on workflow automation in RPA (Robotic Process Automation)\ndomain as a special case of task planning. We present optimizations for using\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along with\nan ablation study comparing these strategies with a fine-tuned model.

    "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention\nfor its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby\nenriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs. Existing\ngraph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in\ndeveloping evolving representations for both entities and relational\nembeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these\nmodels to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious\ncorrelations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between\nevents. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false\ncorrelations. To address this, we propose an innovative Causal Enhanced Graph\nRepresentation Learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework\nintroduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil\nthe essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing the\nperformance of the TKGR task. Specifically, we first disentangle the\nevolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal knowledge\ngraph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and\nconfounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we\nadvocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to\nmitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features,\nthus achieving more robust and accurate predictions.

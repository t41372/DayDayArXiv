    "abstract": "Safe reinforcement learning tasks are a challenging domain despite being very\ncommon in the real world. The widely adopted CMDP model constrains the risks in\nexpectation, which makes room for dangerous behaviors in long-tail states. In\nsafety-critical domains, such behaviors could lead to disastrous outcomes. To\naddress this issue, we first describe the problem with a stronger Uniformly\nConstrained MDP (UCMDP) model where we impose constraints on all reachable\nstates; we then propose Objective Suppression, a novel method that adaptively\nsuppresses the task reward maximizing objectives according to a safety critic,\nas a solution to the Lagrangian dual of a UCMDP. We benchmark Objective\nSuppression in two multi-constraint safety domains, including an autonomous\ndriving domain where any incorrect behavior can lead to disastrous\nconsequences. On the driving domain, we evaluate on open source and proprietary\ndata and evaluate transfer to a real autonomous fleet. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed method, when combined with existing safe RL\nalgorithms, can match the task reward achieved by baselines with significantly\nfewer constraint violations.",

BEAST employs\ninterpretable parameters, enabling attackers to balance between attack speed,\nsuccess rate, and the readability of adversarial prompts. The computational\nefficiency of BEAST facilitates us to investigate its applications on LMs for\njailbreaking, eliciting hallucinations, and privacy attacks. Our gradient-free\ntargeted attack can jailbreak aligned LMs with high attack success rates within\none minute. For instance, BEAST can jailbreak Vicuna-7B-v1.5 under one minute\nwith a success rate of 89% when compared to a gradient-based baseline that\ntakes over an hour to achieve 70% success rate using a single Nvidia RTX A6000\n48GB GPU. Additionally, we discover a unique outcome wherein our untargeted\nattack induces hallucinations in LM chatbots. Through human evaluations, we\nfind that our untargeted attack causes Vicuna-7B-v1.5 to produce ~15% more\nincorrect outputs when compared to LM outputs in the absence of our attack. We\nalso learn that 22% of the time, BEAST causes Vicuna to generate outputs that\nare not relevant to the original prompt. Further, we use BEAST to generate\nadversarial prompts in a few seconds that can boost the performance of existing\nmembership inference attacks for LMs. We believe that our fast attack, BEAST,\nhas the potential to accelerate research in LM security and privacy.

In reinforcement learning (RL), however, finding a truly general and\nscalable unsupervised pre-training objective for generalist policies from\noffline data remains a major open question. While a number of methods have been\nproposed to enable generic self-supervised RL, based on principles such as\ngoal-conditioned RL, behavioral cloning, and unsupervised skill learning, such\nmethods remain limited in terms of either the diversity of the discovered\nbehaviors, the need for high-quality demonstration data, or the lack of a clear\nadaptation mechanism for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel\nunsupervised framework to pre-train generalist policies that capture diverse,\noptimal, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline data such that they can\nbe quickly adapted to any arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. Our key\ninsight is to learn a structured representation that preserves the temporal\nstructure of the underlying environment, and then to span this learned latent\nspace with directional movements, which enables various zero-shot policy\n\"prompting\" schemes for downstream tasks. Through our experiments on simulated\nrobotic locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, we show that our unsupervised\npolicies can solve goal-conditioned and general RL tasks in a zero-shot\nfashion, even often outperforming prior methods designed specifically for each\nsetting.

Previous studies have reported the occurrence of grokking in specific\ncontrolled settings, such as DNNs initialized with large-norm parameters or\ntransformers trained on algorithmic datasets. We demonstrate that grokking is\nactually much more widespread and materializes in a wide range of practical\nsettings, such as training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on CIFAR10\nor a Resnet on Imagenette. We introduce the new concept of delayed robustness,\nwhereby a DNN groks adversarial examples and becomes robust, long after\ninterpolation and/or generalization. We develop an analytical explanation for\nthe emergence of both delayed generalization and delayed robustness based on\nthe local complexity of a DNN's input-output mapping. Our local complexity\nmeasures the density of so-called linear regions (aka, spline partition\nregions) that tile the DNN input space and serves as a utile progress measure\nfor training. We provide the first evidence that, for classification problems,\nthe linear regions undergo a phase transition during training whereafter they\nmigrate away from the training samples (making the DNN mapping smoother there)\nand towards the decision boundary (making the DNN mapping less smooth there).\nGrokking occurs post phase transition as a robust partition of the input space\nthanks to the linearization of the DNN mapping around the training points.\nWebsite: https://bit.ly/grok-adversarial",

In this paper, we propose to address this challenge\nby harnessing a diverse set of specialized teachers, instead of a single\ngeneralist one, that collectively supervises the strong student. Our approach\nresembles the classical hierarchical mixture of experts, with two components\ntailored for co-supervision: (i) we progressively alternate student training\nand teacher assignment, leveraging the growth of the strong student to identify\nplausible supervisions; (ii) we conservatively enforce teacher-student and\nlocal-global consistency, leveraging their dependencies to reject potential\nannotation noises.

    "abstract": "Recent text-to-image diffusion models are able to learn and synthesize images\ncontaining novel, personalized concepts (e.g., their own pets or specific\nitems) with just a few examples for training. This paper tackles two\ninterconnected issues within this realm of personalizing text-to-image\ndiffusion models. First, current personalization techniques fail to reliably\nextend to multiple concepts -- we hypothesize this to be due to the mismatch\nbetween complex scenes and simple text descriptions in the pre-training dataset\n(e.g., LAION). Second, given an image containing multiple personalized\nconcepts, there lacks a holistic metric that evaluates performance on not just\nthe degree of resemblance of personalized concepts, but also whether all\nconcepts are present in the image and whether the image accurately reflects the\noverall text description. To address these issues, we introduce Gen4Gen, a\nsemi-automated dataset creation pipeline utilizing generative models to combine\npersonalized concepts into complex compositions along with text-descriptions.\nUsing this, we create a dataset called MyCanvas, that can be used to benchmark\nthe task of multi-concept personalization. In addition, we design a\ncomprehensive metric comprising two scores (CP-CLIP and TI-CLIP) for better\nquantifying the performance of multi-concept, personalized text-to-image\ndiffusion methods. We provide a simple baseline built on top of Custom\nDiffusion with empirical prompting strategies for future researchers to\nevaluate on MyCanvas. We show that by improving data quality and prompting\nstrategies, we can significantly increase multi-concept personalized image\ngeneration quality, without requiring any modifications to model architecture\nor training algorithms.",

These are intrinsic properties of\nthe robot's morphology, frequently observed in animal biology and robotics,\nwhich stem from the replication of kinematic structures and the symmetrical\ndistribution of mass. We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot's\nstate space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements,\nresulting in the equivariance of the robot's equations of motion and optimal\ncontrol policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and\npreviously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant\nimplications for both data-driven and analytical methods used in modeling,\ncontrol, estimation and design in robotics. For data-driven methods, we\ndemonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and\ngeneralization of machine learning models through data augmentation, or by\napplying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model's architecture. In the\ncontext of analytical methods, we employ abstract harmonic analysis to\ndecompose the robot's dynamics into a superposition of lower-dimensional,\nindependent dynamics. We substantiate our claims with both synthetic and\nreal-world experiments conducted on bipedal and quadrupedal robots.

In this study, we\nfirst introduce a probabilistic notion of T2I DMs' robustness; and then\nestablish an efficient framework, ProTIP, to evaluate it with statistical\nguarantees. The main challenges stem from: i) the high computational cost of\nthe generation process; and ii) determining if a perturbed input is an AE\ninvolves comparing two output distributions, which is fundamentally harder\ncompared to other DL tasks like classification where an AE is identified upon\nmisprediction of labels. To tackle the challenges, we employ sequential\nanalysis with efficacy and futility early stopping rules in the statistical\ntesting for identifying AEs, and adaptive concentration inequalities to\ndynamically determine the \"just-right\" number of stochastic perturbations\nwhenever the verification target is met. Empirical experiments validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of ProTIP over common T2I DMs. Finally, we\ndemonstrate an application of ProTIP to rank commonly used defence methods.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the link between urban planning and commuting flows is crucial\nfor guiding urban development and policymaking. This research, bridging\ncomputer science and urban studies, addresses the challenge of integrating\nthese fields with their distinct focuses. Traditional urban studies methods,\nlike the gravity and radiation models, often underperform in complex scenarios\ndue to their limited handling of multiple variables and reliance on overly\nsimplistic and unrealistic assumptions, such as spatial isotropy. While deep\nlearning models offer improved accuracy, their black-box nature poses a\ntrade-off between performance and explainability -- both vital for analyzing\ncomplex societal phenomena like commuting flows. To address this, we introduce\nTransFlower, an explainable, transformer-based model employing flow-to-flow\nattention to predict urban commuting patterns. It features a geospatial encoder\nwith an anisotropy-aware relative location encoder for nuanced flow\nrepresentation. Following this, the transformer-based flow predictor enhances\nthis by leveraging attention mechanisms to efficiently capture flow\ninteractions. Our model outperforms existing methods by up to 30.8% Common Part\nof Commuters, offering insights into mobility dynamics crucial for urban\nplanning and policy decisions.",

We further show\nthat on the full training distribution self-repair is imperfect, as the\noriginal direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and noisy, since the\ndegree of self-repair varies significantly across different prompts (sometimes\novercorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different\nmechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final\nLayerNorm scaling factor and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure.\nWe additionally discuss the implications of these results for interpretability\npractitioners and close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of\nwhy self-repair occurs in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the\nIterative Inference hypothesis in language models, a framework that predicts\nself-repair.",

Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to\napply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several\nrecent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However,\nthese approaches lack performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a new distributed LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning\nfor Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving\nuser-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging\nconformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool\nin black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about\nits inherent uncertainty in a distributed fashion, enabling robots to make\nindividual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help\notherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed\nplanner can achieve user-specified task success rates, assuming successful plan\nexecution, while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We provide\ncomparative experiments against related works showing that our method is\nsignificantly more computational efficient and achieves lower help rates.

A common approach is to place a Gaussian process\nprior on the unknown functions and allow evaluations only in regions that are\nsafe with high probability. Most current methods rely on a discretization of\nthe domain and cannot be directly extended to the continuous case. Moreover,\nthe way in which they exploit regularity assumptions about the constraint\nintroduces an additional critical hyperparameter. In this paper, we propose an\ninformation-theoretic safe exploration criterion that directly exploits the GP\nposterior to identify the most informative safe parameters to evaluate. The\ncombination of this exploration criterion with a well known Bayesian\noptimization acquisition function yields a novel safe Bayesian optimization\nselection criterion. Our approach is naturally applicable to continuous domains\nand does not require additional explicit hyperparameters.

On the quantum side, we propose a\nquantum-state-fidelity-based evaluation function to iteratively train the\nnetwork through a feedback loop between the two sides. co-TenQu has been\nimplemented and evaluated with both simulators and the IBM-Q platform.

These models, including ArabianGPT-0.1B and ArabianGPT-0.3B, vary in\nsize and complexity, aligning with the nuanced linguistic characteristics of\nArabic. The AraNizer tokenizer, integral to these models, addresses the unique\nmorphological aspects of Arabic script, ensuring more accurate text processing.\nEmpirical results from fine-tuning the models on tasks like sentiment analysis\nand summarization demonstrate significant improvements. For sentiment analysis,\nthe fine-tuned ArabianGPT-0.1B model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 95%, a\nsubstantial increase from the base model's 56%. Similarly, in summarization\ntasks, fine-tuned models showed enhanced F1 scores, indicating improved\nprecision and recall in generating concise summaries. Comparative analysis of\nfine-tuned ArabianGPT models against their base versions across various\nbenchmarks reveals nuanced differences in performance, with fine-tuning\npositively impacting specific tasks like question answering and summarization.\nThese findings underscore the efficacy of fine-tuning in aligning ArabianGPT\nmodels more closely with specific NLP tasks, highlighting the potential of\ntailored transformer architectures in advancing Arabic NLP.",

However, current NCO methods typically require building\none model for each routing problem, which significantly hinders their practical\napplication for real-world industry problems with diverse attributes. In this\nwork, we make the first attempt to tackle the crucial challenge of\ncross-problem generalization. In particular, we formulate VRPs as different\ncombinations of a set of shared underlying attributes and solve them\nsimultaneously via a single model through attribute composition. In this way,\nour proposed model can successfully solve VRPs with unseen attribute\ncombinations in a zero-shot generalization manner. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on eleven VRP variants, benchmark datasets, and industry logistic\nscenarios. The results show that the unified model demonstrates superior\nperformance in the eleven VRPs, reducing the average gap to around 5% from over\n20% in the existing approach and achieving a significant performance boost on\nbenchmark datasets as well as a real-world logistics application.

Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) are now the go-to\nsolution for image understanding, thanks to both their state-of-the-art\nperformance across a variety of tasks and the simplicity of a unified approach\nto training, fine-tuning, and inference. While VLMs obtain high performance on\nimage-based tasks, they perform poorly on handwriting recognition when applied\nnaively, i.e., by rendering handwriting as an image and performing optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR). In this paper, we study online handwriting\nrecognition with VLMs, going beyond naive OCR. We propose a novel tokenized\nrepresentation of digital ink (online handwriting) that includes both a\ntime-ordered sequence of strokes as text, and as image. We show that this\nrepresentation yields results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art\nonline handwriting recognizers.

    "abstract": "Existing models encounter bottlenecks in balancing performance and\ncomputational efficiency when modeling long sequences. Although the state space\nmodel (SSM) has achieved remarkable success in handling long sequence tasks, it\nstill faces the problem of large number of parameters. In order to further\nimprove the efficiency of SSM, we propose a new state space layer based on\nmultiple-input multiple-output SSM, called efficient SSM (eSSM). Our eSSM is\nbuilt on the convolutional representation of multi-input and multi-input (MIMO)\nSSM. We propose a variety of effective strategies to improve the computational\nefficiency. The diagonalization of the system matrix first decouples the\noriginal system. Then a fast tensor convolution is proposed based on the fast\nFourier transform. In addition, the block diagonalization of the SSM further\nreduces the model parameters and improves the model flexibility. Extensive\nexperimental results show that the performance of the proposed model on\nmultiple databases matches the performance of state-of-the-art models, such as\nS4, and is significantly better than Transformers and LSTM. In the model\nefficiency benchmark, the parameters of eSSM are only 12.89\\% of LSTM and\n13.24\\% of Mamba. The training speed of eSSM is 3.94 times faster than LSTM and\n1.35 times faster than Mamba. Code is available at:\n\\href{https://github.com/leonty1/essm}{https://github.com/leonty1/essm}.",

In light of the vulnerability of deep\nlearning detectors to subtle input file modifications, we propose a practical\ndefense against adversarial malware examples inspired by (de)randomized\nsmoothing. In this work, we reduce the chances of sampling adversarial content\ninjected by malware authors by selecting correlated subsets of bytes, rather\nthan using Gaussian noise to randomize inputs like in the Computer Vision (CV)\ndomain. During training, our ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base\nclassifier to make classifications on a subset of contiguous bytes or chunk of\nbytes. At test time, a large number of chunks are then classified by a base\nclassifier and the consensus among these classifications is then reported as\nthe final prediction. We propose two strategies to determine the location of\nthe chunks used for classification: (1) randomly selecting the locations of the\nchunks and (2) selecting contiguous adjacent chunks. To showcase the\neffectiveness of our approach, we have trained two classifiers with our\nchunk-based ablation schemes on the BODMAS dataset.

    "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable non-invasive tool\nfor monitoring brain activity. The classification of fNIRS data in relation to\nconscious activity holds significance for advancing our understanding of the\nbrain and facilitating the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Many\nresearchers have turned to deep learning to tackle the classification\nchallenges inherent in fNIRS data due to its strong generalization and\nrobustness. In the application of fNIRS, reliability is really important, and\none mathematical formulation of the reliability of confidence is calibration.\nHowever, many researchers overlook the important issue of calibration. To\naddress this gap, we propose integrating calibration into fNIRS field and\nassess the reliability of existing models. Surprisingly, our results indicate\npoor calibration performance in many proposed models. To advance calibration\ndevelopment in the fNIRS field, we summarize three practical tips. Through this\nletter, we hope to emphasize the critical role of calibration in fNIRS research\nand argue for enhancing the reliability of deep learning-based predictions in\nfNIRS classification tasks.

What information\nshould be stored in them? How to use them for the learning steps? As an\napproach to the last question, we introduce a general method called\n\"Retrospective Learning Law Correction\" or shortly RLLC. This method is\ndesigned to calculate a dynamically varying linear combination (called learning\nlaw) of memory units, which themselves may evolve arbitrarily. We demonstrate\nRLLC on optimizers whose memory units have linear update rules and small memory\n($\\leq 4$ memory units). Our experiments show that in a variety of standard\nproblems, these optimizers outperform the above mentioned three classical\noptimizers. We conclude that RLLC is a promising framework for boosting the\nperformance of known optimizers by adding more memory units and by making them\nmore adaptive.",

Merely filling in missing values with existing\nimputation methods and subsequently applying structure learning on the complete\ndata is empirically shown to be sub-optimal. To address this problem, we\npropose a score-based algorithm for learning causal structures from missing\ndata based on optimal transport. This optimal transport viewpoint diverges from\nexisting score-based approaches that are dominantly based on expectation\nmaximization. We formulate structure learning as a density fitting problem,\nwhere the goal is to find the causal model that induces a distribution of\nminimum Wasserstein distance with the observed data distribution.

In\nproduction environment, VFL usually involves one task party and one data party.\nFair and economically efficient feature trading is crucial to the\ncommercialization of VFL, where the task party is considered as the data\nconsumer who buys the data party's features. However, current VFL feature\ntrading practices often price the data party's data as a whole and assume\ntransactions occur prior to the performing VFL. Neglecting the performance\ngains resulting from traded features may lead to underpayment and overpayment\nissues. In this study, we propose a bargaining-based feature trading approach\nin VFL to encourage economically efficient transactions.

The partitioning strategy of conventional collaborative inference\nfails to reduce communication cost because of the inherent architecture of ViTs\nmaintaining consistent layer dimensions across the entire transformer encoder.\nTherefore, instead of employing the partitioning strategy, our framework\nutilizes a lightweight ViT model on the edge device, with the server deploying\na complicated ViT model. To enhance communication efficiency and achieve the\nclassification accuracy of the server model, we propose two strategies: 1)\nattention-aware patch selection and 2) entropy-aware image transmission.\nAttention-aware patch selection leverages the attention scores generated by the\nedge device's transformer encoder to identify and select the image patches\ncritical for classification. This strategy enables the edge device to transmit\nonly the essential patches to the server, significantly improving communication\nefficiency. Entropy-aware image transmission uses min-entropy as a metric to\naccurately determine whether to depend on the lightweight model on the edge\ndevice or to request the inference from the server model. In our framework, the\nlightweight ViT model on the edge device acts as a semantic encoder,\nefficiently identifying and selecting the crucial image information required\nfor the classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed\ncollaborative inference framework can reduce communication overhead by 68% with\nonly a minimal loss in accuracy compared to the server model on the ImageNet\ndataset.",

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of data, continual learning capability is\nincreasingly important for neural networks. Due to catastrophic forgetting,\nneural networks inevitably forget the knowledge of old tasks after learning new\nones. In visual classification scenario, a common practice of alleviating the\nforgetting is to constrain the backbone. However, the impact of classifiers is\nunderestimated. In this paper, we analyze the variation of model predictions in\nsequential binary classification tasks and find that the norm of the equivalent\none-class classifiers significantly affects the forgetting level. Based on this\nconclusion, we propose a two-stage continual learning algorithm named Fixed\nRandom Classifier Rearrangement (FRCR). In first stage, FRCR replaces the\nlearnable classifiers with fixed random classifiers, constraining the norm of\nthe equivalent one-class classifiers without affecting the performance of the\nnetwork. In second stage, FRCR rearranges the entries of new classifiers to\nimplicitly reduce the drift of old latent representations. The experimental\nresults on multiple datasets show that FRCR significantly mitigates the model\nforgetting; subsequent experimental analyses further validate the effectiveness\nof the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Although biomedical entity linking (BioEL) has made significant progress with\npre-trained language models, challenges still exist for fine-grained and\nlong-tailed entities. To address these challenges, we present BioELQA, a novel\nmodel that treats Biomedical Entity Linking as Multiple Choice Question\nAnswering. BioELQA first obtains candidate entities with a fast retriever,\njointly presents the mention and candidate entities to a generator, and then\noutputs the predicted symbol associated with its chosen entity. This\nformulation enables explicit comparison of different candidate entities, thus\ncapturing fine-grained interactions between mentions and entities, as well as\namong entities themselves. To improve generalization for long-tailed entities,\nwe retrieve similar labeled training instances as clues and concatenate the\ninput with retrieved instances for the generator. Extensive experimental\nresults show that BioELQA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on several\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "With the incorporation of the UNet architecture, diffusion probabilistic\nmodels have become a dominant force in image generation tasks. One key design\nin UNet is the skip connections between the encoder and decoder blocks.\nAlthough skip connections have been shown to improve training stability and\nmodel performance, we reveal that such shortcuts can be a limiting factor for\nthe complexity of the transformation. As the sampling steps decrease, the\ngeneration process and the role of the UNet get closer to the push-forward\ntransformations from Gaussian distribution to the target, posing a challenge\nfor the network's complexity. To address this challenge, we propose\nSkip-Tuning, a simple yet surprisingly effective training-free tuning method on\nthe skip connections. Our method can achieve 100% FID improvement for\npretrained EDM on ImageNet 64 with only 19 NFEs (1.75), breaking the limit of\nODE samplers regardless of sampling steps. Surprisingly, the improvement\npersists when we increase the number of sampling steps and can even surpass the\nbest result from EDM-2 (1.58) with only 39 NFEs (1.57). Comprehensive\nexploratory experiments are conducted to shed light on the surprising\neffectiveness. We observe that while Skip-Tuning increases the score-matching\nlosses in the pixel space, the losses in the feature space are reduced,\nparticularly at intermediate noise levels, which coincide with the most\neffective range accounting for image quality improvement.",

We show that traditional evaluation methods like threshold-based\nclassification metrics and error-based scoring rules assess a DNN's ability to\nreplicate the observed ground truth but fail to measure the DNN's learning of\nthe underlying stochastic process. To address this gap, we propose a new\nevaluation criterion called Fidelity to Stochastic Process (F2SP), representing\nthe DNN's ability to predict the system property Statistic-GT--the ground truth\nof the stochastic process--and introduce an evaluation metric that exclusively\nassesses F2SP. We formalize F2SP within a stochastic framework and establish\ncriteria for validly measuring it. We formally show that Expected Calibration\nError (ECE) satisfies the necessary condition for testing F2SP, unlike\ntraditional evaluation methods. Empirical experiments on synthetic datasets,\nincluding wildfire, host-pathogen, and stock market models, demonstrate that\nECE uniquely captures F2SP. We further extend our study to real-world wildfire\ndata, highlighting the limitations of conventional evaluation and discuss the\npractical utility of incorporating F2SP into model assessment.

    "abstract": "Episodic memory plays a crucial role in various cognitive processes, such as\nthe ability to mentally recall past events. While cognitive science emphasizes\nthe significance of spatial context in the formation and retrieval of episodic\nmemory, the current primary approach to implementing episodic memory in AI\nsystems is through transformers that store temporally ordered experiences,\nwhich overlooks the spatial dimension. As a result, it is unclear how the\nunderlying structure could be extended to incorporate the spatial axis beyond\ntemporal order alone and thereby what benefits can be obtained. To address\nthis, this paper explores the use of Spatially-Aware Transformer models that\nincorporate spatial information. These models enable the creation of\nplace-centric episodic memory that considers both temporal and spatial\ndimensions. Adopting this approach, we demonstrate that memory utilization\nefficiency can be improved, leading to enhanced accuracy in various\nplace-centric downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Memory\nAllocator, a memory management method based on reinforcement learning that aims\nto optimize efficiency of memory utilization.

However, current\nmodels still face limitations in dealing with linguistic variations in input\nqueries, such as paraphrases, making it challenging to handle a broad range of\nuser queries in real-world applications. In this study, we introduce a\nstraightforward fine-tuning approach to enhance the representations of CLIP\nmodels for paraphrases. Our approach involves a two-step paraphrase generation\nprocess, where we automatically create two categories of paraphrases from\nweb-scale image captions by leveraging large language models. Subsequently, we\nfine-tune the CLIP text encoder using these generated paraphrases while\nfreezing the image encoder. Our resulting model, which we call ParaCLIP,\nexhibits significant improvements over baseline CLIP models across various\ntasks, including paraphrased retrieval (with rank similarity scores improved by\nup to 2.0% and 5.6%), Visual Genome Relation and Attribution, as well as seven\nsemantic textual similarity tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the application of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for\npredicting mean-reverting time series with an underlying structure, using\nrelatively unexplored functional and augmented data structures. While many\nconventional forecasting methods concentrate on the short-term dynamics of time\nseries data, GPs offer the potential to forecast not just the average\nprediction but the entire probability distribution over a future trajectory.\nThis is particularly beneficial in financial contexts, where accurate\npredictions alone may not suffice if incorrect volatility assessments lead to\ncapital losses. Moreover, in trade selection, GPs allow for the forecasting of\nmultiple Sharpe ratios adjusted for transaction costs, aiding in\ndecision-making. The functional data representation utilized in this study\nenables longer-term predictions by leveraging information from previous years,\neven as the forecast moves away from the current year's training data.\nAdditionally, the augmented representation enriches the training set by\nincorporating multiple targets for future points in time, facilitating\nlong-term predictions. Our implementation closely aligns with the methodology\noutlined in, which assessed effectiveness on commodity futures. However, our\ntesting methodology differs. Instead of real data, we employ simulated data\nwith similar characteristics. We construct a testing environment to evaluate\nboth data representations and models under conditions of increasing noise, fat\ntails, and inappropriate kernels-conditions commonly encountered in practice.\nBy simulating data, we can compare our forecast distribution over time against\na full simulation of the actual distribution of our test set, thereby reducing\nthe inherent uncertainty in testing time series models on real data. We enable\nfeature prediction through augmentation and employ sub-sampling to ensure the\nfeasibility of GPs.",

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ\nreinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based\nauto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance\ndegradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can\ndeploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction\ndataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy.

    "abstract": "Hybrid Bayesian networks (HBN) contain complex conditional probabilistic\ndistributions (CPD) specified as partitioned expressions over discrete and\ncontinuous variables. The size of these CPDs grows exponentially with the\nnumber of parent nodes when using discrete inference, resulting in significant\ninefficiency. Normally, an effective way to reduce the CPD size is to use a\nbinary factorization (BF) algorithm to decompose the statistical or arithmetic\nfunctions in the CPD by factorizing the number of connected parent nodes to\nsets of size two. However, the BF algorithm was not designed to handle\npartitioned expressions. Hence, we propose a new algorithm called stacking\nfactorization (SF) to decompose the partitioned expressions. The SF algorithm\ncreates intermediate nodes to incrementally reconstruct the densities in the\noriginal partitioned expression, allowing no more than two continuous parent\nnodes to be connected to each child node in the resulting HBN. SF can be either\nused independently or combined with the BF algorithm.

    "abstract": "Automatic evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by\ndata contamination, leading to inflated assessments of their effectiveness.\nExisting strategies, which aim to detect contaminated texts, focus on\nquantifying contamination status instead of accurately gauging model\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce KIEval, a Knowledge-grounded\nInteractive Evaluation framework, which incorporates an LLM-powered\n\"interactor\" role for the first time to accomplish a dynamic\ncontamination-resilient evaluation. Starting with a question in a conventional\nLLM benchmark involving domain-specific knowledge, KIEval utilizes dynamically\ngenerated, multi-round, and knowledge-focused dialogues to determine whether a\nmodel's response is merely a recall of benchmark answers or demonstrates a deep\ncomprehension to apply knowledge in more complex conversations. Extensive\nexperiments on seven leading LLMs across five datasets validate KIEval's\neffectiveness and generalization. We also reveal that data contamination brings\nno contribution or even negative effect to models' real-world applicability and\nunderstanding, and existing contamination detection methods for LLMs can only\nidentify contamination in pre-training but not during supervised fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "We present Dynamics-Guided Diffusion Model (DGDM), a data-driven framework\nfor generating task-specific manipulator designs without task-specific\ntraining. Given object shapes and task specifications, DGDM generates\nsensor-less manipulator designs that can blindly manipulate objects towards\ndesired motions and poses using an open-loop parallel motion. This framework 1)\nflexibly represents manipulation tasks as interaction profiles, 2) represents\nthe design space using a geometric diffusion model, and 3) efficiently searches\nthis design space using the gradients provided by a dynamics network trained\nwithout any task information. We evaluate DGDM on various manipulation tasks\nranging from shifting/rotating objects to converging objects to a specific\npose. Our generated designs outperform optimization-based and unguided\ndiffusion baselines relatively by 31.5% and 45.3% on average success rate. With\nthe ability to generate a new design within 0.8s, DGDM facilitates rapid design\niteration and enhances the adoption of data-driven approaches for robot\nmechanism design. Qualitative results are best viewed on our project website\nhttps://dgdm-robot.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Verifying a question's validity before answering is crucial in real-world\napplications, where users may provide imperfect instructions. In this scenario,\nan ideal model should address the discrepancies in the query and convey them to\nthe users rather than generating the best possible answer. Addressing this\nrequirement, we introduce a new compositional visual question-answering\ndataset, VISREAS, that consists of answerable and unanswerable visual queries\nformulated by traversing and perturbing commonalities and differences among\nobjects, attributes, and relations. VISREAS contains 2.07M semantically diverse\nqueries generated automatically using Visual Genome scene graphs. The unique\nfeature of this task, validating question answerability with respect to an\nimage before answering, and the poor performance of state-of-the-art models\ninspired the design of a new modular baseline, LOGIC2VISION that reasons by\nproducing and executing pseudocode without any external modules to generate the\nanswer. LOGIC2VISION outperforms generative models in VISREAS (+4.82% over\nLLaVA-1.5; +12.23% over InstructBLIP) and achieves a significant gain in\nperformance against the classification models.",

Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with\nseparate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a\nlatent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts,\nclassification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data\ngeneration by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types,\nquantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset\nand the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and\ndiverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell\ninstance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented\ncell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the\npotential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.",

To overcome these limitations we introduce two\nnovel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the\npolicy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural\nImportance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and\nachieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization.\nNumerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased\nsampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion\nmodels to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and\nfind that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches.

We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM\nassistants despite existing control measures. These include cases where AIs\nvalue themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals. To\nconstrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control.\nAs a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces\npolitical biases and generalizes to new scenarios.

      "abstract": "Does the intrinsic curvature of complex networks hold the key to unveiling\ngraph anomalies that conventional approaches overlook? Reconstruction-based\ngraph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers,\nfocusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we\npropose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the\nnotion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel\npipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant\ngeometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge\ncurvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian\nkernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute\nreconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from\ngeometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete\nOllivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies. By\nleveraging curvature, CurvGAD refines the existing anomaly classifications and\nidentifies new curvature-driven anomalies. Extensive experimentation over 10\nreal-world datasets (both homophilic and heterophilic) demonstrates an\nimprovement of up to 6.5% over state-of-the-art GAD methods.",

      "abstract": "We analyze the performance of heterogeneous learning agents in asset markets\nwith stochastic payoffs. Our agents aim to maximize the expected growth rate of\ntheir wealth but have different theories on how to learn this best. We focus on\ncomparing Bayesian and no-regret learners in market dynamics. Bayesian learners\nwith a prior over a finite set of models that assign positive prior probability\nto the correct model have posterior probabilities that converge exponentially\nto the correct model. Consequently, they survive even in the presence of agents\nwho invest according to the correct model of the stochastic process. Bayesians\nwith a continuum prior converge to the correct model at a rate of $O((\\log\nT)/T)$. Online learning theory provides no-regret algorithms for maximizing the\nlog of wealth in this setting, achieving a worst-case regret bound of $O(\\log\nT)$ without assuming a steady underlying stochastic process but comparing to\nthe best fixed investment rule. This regret, as we observe, is of the same\norder of magnitude as that of a Bayesian learner with a continuum prior.\nHowever, we show that even such low regret may not be sufficient for survival\nin asset markets: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\\log T)$, but still\nvanish in market dynamics when competing against agents who invest according to\nthe correct model or even against a perfect Bayesian with a finite prior. On\nthe other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret\nlearning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more\nrobust. Any no-regret learner will drive out of the market an imperfect\nBayesian whose finite prior or update rule has even small errors. We formally\nestablish the relationship between notions of survival, vanishing, and market\ndomination studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus\nbridging these theories.",

      "abstract": "In the last years, Federated learning (FL) has become a popular solution to\ntrain machine learning models in domains with high privacy concerns. However,\nFL scalability and performance face significant challenges in real-world\ndeployments where data across devices are non-independently and identically\ndistributed (non-IID). The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises\nfrom spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in\nthe absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on\ncentralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure\nrisks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close\nthis gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach\nleveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations\nthrough: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to\nmitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing,\nhierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover,\nFBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the\ndevelopment of more specialized models tailored to the specific data\ndistribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it\nextensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We\ndemonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs\ncomparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging\nnon-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other\nstate-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been\nspecifically designed to address non-IID data distributions.

In this work, we examine whether LLMs can\nlearn from mistakes in mathematical reasoning tasks when these explanations are\nnot provided. We investigate if LLMs are able to implicitly infer such\nrationales simply from observing both incorrect and correct answers.\nSurprisingly, we find that LLMs perform better, on average, when rationales are\neliminated from the context and incorrect answers are simply shown alongside\ncorrect ones. This approach also substantially outperforms chain-of-thought\nprompting in our evaluations. We show that these results are consistent across\nLLMs of different sizes and varying reasoning abilities. Further, we carry out\nan in-depth analysis, and show that prompting with both wrong and correct\nanswers leads to greater performance and better generalisation than introducing\nadditional, more diverse question-answer pairs into the context. Finally, we\nshow that new rationales generated by models that have only observed incorrect\nand correct answers are scored equally as highly by humans as those produced\nwith the aid of exemplar rationales.

A major bottleneck in effectively\nconducting multi-institutional EHR studies is the data heterogeneity across\nsystems with numerous codes that either do not exist or represent different\nclinical concepts across institutions. The need for data privacy further limits\nthe feasibility of including multi-institutional patient-level data required to\nstudy similarities and differences across patient subgroups. To address these\nchallenges, we developed the GAME algorithm. Tested and validated across 7\ninstitutions and 2 languages, GAME integrates data in several levels: (1) at\nthe institutional level with knowledge graphs to establish relationships\nbetween codes and existing knowledge sources, providing the medical context for\nstandard codes and their relationship to each other; (2) between institutions,\nleveraging language models to determine the relationships between\ninstitution-specific codes with established standard codes; and (3) quantifying\nthe strength of the relationships between codes using a graph attention\nnetwork. Jointly trained embeddings are created using transfer and federated\nlearning to preserve data privacy. In this study, we demonstrate the\napplicability of GAME in selecting relevant features as inputs for AI-driven\nalgorithms in a range of conditions, e.g., heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis.\nWe then highlight the application of GAME harmonized multi-institutional EHR\ndata in a study of Alzheimer's disease outcomes and suicide risk among patients\nwith mental health disorders, without sharing patient-level data outside\nindividual institutions.",

      "abstract": "Understanding human behavior and society is a central focus in social\nsciences, with the rise of generative social science marking a significant\nparadigmatic shift. By leveraging bottom-up simulations, it replaces costly and\nlogistically challenging traditional experiments with scalable, replicable, and\nsystematic computational approaches for studying complex social dynamics.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further transformed this\nresearch paradigm, enabling the creation of human-like generative social agents\nand realistic simulacra of society. In this paper, we propose AgentSociety, a\nlarge-scale social simulator that integrates LLM-driven agents, a realistic\nsocietal environment, and a powerful large-scale simulation engine. Based on\nthe proposed simulator, we generate social lives for over 10k agents,\nsimulating their 5 million interactions both among agents and between agents\nand their environment. Furthermore, we explore the potential of AgentSociety as\na testbed for computational social experiments, focusing on four key social\nissues: polarization, the spread of inflammatory messages, the effects of\nuniversal basic income policies, and the impact of external shocks such as\nhurricanes. These four issues serve as valuable cases for assessing\nAgentSociety's support for typical research methods -- such as surveys,\ninterviews, and interventions -- as well as for investigating the patterns,\ncauses, and underlying mechanisms of social issues. The alignment between\nAgentSociety's outcomes and real-world experimental results not only\ndemonstrates its ability to capture human behaviors and their underlying\nmechanisms, but also underscores its potential as an important platform for\nsocial scientists and policymakers.",

However, generating long and\ncorrect CoT trajectories is challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated that\nLooped Transformers possess remarkable length generalization capabilities, but\ntheir limited generality and adaptability prevent them from serving as an\nalternative to auto-regressive solutions. To better leverage the strengths of\nLooped Transformers, we propose RELAY (REasoning through Loop Alignment\niterativelY). Specifically, we align the steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning with loop iterations and apply intermediate supervision during the\ntraining of Looped Transformers. This additional iteration-wise supervision not\nonly preserves the Looped Transformer's ability for length generalization but\nalso enables it to predict CoT reasoning steps for unseen data. Therefore, we\nleverage this Looped Transformer to generate accurate reasoning chains for\ncomplex problems that exceed the training length, which will then be used to\nfine-tune an auto-regressive model. We conduct extensive experiments, and the\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant\nimprovements in the performance of the auto-regressive model.

However, the limited labeled multimodal data\noften hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data\nsynthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a\ncritical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality\nsynthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data\ncovers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream\nscenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities\nsemantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data\nmaintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these\nprinciples, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks,\nmodality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking\nprocess within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3)\nincorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring\nfidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality\nsynthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model\nmmE5.

Unlike denoising modules that rely on multiple iterative\nsteps, text encoders require only a single forward pass to produce text\nembeddings. However, despite their minimal contribution to total inference time\nand floating-point operations (FLOPs), text encoders demand significantly\nhigher memory usage, up to eight times more than denoising modules. To address\nthis inefficiency, we propose Skip and Re-use layers (Skrr), a simple yet\neffective pruning strategy specifically designed for text encoders in T2I\ndiffusion models. Skrr exploits the inherent redundancy in transformer blocks\nby selectively skipping or reusing certain layers in a manner tailored for T2I\ntasks, thereby reducing memory consumption without compromising performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Skrr maintains image quality comparable\nto the original model even under high sparsity levels, outperforming existing\nblockwise pruning methods.

Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have\nshown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal.\nHowever, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems:\n(1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is\nsignificantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and\nocclusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack\ncrucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary\nfor fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks.

      "abstract": "Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a\nfundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning,\nexisting models fail to generalize across different market conditions and\nassets. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we\nshow that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of\ncomplex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we\npropose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to\ncapture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to\nadaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective\nfor longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also\nintroduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the\nhorizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons, using the\nestablished FI-2010 benchmark, a NASDAQ and a Bitcoin dataset. TLOB outperforms\nSoTA methods in every dataset and horizon. Additionally, we empirically show\nhow stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score,\nhighlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered\nin relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using\nan average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting\nperformance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend\nclassification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work\nprovides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend\nprediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial\nAI. We release the code at https://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.",

However, during the global partition\nphase, misclusterings within subgraphs have a tendency to progressively\ncompound throughout the multi-step decoding process of the learning-based\npartition policy. This suboptimal behavior in the global partition phase, in\nturn, may lead to a dramatic deterioration in the performance of the overall\ndecomposition-based system, despite using optimal local constructions. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a versatile Hierarchical Learning-based\nGraph Partition (HLGP) framework, which is tailored to benefit the partition of\nCVRP instances by synergistically integrating global and local partition\npolicies. Specifically, the global partition policy is tasked with creating the\ncoarse multi-way partition to generate the sequence of simpler two-way\npartition subtasks. These subtasks mark the initiation of the subsequent K\nlocal partition levels. At each local partition level, subtasks exclusive for\nthis level are assigned to the local partition policy which benefits from the\ninsensitive local topological features to incrementally alleviate the\ncompounded errors. This framework is versatile in the sense that it optimizes\nthe involved partition policies towards a unified objective harmoniously\ncompatible with both reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL).\n(*Due to the notification of arXiv \"The Abstract field cannot be longer than\n1,920 characters\", the appeared Abstract is shortened.

In unseen environments,\ndistracting pixels may lead agents to extract representations containing\ntask-irrelevant information. As a result, agents may deviate from the optimal\nbehaviors learned during training, thereby hindering visual generalization.To\naddress this issue, we propose the Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy\nLearning (SCPL) algorithm, an efficient framework for zero-shot generalization.\nOur approach introduces a novel value consistency module alongside a dynamics\nmodule to effectively capture task-relevant representations. The value\nconsistency module, guided by saliency, ensures the agent focuses on\ntask-relevant pixels in both original and perturbed observations, while the\ndynamics module uses augmented data to help the encoder capture dynamic- and\nreward-relevant representations. Additionally, our theoretical analysis\nhighlights the importance of policy consistency for generalization.

For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text\nto produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark,\nwhich could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM.\nThis situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and\nhighlights the significance of achieving modification detection and\ngenerated-text detection simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a technique to\ndetect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to\nmodification. We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens\", which\nmeasures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection. When a\nmodification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the\nmodification. Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and\nintroduce a novel method for unbiased watermark. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification\ndetection and generated-text detection by watermark.",

We leverage the\nin-context learning ability of LLMs to perform self-repair in the coding\ndomain. The key contribution of our paper is an approach that synthesises and\nselects an ordered set of golden example pairs, or AuPairs, of these initial\nguesses and subsequent fixes for the corresponding problems. Each such AuPair\nis provided as a single in-context example at inference time to generate a\nrepaired solution. For an inference-time compute budget of $N$ LLM calls per\nproblem, $N$ AuPairs are used to generate $N$ repaired solutions, out of which\nthe highest-scoring solution is selected as the final answer. The underlying\nintuition is that if the LLM is given a different example of fixing an\nincorrect guess each time, it can subsequently generate a diverse set of\nrepaired solutions. Our algorithm selects these AuPairs in a manner that\nmaximises complementarity and usefulness. We demonstrate the results of our\nalgorithm on 5 LLMs across 7 competitive programming datasets for the code\nrepair task. Our algorithm yields a significant boost in performance compared\nto best-of-$N$ and self-repair, and also exhibits strong generalisation across\ndatasets and models.

Forecasting the probability distribution of multivariate\ntime series is a challenging yet practical task. Although some recent attempts\nhave been made to handle this task, two major challenges persist: 1) some\nexisting generative methods underperform in high-dimensional multivariate time\nseries forecasting, which is hard to scale to higher dimensions; 2) the\ninherent high-dimensional multivariate attributes constrain the forecasting\nlengths of existing generative models. In this paper, we point out that\ndiscrete token representations can model high-dimensional MTS with faster\ninference time, and forecasting the target with long-term trends of itself can\nextend the forecasting length with high accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose\na vector quantized framework called Hierarchical Discrete Transformer (HDT)\nthat models time series into discrete token representations with l2\nnormalization enhanced vector quantized strategy, in which we transform the MTS\nforecasting into discrete tokens generation. To address the limitations of\ngenerative models in long-term forecasting, we propose a hierarchical discrete\nTransformer. This model captures the discrete long-term trend of the target at\nthe low level and leverages this trend as a condition to generate the discrete\nrepresentation of the target at the high level that introduces the features of\nthe target itself to extend the forecasting length in high-dimensional MTS.\nExtensive experiments on five popular MTS datasets verify the effectiveness of\nour proposed method.",

To this end, we systematically evaluate recent embeddings for\nassembly code on five downstream tasks using a corpus of 1.2 million functions\nfrom the Debian distribution. We observe that several embeddings perform\nsimilarly when sufficient labeled data is available, and that differences\nreported in prior work are hardly noticeable. Surprisingly, we find that\nend-to-end learning without pre-training performs best on average, which calls\ninto question the need for specialized embeddings.

Although image segmentation has\nrecently been introduced to distinguish particles at the pixel level, the low\nSNR complicates the automated generation of accurate annotations for training\nsupervised models. Moreover, platforms for systematically comparing different\ndesign choices in pipeline construction are lacking. Thus, a modular framework\nis essential to understand the advantages and limitations of this approach and\ndrive further development. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline\nthat automatically generates high-quality segmentation maps from cryo-EM data\nto serve as ground truth labels. Our modular framework enables the selection of\nvarious segmentation models and loss functions. We also integrate Conditional\nRandom Fields (CRFs) with different solvers and feature sets to refine coarse\npredictions, thereby producing fine-grained segmentation. This flexibility\nfacilitates optimal configurations tailored to cryo-EM datasets.

      "abstract": "Estimating individualised treatment effect (ITE) -- that is the causal effect\nof a set of variables (also called exposures, treatments, actions, policies, or\ninterventions), referred to as \\textit{composite treatments}, on a set of\noutcome variables of interest, referred to as \\textit{composite outcomes}, for\na unit from observational data -- remains a fundamental problem in causal\ninference with applications across disciplines, such as healthcare, economics,\neducation, social science, marketing, and computer science. Previous work in\ncausal machine learning for ITE estimation is limited to simple settings, like\nsingle treatments and single outcomes. This hinders their use in complex\nreal-world scenarios; for example, consider studying the effect of different\nICU interventions, such as beta-blockers and statins for a patient admitted for\nheart surgery, on different outcomes of interest such as atrial fibrillation\nand in-hospital mortality. The limited research into composite treatments and\noutcomes is primarily due to data scarcity for all treatments and outcomes. To\naddress the above challenges, we propose a novel and innovative\nhypernetwork-based approach, called \\emph{H-Learner}, to solve ITE estimation\nunder composite treatments and composite outcomes, which tackles the data\nscarcity issue by dynamically sharing information across treatments and\noutcomes. Our empirical analysis with binary and arbitrary composite treatments\nand outcomes demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared\nto existing methods.",

      "abstract": "Hate speech detection is a crucial task, especially on social media, where\nharmful content can spread quickly. Implementing machine learning models to\nautomatically identify and address hate speech is essential for mitigating its\nimpact and preventing its proliferation. The first step in developing an\neffective hate speech detection model is to acquire a high-quality dataset for\ntraining. Labeled data is foundational for most natural language processing\ntasks, but categorizing hate speech is difficult due to the diverse and often\nsubjective nature of hate speech, which can lead to varying interpretations and\ndisagreements among annotators. This paper examines strategies for addressing\nannotator disagreement, an issue that has been largely overlooked. In\nparticular, we evaluate different approaches to deal with annotator\ndisagreement regarding hate speech classification in Turkish tweets, based on a\nfine-tuned BERT model. Our work highlights the importance of the problem and\nprovides state-of-art benchmark results for detection and understanding of hate\nspeech in online discourse.",

We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and\nbenchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline\napproaches.

      "abstract": "We consider what we call the offline-to-online learning setting, focusing on\nstochastic finite-armed bandit problems. In offline-to-online learning, a\nlearner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown\nenvironment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data,\nthe learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its\ninitial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The\nlearner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed\nfor only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the\nLower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can\neffectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently \"covered\" by the\noffline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time,\nUCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly\nthe best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning,\nhowever, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term\nperformance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how\nlong its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and\ngradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This\narticle explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result\nshows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and\nUCB at any point in time. The core idea behind our algorithm is broadly\napplicable, and we anticipate that our results will extend beyond the\nmulti-armed bandit setting.",

      "abstract": "As AI systems become more prevalent, concerns about their development,\noperation, and societal impact intensify. Establishing ethical, social, and\nsafety standards amidst evolving AI capabilities poses significant challenges.\nGlobal initiatives are underway to establish guidelines for AI system\ndevelopment and operation. With the increasing use of collaborative human-AI\ntask execution, it's vital to continuously adapt AI systems to meet user and\nenvironmental needs. Failure to synchronize AI evolution with changes in users\nand the environment could result in ethical and safety issues. This paper\nevaluates the applicability of existing guidelines in human-robot collaborative\nsystems, assesses their effectiveness, and discusses limitations. Through a\ncase study, we examine whether our target system meets requirements outlined in\nexisting guidelines and propose improvements to enhance human-robot\ninteractions. Our contributions provide insights into interpreting and applying\nguidelines, offer concrete examples of system enhancement, and highlight their\napplicability and limitations.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the\ndevelopment of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various\nparadigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle\nwith cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on\ndataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ\nSet-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires\nmetadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across\nplatforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks\nrather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework\nthat enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior\nworks that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI\nelements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL\nseamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen\nParsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module,\nwhich work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and\nsemantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate\nTRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot,\nVisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring,\nTRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new\nstandard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.",

      "abstract": "Wireless sensing is of great benefits to our daily lives. However, wireless\nsignals are sensitive to the surroundings. Various factors, e.g. environments,\nlocations, and individuals, may induce extra impact on wireless propagation.\nSuch a change can be regarded as a domain, in which the data distribution\nshifts. A vast majority of the sensing schemes are learning-based. They are\ndependent on the training domains, resulting in performance degradation in\nunseen domains. Researchers have proposed various solutions to address this\nissue. But these solutions leverage either semi-supervised or unsupervised\ndomain adaptation techniques. They still require some data in the target\ndomains and do not perform well in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a\ndomain generalization framework DGSense, to eliminate the domain dependence\nproblem in wireless sensing. The framework is a general solution working across\ndiverse sensing tasks and wireless technologies. Once the sensing model is\nbuilt, it can generalize to unseen domains without any data from the target\ndomain. To achieve the goal, we first increase the diversity of the training\nset by a virtual data generator, and then extract the domain independent\nfeatures via episodic training between the main feature extractor and the\ndomain feature extractors. The feature extractors employ a pre-trained Residual\nNetwork (ResNet) with an attention mechanism for spatial features, and a 1D\nConvolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) for temporal features. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generality of DGSense, we evaluated on WiFi gesture\nrecognition, Millimeter Wave (mmWave) activity recognition, and acoustic fall\ndetection. All the systems exhibited high generalization capability to unseen\ndomains, including new users, locations, and environments, free of new data and\nretraining.",

We propose a pipeline for identifying\nabstractions for event generalizations from \\texttt{GLUCOSE}\n\\citep{mostafazadeh-etal-2020-glucose}, a large-scale dataset of implicit\ncommonsense causal knowledge, from which we subsequently extract $1,4$K causal\npairs. Our experiments highlight the ongoing challenges of using statistical\nmethods and/or LLMs for automatic abstraction identification and causal\ndiscovery in NLP. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the abstract causal\nknowledge provided in \\texttt{ACCESS} can be leveraged for enhancing QA\nreasoning performance in LLMs.",

Existing multimodal diffusion finetuning methods largely focus on\npixel-level reconstruction rather than in-context reasoning, and are\nconstrained by the complexity and limited availability of reasoning-based\ndatasets. ThinkDiff addresses these challenges by leveraging vision-language\ntraining as a proxy task, aligning VLMs with the decoder of an encoder-decoder\nlarge language model (LLM) instead of a diffusion decoder. This proxy task\nbuilds on the observation that the $\\textbf{LLM decoder}$ shares the same input\nfeature space with $\\textbf{diffusion decoders}$ that use the corresponding\n$\\textbf{LLM encoder}$ for prompt embedding. As a result, aligning VLMs with\ndiffusion decoders can be simplified through alignment with the LLM decoder.\nWithout complex training and datasets, ThinkDiff effectively unleashes\nunderstanding, reasoning, and composing capabilities in diffusion models.\nExperiments demonstrate that ThinkDiff significantly improves accuracy from\n19.2% to 46.3% on the challenging CoBSAT benchmark for multimodal in-context\nreasoning generation, with only 5 hours of training on 4 A100 GPUs.\nAdditionally, ThinkDiff demonstrates exceptional performance in composing\nmultiple images and texts into logically coherent images.

      "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). However, its vast potential remains largely\nunexplored for graphs. This raises an interesting question: How can we design\nCoT prompting for graphs to guide graph models to learn step by step? On one\nhand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by\ncomplex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual\ndata, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this\nwork, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs,\nGCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream\ntask into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of\nprompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt\nlearning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism\ndiffers significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a\nprompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based\ninference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a\n``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step.\nConditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on\nthe current state. These prompts are fed into the next inference step,\nrepeating the cycle. To evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of GCoT, we\nconduct comprehensive experiments on eight public datasets, which demonstrate\nthe advantage of our approach.",

We propose AdaSeek, an adaptive hierarchical search\nalgorithm for autotuning gen-AI workflows. AdaSeek organizes workflow tuning\nmethods into different layers based on the user-specified total search budget\nand distributes the budget across different layers based on the complexity of\neach layer. During its hierarchical search, AdaSeek redistributes the search\nbudget from less useful to more promising tuning configurations based on\nworkflow-level evaluation results. We implement AdaSeek in a workflow\nautotuning framework called Cognify and evaluate Cognify using six types of\nworkflows such as RAG-based QA and text-to-SQL transformation.

      "abstract": "Attribution tags form the foundation of modern cryptoasset forensics.\nHowever, inconsistent or incorrect tags can mislead investigations and even\nresult in false accusations. To address this issue, we propose a novel\ncomputational method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to link attribution\ntags with well-defined knowledge graph concepts. We implemented this method in\nan end-to-end pipeline and conducted experiments showing that our approach\noutperforms baseline methods by up to 37.4% in F1-score across three publicly\navailable attribution tag datasets. By integrating concept filtering and\nblocking procedures, we generate candidate sets containing five knowledge graph\nentities, achieving a recall of 93% without the need for labeled data.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that local LLM models can achieve F1-scores of\n90%, comparable to remote models which achieve 94%. We also analyze the\ncost-performance trade-offs of various LLMs and prompt templates, showing that\nselecting the most cost-effective configuration can reduce costs by 90%, with\nonly a 1% decrease in performance. Our method not only enhances attribution tag\nquality but also serves as a blueprint for fostering more reliable forensic\nevidence.",
      "tldr_zh": "本研究提出了一种基于Large Language Models (LLMs)的计算方法，用于将加密资产归因标签(attribution tags)链接到知识图谱(knowledge graph)实体，以解决标签不一致导致的取证误导问题。该方法通过端到端管道(end-to-end pipeline)整合概念过滤和阻塞程序，生成包含五种知识图谱实体的候选集，实现93%的召回率，且无需标注数据。实验结果显示，该方法在三个公开数据集上比基线方法提高高达37.4%的F1-score，本地LLM模型可达90%的F1-score，与远程模型的94%相当。此外，通过优化LLMs和提示模板的成本-性能权衡，最经济配置可降低成本90%，仅损失1%的性能，从而提升归因标签质量并为可靠取证证据提供蓝图。",

      "abstract": "Current GUI agents have achieved outstanding performance in GUI element\ngrounding. However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to\nsensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight\ndifferences in the initial state-such as the target software not being open or\nthe interface not being in its default state-often lead to planning errors.\nThis issue is widespread in real user scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail\nto evaluate it. In this paper, we present WorldGUI, a novel GUI benchmark that\ndesigns GUI tasks with various initial states to simulate real computer-user\ninteractions. The benchmark spans a wide range of tasks across 10 popular\nsoftware applications, including PowerPoint, VSCode, and Adobe Acrobat. In\naddition, to address the challenges of dynamic GUI automation tasks, we propose\nGUI-Thinker, a holistic framework, leveraging a critique mechanism, that\neffectively manages the unpredictability and complexity of GUI interactions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GUI-Thinker significantly outperforms\nClaude-3.5 (Computer Use) by 14.9% in success rate on WorldGUI tasks. This\nimprovement underscores the effectiveness of our critical-thinking-based\nframework in enhancing GUI automation. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/showlab/WorldGUI.",

Additionally, we show that even minor changes, such as reordering\nsurvey choices, lead to inconsistent outputs, exposing the limitations of\nclosed-style evaluations.

      "abstract": "Humans have long relied on visual aids like sketches and diagrams to support\nreasoning and problem-solving. Visual tools, like auxiliary lines in geometry\nor graphs in calculus, are essential for understanding complex ideas. However,\nmany tutoring systems remain text-based, providing feedback only through\nnatural language. Leveraging recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs),\nthis paper introduces Interactive Sketchpad, a tutoring system that combines\nlanguage-based explanations with interactive visualizations to enhance\nlearning. Built on a pre-trained LMM, Interactive Sketchpad is fine-tuned to\nprovide step-by-step guidance in both text and visuals, enabling natural\nmultimodal interaction with the student. Accurate and robust diagrams are\ngenerated by incorporating code execution into the reasoning process. User\nstudies conducted on math problems such as geometry, calculus, and trigonometry\ndemonstrate that Interactive Sketchpad leads to improved task comprehension,\nproblem-solving accuracy, and engagement levels, highlighting its potential for\ntransforming educational technologies.

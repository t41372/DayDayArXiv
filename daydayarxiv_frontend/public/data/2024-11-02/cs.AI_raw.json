Recent advances with foundational models\nsuggest that text and image data contain such hidden structures, which help\nmitigate the curse of dimensionality. Inspired by results from nonparametric\nstatistics, we hypothesize that this phenomenon can be partially explained in\nterms of decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks. In this paper,\nwe present a controlled experimental framework to test whether neural networks\ncan indeed exploit such \"hidden factorial structures\".

Conditioning the mask generator\non ventricular volume in combination with classifier-free guidance enabled the\ncontrol of the ventricular volume distribution of the generated synthetic\nimages.

The model trained on real\ndata showed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.09 \\pm 12.18 mL in predicted\nventricular volume, while the models trained on synthetic and augmented data\nshowed MAEs of 7.52 \\pm 4.81 mL and 6.23 \\pm 4.33 mL, respectively.

The model trained on augmented data showed the highest Dice score of\n0.892 \\pm 0.05, slightly outperforming SynthSeg and on par with the model\ntrained on real data.

According to the mechanistic approach,\nexplaining opaque AI systems involves identifying the mechanisms underlying\ndecision-making processes.

The goal of this\nproblem is to find a set of fairness-aware invariant parameters of classifier\nthat is trained using data drawn from a family of related training domains with\ndistribution shift on non-sensitive features as well as different levels of\ndependence between model predictions and sensitive features so that the\nclassifier can achieve good generalization performance on unknown but distinct\ntest domains.

This\ndisentanglement facilitates the robust generalization of machine learning\nmodels across diverse domains while adhering to fairness constraints.

    "abstract": "This paper develops theory and algorithms for interacting large language\nmodel agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and\nmicroeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to\ndecision-making by interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian\nsentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and\nstochastic control algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform\nBayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from prior decisions and\nexternal inputs, they exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing\ninterpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to\nunderstand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results.\nFirst, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an\nindividual LLMA satisfies the sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive\n(bounded rationality) utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA\nchooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize\nBayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that\ninteract sequentially with each other and the environment while performing\nBayesian inference. Our models capture the herding behavior exhibited by\ninteracting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay\nherding and improve state estimation accuracy under two settings: (a) centrally\ncontrolled LLMAs and (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. Throughout the\npaper, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on real datasets for hate\nspeech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models\nlike Mistral and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this\npaper, based on substantial empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is\nthat LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social\nlearning when interacting.",

These\ndomains typically require an extensive amount of data for optimal performance,\npotentially utilizing huge centralized data repositories. However, such\ncentralization could raise privacy issues concerning the storage of sensitive\ndata. To address this issue, federated learning was developed. It is a newly\ndistributed learning technique that enables to collaboratively train a deep\nlearning model on decentralized devices, referred to as clients, without\ncompromising their data privacy. Traditional federated learning methods often\nsuffer from severe performance degradation when the data distribution among\nclients differs significantly. This becomes especially problematic in the case\nof label distribution skew, where the distribution of labels varies across\nclients. To address this, a novel method called FedEntOpt is proposed.\nFedEntOpt is designed to mitigate performance issues caused by label\ndistribution skew by maximizing the entropy of the global label distribution of\nthe selected client subset in each federated learning round. This ensures that\nthe aggregated model parameters from the clients were exhibited to data from\nall available labels, which improves the accuracy of the global model.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 6\\% in\nclassification accuracy under standard settings regardless of the model size.\nMoreover, it exhibits robust and superior performance in scenarios with low\nparticipation rates and client dropout, achieving increases in classification\naccuracy of over 30\\%. In addition, FedEntOpt offers the flexibility to be\ncombined with existing algorithms, enhancing their performance by over 40\\%.",

    "abstract": "Feature Selection techniques aim at finding a relevant subset of features\nthat perform equally or better than the original set of features at explaining\nthe behavior of data. Typically, features are extracted from feature ranking or\nsubset selection techniques, and the performance is measured by classification\nor regression tasks. However, while selected features may not have equal\nimportance for the task, they do have equal importance for each class. This\nwork first introduces a comprehensive review of the concept of class-specific,\nwith a focus on feature selection and classification. The fundamental idea of\nthe class-specific concept resides in the understanding that the significance\nof each feature can vary from one class to another. This contrasts with the\ntraditional class-independent approach, which evaluates the importance of\nattributes collectively for all classes. For example, in tumor prediction\nscenarios, each type of tumor may be associated with a distinct subset of\nrelevant features. These features possess significant discriminatory power,\nenabling the differentiation of one tumor type from others. This class-specific\nperspective offers a more effective approach to classification tasks by\nrecognizing and leveraging the unique characteristics of each class. Secondly,\nclassification schemes from one-versus-all and one-versus-each strategies are\ndescribed, and a novel deep one-versus-each strategy is introduced, which\noffers advantages from the point of view of explainability (feature selection)\nand decomposability (classification). Thirdly, a novel class-specific relevance\nmatrix is presented, from which some more sophisticated classification schemes\ncan be derived, such as the three-layer class-specific scheme. The potential\nfor further advancements is wide and will open new horizons for exploring novel\nresearch directions in multiclass hyperdimensional contexts.",

This paper presents the Explainable Class-Specific Naive\nBayes (XNB) classifier, which introduces two critical innovations: 1) the use\nof Kernel Density Estimation to calculate posterior probabilities, allowing for\na more accurate and flexible estimation process, and 2) the selection of\nclass-specific feature subsets, ensuring that only the most relevant variables\nfor each class are utilized. Extensive empirical analysis on high-dimensional\ngenomic datasets shows that XNB matches the classification performance of\ntraditional Naive Bayes while drastically improving model interpretability. By\nisolating the most relevant features for each class, XNB not only reduces the\nfeature set to a minimal, distinct subset for each class but also provides\ndeeper insights into how the model makes predictions. This approach offers\nsignificant advantages in fields where both precision and explainability are\ncritical.",

However, most current MAHRL algorithms follow the\ntraditional way of using reward functions in reinforcement learning, which\nlimits their use to a single task. This study aims to design a multi-agent\ncooperative algorithm with logic reward shaping (LRS), which uses a more\nflexible way of setting the rewards, allowing for the effective completion of\nmulti-tasks. LRS uses Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to express the internal logic\nrelation of subtasks within a complex task. Then, it evaluates whether the\nsubformulae of the LTL expressions are satisfied based on a designed reward\nstructure. This helps agents to learn to effectively complete tasks by adhering\nto the LTL expressions, thus enhancing the interpretability and credibility of\ntheir decisions. To enhance coordination and cooperation among multiple agents,\na value iteration technique is designed to evaluate the actions taken by each\nagent. Based on this evaluation, a reward function is shaped for coordination,\nwhich enables each agent to evaluate its status and complete the remaining\nsubtasks through experiential learning. Experiments have been conducted on\nvarious types of tasks in the Minecraft-like environment. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of\nmulti-agents when learning to complete multi-tasks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) encompasses a suite of tasks whose solving\nrequires the ability to discover common concepts underlying the set of pictures\nthrough an analogy-making process, similarly to human IQ tests. Bongard\nProblems (BPs), proposed in 1968, constitute a fundamental challenge in this\ndomain mainly due to their requirement to combine visual reasoning and verbal\ndescription. This work poses a question whether multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) inherently designed to combine vision and language are capable\nof tackling BPs. To this end, we propose a set of diverse MLLM-suited\nstrategies to tackle BPs and examine four popular proprietary MLLMs: GPT-4o,\nGPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and four open models:\nInternVL2-8B, LLaVa-1.6 Mistral-7B, Phi-3.5-Vision, and Pixtral 12B. The above\nMLLMs are compared on three BP datasets: a set of original BP instances relying\non synthetic, geometry-based images and two recent datasets based on real-world\nimages, i.e., Bongard-HOI and Bongard-OpenWorld. The experiments reveal\nsignificant limitations of MLLMs in solving BPs. In particular, the models\nstruggle to solve the classical set of synthetic BPs, despite their visual\nsimplicity. Though their performance ameliorates on real-world concepts\nexpressed in Bongard-HOI and Bongard-OpenWorld, the models still have\ndifficulty in utilizing new information to improve their predictions, as well\nas utilizing a dialog context window effectively. To capture the reasons of\nperformance discrepancy between synthetic and real-world AVR domains, we\npropose Bongard-RWR, a new BP dataset consisting of real-world images that\ntranslates concepts from hand-crafted synthetic BPs to real-world concepts. The\nMLLMs' results on Bongard-RWR suggest that their poor performance on classical\nBPs is not due to domain specificity but rather reflects their general AVR\nlimitations.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) presents a challenging yet\nrealistic scenario, which requires the model to continually learn new classes\nwith limited labeled data (i.e., incremental sessions) while retaining\nknowledge of previously learned base classes (i.e., base sessions). Due to the\nlimited data in incremental sessions, models are prone to overfitting new\nclasses and suffering catastrophic forgetting of base classes. To tackle these\nissues, recent advancements resort to prototype-based approaches to constrain\nthe base class distribution and learn discriminative representations of new\nclasses. Despite the progress, the limited data issue still induces ill-divided\nfeature space, leading the model to confuse the new class with old classes or\nfail to facilitate good separation among new classes. In this paper, we aim to\nmitigate these issues by directly constraining the span of each class\ndistribution from a covariance perspective. In detail, we propose a simple yet\neffective covariance constraint loss to force the model to learn each class\ndistribution with the same covariance matrix. In addition, we propose a\nperturbation approach to perturb the few-shot training samples in the feature\nspace, which encourages the samples to be away from the weighted distribution\nof other classes. Regarding perturbed samples as new class data, the classifier\nis forced to establish explicit boundaries between each new class and the\nexisting ones. Our approach is easy to integrate into existing FSCIL approaches\nto boost performance. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of\nFSCIL.",

Our study also evaluates how well these\nvision-language models (VLMs) adhere to stylistic instructions, disentangling\nstyle evaluation from embedded-text fidelity. Through human evaluation studies,\nwe quantitatively meta-evaluate the effectiveness of the metric.

This study\ninvestigates the application of industrial digital twins (DTs) in education,\nfocusing on how DT models of varying fidelity can support different stages of\nBloom's taxonomy in the cognitive domain. We align Bloom's six cognitive stages\nwith educational levels: undergraduate studies for \"Remember\" and \"Understand,\"\nmaster's level for \"Apply\" and \"Analyze,\" and doctoral level for \"Evaluate\" and\n\"Create.\" Low-fidelity DTs aid essential knowledge acquisition and skill\ntraining, providing a low-risk environment for grasping fundamental concepts.\nMedium-fidelity DTs offer more detailed and dynamic simulations, enhancing\napplication skills and problem-solving. High-fidelity DTs support advanced\nlearners by replicating physical phenomena, allowing for innovative design and\ncomplex experiments. Within this framework, large language models (LLMs) serve\nas mentors, assessing progress, filling knowledge gaps, and assisting with DT\ninteractions, parameter setting, and debugging. We evaluate the educational\nimpact using the Kirkpatrick Model, examining how each DT model's fidelity\ninfluences learning outcomes. This framework helps educators make informed\ndecisions on integrating DTs and LLMs to meet specific learning objectives.",

Due to the multi-step denoising\ncharacteristic, researchers have recently considered combining score-based\ngenerative models with the gradient boosting algorithm, a multi-step supervised\nlearning algorithm, to solve supervised learning tasks. However, existing\ngenerative model algorithms are often limited by the stochastic nature of the\nmodels and the long inference time, impacting prediction performances.\nTherefore, we propose a Supervised Score-based Model (SSM), which can be viewed\nas a gradient boosting algorithm combining score matching.

    "abstract": "Molecular property prediction (MPP) is integral to drug discovery and\nmaterial science, but often faces the challenge of data scarcity in real-world\nscenarios. Addressing this, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has\nbeen developed. Unlike other few-shot tasks, FSMPP typically employs a\npre-trained molecular encoder and a context-aware classifier, benefiting from\nmolecular pre-training and molecular context information. Despite these\nadvancements, existing methods struggle with the ineffective fine-tuning of\npre-trained encoders. We attribute this issue to the imbalance between the\nabundance of tunable parameters and the scarcity of labeled molecules, and the\nlack of contextual perceptiveness in the encoders. To overcome this hurdle, we\npropose a parameter-efficient in-context tuning method, named Pin-Tuning.\nSpecifically, we propose a lightweight adapter for pre-trained message passing\nlayers (MP-Adapter) and Bayesian weight consolidation for pre-trained atom/bond\nembedding layers (Emb-BWC), to achieve parameter-efficient tuning while\npreventing over-fitting and catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we enhance\nthe MP-Adapters with contextual perceptiveness. This innovation allows for\nin-context tuning of the pre-trained encoder, thereby improving its\nadaptability for specific FSMPP tasks. When evaluated on public datasets, our\nmethod demonstrates superior tuning with fewer trainable parameters, improving\nfew-shot predictive performance.",

Recent advancements approach this through sequence\nmodeling, leveraging the Transformer architecture's scalability and the\nbenefits of parameter sharing to exploit task similarities. However, variations\nin task content and complexity pose significant challenges in policy\nformulation, necessitating judicious parameter sharing and management of\nconflicting gradients for optimal policy performance. Furthermore, identifying\nthe optimal parameter subspace for each task often necessitates prior knowledge\nof the task identifier during inference, limiting applicability in real-world\nscenarios with variable task content and unknown current tasks. In this work,\nwe introduce the Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer (HarmoDT), a novel\nsolution designed to identify an optimal harmony subspace of parameters for\neach task. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem within a\nmeta-learning framework, where the upper level learns masks to define the\nharmony subspace, while the inner level focuses on updating parameters to\nimprove the overall performance of the unified policy. To eliminate the need\nfor task identifiers, we further design a group-wise variant (G-HarmoDT) that\nclusters tasks into coherent groups based on gradient information, and utilizes\na gating network to determine task identifiers during inference. Empirical\nevaluations across various benchmarks highlight the superiority of our\napproach, demonstrating its effectiveness in the multi-task context with\nspecific improvements of 8% gain in task-provided settings, 5% in task-agnostic\nsettings, and 10% in unseen settings.",

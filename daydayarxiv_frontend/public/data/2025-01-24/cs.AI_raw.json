Deep learning\n(DL) has recently emerged as an alternative and blossomed in hydrology\ncommunity for rainfall-runoff simulations. However, the decades-old Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) network remains the benchmark for this task,\noutperforming newer architectures like Transformers. In this work, we propose a\nState Space Model (SSM), specifically the Frequency Tuned Diagonal State Space\nSequence (S4D-FT) model, for rainfall-runoff simulations. The proposed S4D-FT\nis benchmarked against the established LSTM and a physically-based Sacramento\nSoil Moisture Accounting model across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United\nStates (CONUS). Results show that S4D-FT is able to outperform the LSTM model\nacross diverse regions. Our pioneering introduction of the S4D-FT for\nrainfall-runoff simulations challenges the dominance of LSTM in the hydrology\ncommunity and expands the arsenal of DL tools available for hydrological\nmodeling.",

    "abstract": "Power distribution networks are evolving due to the integration of DERs and\nincreased customer participation. To maintain optimal operation, minimize\nlosses, and meet varying load demands, frequent network reconfiguration is\nnecessary. Traditionally, the reconfiguration task relies on optimization\nsoftware and expert operators, but as systems grow more complex, faster and\nmore adaptive solutions are required without expert intervention. Data-driven\nreconfiguration is gaining traction for its accuracy, speed, and robustness\nagainst incomplete network data. LLMs, with their ability to capture complex\npatterns, offer a promising approach for efficient and responsive network\nreconfiguration in evolving complex power networks.\n  In this work, we introduce LLM4DistReconfig, a deep learning-based approach\nutilizing a fine-tuned LLM to solve the distribution network reconfiguration\nproblem. By carefully crafting prompts and designing a custom loss function, we\ntrain the LLM with inputs representing network parameters such as buses,\navailable lines, open lines, node voltages, and system loss. The model then\npredicts optimal reconfigurations by outputting updated network configurations\nthat minimize system loss while meeting operational constraints. Our approach\nsignificantly reduces inference time compared to classical algorithms, allowing\nfor near real-time optimal reconfiguration after training. Experimental results\nshow that our method generates optimal configurations minimizing system loss\nfor five individual and a combined test dataset. It also produces minimal\ninvalid edges, no cycles, or subgraphs across all datasets, fulfilling\ndomain-specific needs. Additionally, the generated responses contain less than\n5% improper outputs on seen networks and satisfactory results on unseen\nnetworks, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability for the\nreconfiguration task.",

Our approach begins with a binarization step for categorical\nfeatures using one-hot encoding, followed by the computation of graph\ncovariance at each time. This graph covariance quantifies temporal changes in\ndependence structures within categorical data and is established as a\nconsistent dependence measure under the Bernoulli distribution.

These extracted feature pairs, along with their timestamps,\nare subsequently passed to an LLM tasked with generating potential explanations\nof the underlying events driving these dependence changes.

    "abstract": "Cardiac anatomy segmentation is essential for clinical assessment of cardiac\nfunction and disease diagnosis to inform treatment and intervention. In\nperforming segmentation, deep learning (DL) algorithms improved accuracy\nsignificantly compared to traditional image processing approaches. More\nrecently, studies showed that enhancing DL segmentation with motion information\ncan further improve it. A range of methods for injecting motion information has\nbeen proposed, but many of them increase the dimensionality of input images\n(which is computationally expensive) or have not used an optimal method to\ninsert motion information, such as non-DL registration, non-attention-based\nnetworks or single-headed attention. Here, we present a novel,\ncomputation-efficient alternative where a novel, scalable temporal attention\nmodule (TAM) extracts temporal feature interactions multiple times and where\nTAM has a multi-headed, KQV projection cross-attention architecture. The module\ncan be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing CNN- or\nTransformer-based networks, providing novel flexibility for inclusion in future\nimplementations. Extensive evaluations on different cardiac datasets, 2D\nechocardiography (CAMUS), and 3D echocardiography (MITEA) demonstrate the\nmodel's effectiveness when integrated into well-established backbone networks\nlike UNet, FCN8s, UNetR, SwinUNetR, and the recent I2UNet. We further find that\nthe optimized TAM-enhanced FCN8s network performs well compared to contemporary\nalternatives. Our results confirm TAM's robustness, scalability, and\ngeneralizability across diverse datasets and backbones.",

In contrast to the ubiquitous Empirical Risk Minimization\n(ERM) framework, which optimizes for average performance, FL demands\nsatisfactory performance on every individual data point. Since any model that\nmeets the prescribed performance threshold is a valid FL solution, the choice\nof optimization algorithm and its dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the\nproperties of the resulting solutions. In particular, we study a primal-dual\napproach which dynamically re-weights the importance of each sample during\ntraining. To address the challenge of setting a meaningful threshold in\npractice, we introduce a relaxation of FL that incorporates slack variables of\nminimal norm. Our empirical analysis, spanning image classification, age\nregression, and preference optimization in large language models, demonstrates\nthat models trained via FL can learn from data while displaying improved tail\nbehavior compared to ERM, with only a marginal impact on average performance.",

    "abstract": "In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine\nand law, it is critical not only to retrieve relevant information but also to\nprovide causal reasoning and explainability. Large language models (LLMs) have\nachieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and\ngeneration tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as\ndifficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and\nexplaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating\nknowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has\nemerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on\nsimple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal\nrelationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This\npaper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to\nemphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's\nchain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path\nimprovements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent\ngains, with up to a 10\\% absolute improvement across multiple large language\nmodels (LLMs).

To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of\nthe Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state\nas a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global\nfeatures, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in\nRL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives:\npolicies that demonstrate resilience to certain types of unexpected dynamic\nnetwork topology changes, reasonable generalisation to networks of varying\nsizes within the same structural distribution, and interpretable defensive\nactions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate that GAT\ndefensive policies can be trained using our low-level directed graph\nobservations, even when unexpected connections arise during simulation.\nEvaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork\nstructure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained\nspecifically for each network configuration.

However, we empirically\nfound that three important factors can substantially impact detection\nperformance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the\ntuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination\nweights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection\nmethods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by\nlabel information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and\ncombination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance,\nusing label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage\nand leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been\ncriticized as \"one of the top ten data mining mistakes\", yet many recent\nstudies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information\nto select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an\ninternal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select\nhyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection.

The reasons for their\nremarkable ability to generalize are not well understood yet. It has also been\nknown that deep networks possess the ability to memorize training data, as\nevidenced by perfect or high training accuracies on models trained with\ncorrupted data that have class labels shuffled to varying degrees.\nConcomitantly, such models are known to generalize poorly, i.e. they suffer\nfrom poor test accuracies, due to which it is thought that the act of\nmemorizing substantially degrades the ability to generalize. It has, however,\nbeen unclear why the poor generalization that accompanies such memorization,\ncomes about. One possibility is that in the process of training with corrupted\ndata, the layers of the network irretrievably reorganize their representations\nin a manner that makes generalization difficult. The other possibility is that\nthe network retains significant ability to generalize, but the trained network\nsomehow chooses to readout in a manner that is detrimental to generalization.\nHere, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating,\nempirically, that such models possess information in their representations for\nsubstantially improved generalization, even in the face of memorization.\nFurthermore, such generalization abilities can be easily decoded from the\ninternals of the trained model, and we build a technique to do so from the\noutputs of specific layers of the network.

    "abstract": "Precise and real-time estimation of the robotic arm's position on the\npatient's side is essential for the success of remote robotic surgery in\nTactile Internet (TI) environments. This paper presents a prediction model\nbased on the Transformer-based Informer framework for accurate and efficient\nposition estimation. Additionally, it combines a Four-State Hidden Markov Model\n(4-State HMM) to simulate realistic packet loss scenarios. The proposed\napproach addresses challenges such as network delays, jitter, and packet loss\nto ensure reliable and precise operation in remote surgical applications. The\nmethod integrates the optimization problem into the Informer model by embedding\nconstraints such as energy efficiency, smoothness, and robustness into its\ntraining process using a differentiable optimization layer. The Informer\nframework uses features such as ProbSparse attention, attention distilling, and\na generative-style decoder to focus on position-critical features while\nmaintaining a low computational complexity of O(L log L). The method is\nevaluated using the JIGSAWS dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 90\npercent under various network scenarios. A comparison with models such as TCN,\nRNN, and LSTM demonstrates the Informer framework's superior performance in\nhandling position prediction and meeting real-time requirements, making it\nsuitable for Tactile Internet-enabled robotic surgery.",

To\naddress this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed\nto assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical\nrecords contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 300 patient-specific\nclinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians,\nrealistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a\nFHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase.

However, existing deductive reasoning\nbenchmarks, which are crucial for evaluating and advancing LLMs, are inadequate\ndue to their lack of task complexity, presence of prior knowledge as a\nconfounder, and superficial error analysis. To address these deficiencies, we\nintroduce JustLogic, a synthetically generated deductive reasoning benchmark\ndesigned for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. JustLogic is (i) highly complex,\ncapable of generating a diverse range of linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and\nargument structures; (ii) prior knowledge independent, eliminating the\nadvantage of models possessing prior knowledge and ensuring that only deductive\nreasoning is used to answer questions; and (iii) capable of in-depth error\nanalysis on the heterogeneous effects of reasoning depth and argument form on\nmodel accuracy. Our experimental results on JustLogic reveal that (i)\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs perform on par or better than the human\naverage but significantly worse than the human ceiling, and (ii) SOTA\nnon-reasoning models still underperform the human average.

In this work, we focus on settings\nwhere the agent's type is drawn from an unknown distribution, and formalize an\noffline learning framework for learning near-optimal contracts from sample\nagent types. A central tool in our analysis is the notion of pseudo-dimension\nfrom statistical learning theory. Beyond its role in establishing upper bounds\non the sample complexity, pseudo-dimension measures the intrinsic complexity of\na class of contracts, offering a new perspective on the tradeoffs between\nsimplicity and optimality in contract design. Our main results provide\nessentially optimal tradeoffs between pseudo-dimension and representation error\n(defined as the loss in principal's utility) with respect to linear and bounded\ncontracts. Using these tradeoffs, we derive sample- and time-efficient learning\nalgorithms, and demonstrate their near-optimality by providing almost matching\nlower bounds on the sample complexity. Conversely, for unbounded contracts, we\nprove an impossibility result showing that no learning algorithm exists.\n  Finally, we extend our techniques in three important ways. First, we provide\nrefined pseudo-dimension and sample complexity guarantees for the combinatorial\nactions model, revealing a novel connection between the number of critical\nvalues and sample complexity. Second, we extend our results to menus of\ncontracts, showing that their pseudo-dimension scales linearly with the menu\nsize. Third, we adapt our algorithms to the online learning setting, where we\nshow that, a polynomial number of type samples suffice to learn near-optimal\nbounded contracts.

    "abstract": "Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy,\nmaking reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their\nwidespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these\npesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning\napplications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or\nregression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular\nstructures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose\nPesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders,\ndesigned to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first\ntime. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an\ninitial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure\nrepresentation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates\ntoxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple\ntoxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to\ngenerate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen\nachieves approximately 68\\% structural validity in generating new molecular\nstructures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and\nfeasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more\nsustainable pest management solutions.",

    "abstract": "Dense retrievers have demonstrated significant potential for neural\ninformation retrieval; however, they exhibit a lack of robustness to domain\nshifts, thereby limiting their efficacy in zero-shot settings across diverse\ndomains. Previous research has investigated unsupervised domain adaptation\ntechniques to adapt dense retrievers to target domains. However, these studies\nhave not focused on explainability analysis to understand how such adaptations\nalter the model's behavior. In this paper, we propose utilizing the integrated\ngradients framework to develop an interpretability method that provides both\ninstance-based and ranking-based explanations for dense retrievers. To generate\nthese explanations, we introduce a novel baseline that reveals both query and\ndocument attributions. This method is used to analyze the effects of domain\nadaptation on input attributions for query and document tokens across two\ndatasets: the financial question answering dataset (FIQA) and the biomedical\ninformation retrieval dataset (TREC-COVID). Our visualizations reveal that\ndomain-adapted models focus more on in-domain terminology compared to\nnon-adapted models, exemplified by terms such as \"hedge,\" \"gold,\" \"corona,\" and\n\"disease.\" This research addresses how unsupervised domain adaptation\ntechniques influence the behavior of dense retrievers when adapted to new\ndomains. Additionally, we demonstrate that integrated gradients are a viable\nchoice for explaining and analyzing the internal mechanisms of these opaque\nneural models.",

We developed a novel lightweight CDCL SAT solver, GipSAT, which\nintegrates these optimizations. A comprehensive evaluation highlights the\nperformance improvements achieved by GipSAT.

Collecting data often involves considerable time and economic\neffort that is unaffordable in most cases. Fortunately, devices like robots can\nbe trained with synthetic experience thanks to virtual environments. With this\napproach, the sample efficiency problems of artificial agents are mitigated,\nbut another issue arises: the need for efficiently transferring the synthetic\nexperience into the real world (sim-to-real).\n  This paper analyzes the robustness of a state-of-the-art sim-to-real\ntechnique known as progressive neural networks (PNNs) and studies how adding\ndiversity to the synthetic experience can complement it. To better understand\nthe drivers that lead to a lack of robustness, the robotic agent is still\ntested in a virtual environment to ensure total control on the divergence\nbetween the simulated and real models.\n  The results show that a PNN-like agent exhibits a substantial decrease in its\nrobustness at the beginning of the real training phase. Randomizing certain\nvariables during simulation-based training significantly mitigates this issue.\nOn average, the increase in the model's accuracy is around 25% when diversity\nis introduced in the training process.

Federated\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution\nto address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs\non resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key\nlimitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices leads to significant\nperformance degradation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in\ncommunication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a\nnovel Adaptive Rank Allocation framework for federated parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated Singular\nValue Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance similar feature representation\nacross clients, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data\nheterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to\nprogressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication\nefficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to automatically\nremove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational cost and memory\nusage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA\nconsistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to 8.49% across\nvarious datasets and models under heterogeneous data while significantly\nimproving communication efficiency by 2.40$ \\times$.

To address this, we propose Semantic Keypoint Imitation\nLearning (SKIL), a framework which automatically obtain semantic keypoints with\nhelp of vision foundation models, and forms the descriptor of semantic\nkeypoints that enables effecient imitation learning of complex robotic tasks\nwith significantly lower sample complexity. In real world experiments, SKIL\ndoubles the performance of baseline methods in tasks such as picking a cup or\nmouse, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to variations in objects,\nenvironmental changes, and distractors. For long-horizon tasks like hanging a\ntowel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean\nsuccess rate of 70\\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL\nnaturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints\nabstraction, our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring\nconsiderable improvement to the learning performance.

    "abstract": "Detecting biases in the outputs produced by generative models is essential to\nreduce the potential risks associated with their application in critical\nsettings. However, the majority of existing methodologies for identifying\nbiases in generated text consider the models in isolation and neglect their\ncontextual applications. Specifically, the biases that may arise in multi-agent\nsystems involving generative models remain under-researched. To address this\ngap, we present a framework designed to quantify biases within multi-agent\nsystems of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach involves\nsimulating small echo chambers, where pairs of LLMs, initialized with aligned\nperspectives on a polarizing topic, engage in discussions. Contrary to\nexpectations, we observe significant shifts in the stance expressed in the\ngenerated messages, particularly within echo chambers where all agents\ninitially express conservative viewpoints, in line with the well-documented\npolitical bias of many LLMs toward liberal positions. Crucially, the bias\nobserved in the echo-chamber experiment remains undetected by current\nstate-of-the-art bias detection methods that rely on questionnaires. This\nhighlights a critical need for the development of a more sophisticated toolkit\nfor bias detection and mitigation for AI multi-agent systems.

To\novercome this problem, we provide a new definition called Relative LRP where\nthe classical conservation law is satisfied up to a multiplicative factor but\nwithout divisions by small values except for Resnet skip connection.

One potential\napplication of these models in the educational field would be to provide\nfeedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a\nstudent struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from\nan LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related\nto such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models,\nGPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The\nempirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T,\nhowever, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to\nthe possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may\nnot always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed\nprompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important\nparts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the\nfraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort.\nThis was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically\nanalyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's\nperformance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a\npossible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs,\nwhich is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques.

Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its\npotential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the\ntrue reward distribution, which leads to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is\neffective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield\nobjective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such\nas question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the\nquestion, which cannot yield an objective reward without the ground truth.\nSecondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically\nrequires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token\nusage and time consumption.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal sequential recommendation (SR) leverages multi-modal data to\nlearn more comprehensive item features and user preferences than traditional SR\nmethods, which has become a critical topic in both academia and industry.\nExisting methods typically focus on enhancing multi-modal information utility\nthrough adaptive modality fusion to capture the evolving of user preference\nfrom user-item interaction sequences. However, most of them overlook the\ninterference caused by redundant interest-irrelevant information contained in\nrich multi-modal data. Additionally, they primarily rely on implicit temporal\ninformation based solely on chronological ordering, neglecting explicit\ntemporal signals that could more effectively represent dynamic user interest\nover time. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical time-aware\nMixture of experts for multi-modal Sequential Recommendation (HM4SR) with a\ntwo-level Mixture of Experts (MoE) and a multi-task learning strategy.\nSpecifically, the first MoE, named Interactive MoE, extracts essential user\ninterest-related information from the multi-modal data of each item. Then, the\nsecond MoE, termed Temporal MoE, captures user dynamic interests by introducing\nexplicit temporal embeddings from timestamps in modality encoding. To further\naddress data sparsity, we propose three auxiliary supervision tasks:\nsequence-level category prediction (CP) for item feature understanding,\ncontrastive learning on ID (IDCL) to align sequence context with user\ninterests, and placeholder contrastive learning (PCL) to integrate temporal\ninformation with modalities for dynamic interest modeling. Extensive\nexperiments on four public datasets verify the effectiveness of HM4SR compared\nto several state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "In reality, users have different interests in different periods, regions,\nscenes, etc. Such changes in interest are so drastic that they are difficult to\nbe captured by recommenders. Existing multi-domain learning can alleviate this\nproblem. However, the structure of the industrial recommendation system is\ncomplex, the amount of data is huge, and the training cost is extremely high,\nso it is difficult to modify the structure of the industrial recommender and\nre-train it. To fill this gap, we consider recommenders as large pre-trained\nmodels and fine-tune them. We first propose the theory of the information\nbottleneck for fine-tuning and present an explanation for the fine-tuning\ntechnique in recommenders. To tailor for recommendation, we design an\ninformation-aware adaptive kernel (IAK) technique to fine-tune the pre-trained\nrecommender. Specifically, we define fine-tuning as two phases: knowledge\ncompression and knowledge matching and let the training stage of IAK explicitly\napproximate these two phases. Our proposed approach designed from the essence\nof fine-tuning is well interpretable. Extensive online and offline experiments\nshow the superiority of our proposed method. Besides, we also share unique and\nimportant lessons we learned when deploying the method in a large-scale online\nplatform. We also present the potential issues of fine-tuning techniques in\nrecommendation systems and the corresponding solutions. The recommender with\nIAK technique has been deployed on the homepage of a billion-scale online food\nplatform for several months and has yielded considerable profits in our\nbusiness.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong multimodal capabilities but\nhave been found to be more susceptible to generating harmful content compared\nto their backbone large language models (LLMs). Our investigation reveals that\nthe integration of images significantly shifts the model's internal activations\nduring the forward pass, diverging from those triggered by textual input.\nMoreover, the safety alignments of LLMs embedded within VLMs are not\nsufficiently robust to handle the activations discrepancies, making the models\nvulnerable to even the simplest jailbreaking attacks. To address this issue, we\npropose an \\textbf{internal activation revision} approach that efficiently\nrevises activations during generation, steering the model toward safer outputs.\nOur framework incorporates revisions at both the layer and head levels,\noffering control over the model's generation at varying levels of granularity.\nIn addition, we explore three strategies for constructing positive and negative\nsamples and two approaches for extracting revision vectors, resulting in\ndifferent variants of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe internal activation revision method significantly improves the safety of\nwidely used VLMs, reducing attack success rates by an average of 48.94\\%,\n34.34\\%, 43.92\\%, and 52.98\\% on SafeBench, Safe-Unsafe, Unsafe, and\nMM-SafetyBench, respectively, while minimally impacting model helpfulness.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications,\nraising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with\njailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus\nprimarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by\nreal-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or\npredefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during\nattacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework\ndesigned to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of\nthree stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback\n(Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\ndirect preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the\nattacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an\nattack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against\nGemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o,\nsignificantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a\n7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that\nleverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing\ndecomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack\ngoals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against\nadvanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, termed\nReward-Guided Conservative Q-learning (RG-CQL), to enhance coordination between\nride-pooling and public transit within a multimodal transportation network. We\nmodel each ride-pooling vehicle as an agent governed by a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) and propose an offline training and online fine-tuning RL\nframework to learn the optimal operational decisions of the multimodal\ntransportation systems, including rider-vehicle matching, selection of drop-off\nlocations for passengers, and vehicle routing decisions, with improved data\nefficiency. During the offline training phase, we develop a Conservative Double\nDeep Q Network (CDDQN) as the action executor and a supervised learning-based\nreward estimator, termed the Guider Network, to extract valuable insights into\naction-reward relationships from data batches. In the online fine-tuning phase,\nthe Guider Network serves as an exploration guide, aiding CDDQN in effectively\nand conservatively exploring unknown state-action pairs. The efficacy of our\nalgorithm is demonstrated through a realistic case study using real-world data\nfrom Manhattan. We show that integrating ride-pooling with public transit\noutperforms two benchmark cases solo rides coordinated with transit and\nride-pooling without transit coordination by 17% and 22% in the achieved system\nrewards, respectively. Furthermore, our innovative offline training and online\nfine-tuning framework offers a remarkable 81.3% improvement in data efficiency\ncompared to traditional online RL methods with adequate exploration budgets,\nwith a 4.3% increase in total rewards and a 5.6% reduction in overestimation\nerrors.

We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving\nVL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic\ndecisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM\nfor coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art\nLLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel\nVL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks.

    "abstract": "Post-training pruning, as one of the key techniques for compressing large\nlanguage models, plays a vital role in lightweight model deployment and model\nsparsity. However, current mainstream pruning methods dependent on the Hessian\nmatrix face significant limitations in both pruning speed and practical\neffectiveness due to the computationally intensive nature of second-order\nderivative calculations. This paper presents SwiftPrune, a novel Hessian-free\nweight pruning method that achieves hardware-efficient model compression\nthrough two key innovations: 1) SwiftPrune eliminates the need for\ncomputationally intensive Hessian matrix calculations by introducing a\ncontribution-based weight metric, which evaluates the importance of weights\nwithout relying on second-order derivatives. 2) we employ the Exponentially\nWeighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique to bypass weight sorting, enabling the\nselection of weights that contribute most to LLM accuracy and further reducing\ntime complexity. Our approach is extended to support structured sparsity\npruning, facilitating efficient execution on modern hardware accelerators. We\nvalidate the SwiftPrune on three LLMs (namely LLaMA2, LLaMA3, and Pythia),\ndemonstrating that it significantly enhances compression performance. The\nexperimental findings reveal that SwiftPrune completes the pruning process\nwithin seconds, achieving an average speedup of 12.29x (up to 56.02x) over\nexisting SOTA approaches.",

    "abstract": "Variate tokenization, which independently embeds each variate as separate\ntokens, has achieved remarkable improvements in multivariate time series\nforecasting. However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a\nquadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus\nlimiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this\nissue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the\ntoken usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop\nadaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the\nnumber of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential\ninformation. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH),\nwhich utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a\nhash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic\nbehaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through\nstratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens,\nthe computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly\nalleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nVarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.",

For our study, we selected SqueezeNet1.1 as it is one of the most\npopular lightweight architectures. SqueezeNet1.1 is a later version of\nSqueezeNet1.0 and is 2.4 times more computationally efficient than the original\nmodel. We proposed and implemented three ultra-lightweight architecture\nvariants to SqueezeNet1.1 architecture, namely Variant 1 (one fire module),\nVariant 2 (two fire modules), and Variant 3 (four fire modules), which are even\nmore compact than SqueezeNetV1.1 (eight fire modules). These models were\nimplemented to evaluate the best performing variant that achieves superior\ncomputational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy in malaria blood cell\nclassification. The models were trained and evaluated using the NIH Malaria\ndataset. We assessed each model's performance based on metrics including\naccuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The\nresults show that the SqueezeNet1.1 model achieves the highest performance\nacross all metrics, with a classification accuracy of 97.12%. Variant 3 (four\nfire modules) offers a competitive alternative, delivering almost identical\nresults (accuracy 96.55%) with a 6x reduction in computational overhead\ncompared to SqueezeNet1.1. Variant 2 and Variant 1 perform slightly lower than\nVariant 3, with Variant 2 (two fire modules) reducing computational overhead by\n28x, and Variant 1 (one fire module) achieving a 54x reduction in trainable\nparameters compared to SqueezeNet1.1. These findings demonstrate that our\nSqueezeNet1.1 architecture variants provide a flexible approach to malaria\ndetection, enabling the selection of a variant that balances resource\nconstraints and performance.",

To address these challenges,\nstrategies such as parallel imaging have been applied, which utilize multiple\nreceiver coils to speed up the data acquisition process. Additionally,\ncompressed sensing (CS) is a method that facilitates image reconstruction from\nsparse data, significantly reducing image acquisition time by minimizing the\namount of data collection needed. Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a\npowerful tool for improving MRI reconstruction. It has been integrated with\nparallel imaging and CS principles to achieve faster and more accurate MRI\nreconstructions. This review comprehensively examines DL-based techniques for\nMRI reconstruction. We categorize and discuss various DL-based methods,\nincluding end-to-end approaches, unrolled optimization, and federated learning,\nhighlighting their potential benefits. Our systematic review highlights\nsignificant contributions and underscores the potential of DL in MRI\nreconstruction. Additionally, we summarize key results and trends in DL-based\nMRI reconstruction, including quantitative metrics, the dataset, acceleration\nfactors, and the progress of and research interest in DL techniques over time.\nFinally, we discuss potential future directions and the importance of DL-based\nMRI reconstruction in advancing medical imaging.

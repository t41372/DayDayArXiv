    "abstract": "Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images, bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing. Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally, this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants, healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image captioning.",

In the cases when we are able to obtain the ground truth, we find that these methods struggle to provide accurate explanations. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven approach to identify artifact regions in deepfake audio. We consider paired real and vocoded audio, and use the difference in time-frequency representation as the ground-truth explanation. The difference signal then serves as a supervision to train a diffusion model to expose the deepfake artifacts in a given vocoded audio. Experimental results on the VocV4 and LibriSeVoc datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional explainability techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.\n  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.\n  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).",

    "abstract": "The use of parallel actors for data collection has been an effective technique used in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The manner in which data is collected in these algorithms, controlled via the number of parallel environments and the rollout length, induces a form of bias-variance trade-off; the number of training passes over the collected data, on the other hand, must strike a balance between sample efficiency and overfitting. We conduct an empirical analysis of these trade-offs on PPO, one of the most popular RL algorithms that uses parallel actors, and establish connections to network plasticity and, more generally, optimization stability. We examine its impact on network architectures, as well as the hyper-parameter sensitivity when scaling data. Our analyses indicate that larger dataset sizes can increase final performance across a variety of settings, and that scaling parallel environments is more effective than increasing rollout lengths. These findings highlight the critical role of data collection strategies in improving agent performance.",

    "abstract": "With the onset of large language models (LLMs), the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly multi-dimensional. Accordingly, there have been several large, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks put forward to evaluate LLMs. Though these frameworks are much more realistic than previous attempts which only used a single score like accuracy, multi-dimensional evaluations can complicate decision-making since there is no obvious way to select an optimal model. This work introduces preference sampling, a method to extract a scalar trustworthiness score from multi-dimensional evaluation results by considering the many characteristics of model performance which users value. We show that preference sampling improves upon alternate aggregation methods by using multi-dimensional trustworthiness evaluations of LLMs from TrustLLM and DecodingTrust. We find that preference sampling is consistently reductive, fully reducing the set of candidate models 100% of the time whereas Pareto optimality never reduces the set by more than 50%. Likewise, preference sampling is consistently sensitive to user priors-allowing users to specify the relative weighting and confidence of their preferences-whereas averaging scores is intransigent to the users' prior knowledge.",

However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalized experiences across industries, yet their adoption and scalability remain hindered by the need for extensive dataset- and task-specific configurations. Existing systems often require significant manual intervention, domain expertise, and engineering effort to adapt to new datasets or tasks, creating barriers to entry and limiting reusability. In contrast, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the transformative potential of reusable systems, where a single model can handle diverse tasks without significant reconfiguration. Inspired by this paradigm, we propose the Dataset- and Task-Independent Recommender System (DTIRS), a framework aimed at maximizing the reusability of recommender systems while minimizing barriers to entry. Unlike LLMs, which achieve task generalization directly, DTIRS focuses on eliminating the need to rebuild or reconfigure recommendation pipelines for every new dataset or task, even though models may still need retraining on new data. By leveraging the novel Dataset Description Language (DsDL), DTIRS enables standardized dataset descriptions and explicit task definitions, allowing autonomous feature engineering, model selection, and optimization. This paper introduces the concept of DTIRS and establishes a roadmap for transitioning from Level-1 automation (dataset-agnostic but task-specific systems) to Level-2 automation (fully dataset- and task-independent systems). Achieving this paradigm would maximize code reusability and lower barriers to adoption. We discuss key challenges, including the trade-offs between generalization and specialization, computational overhead, and scalability, while presenting DsDL as a foundational tool for this vision.",

    "abstract": "Traffic incidents remain a critical public safety concern worldwide, with Australia recording 1,300 road fatalities in 2024, which is the highest toll in 12 years. Similarly, the United States reports approximately 6 million crashes annually, raising significant challenges in terms of a fast reponse time and operational management. Traditional response protocols rely on human decision-making, which introduces potential inconsistencies and delays during critical moments when every minute impacts both safety outcomes and network performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Incident Response Benchmark that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically generate response plans for incoming traffic incidents. Our approach aims to significantly reduce incident resolution times by suggesting context-appropriate actions such as variable message sign deployment, lane closures, and emergency resource allocation adapted to specific incident characteristics. First, the proposed methodology uses real-world incident reports from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) as training and evaluation data. We extract historically implemented actions from these reports and compare them against AI-generated response plans that suggest specific actions, such as lane closures, variable message sign announcements, and/or dispatching appropriate emergency resources. Second, model evaluations reveal that advanced generative AI models like GPT-4o and Grok 2 achieve superior alignment with expert solutions, demonstrated by minimized Hamming distances (averaging 2.96-2.98) and low weighted differences (approximately 0.27-0.28). Conversely, while Gemini 1.5 Pro records the lowest count of missed actions, its extremely high number of unnecessary actions (1547 compared to 225 for GPT-4o) indicates an over-triggering strategy that reduces the overall plan efficiency.",

Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.",

We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. In multimodal retrieval tasks, LEAF improves the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization.

    "abstract": "The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse, and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning enables collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) across decentralized Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) clients, but such models' massive parameter sizes lead to significant memory and communication challenges. This work introduces Meerkat, a sparse zeroth-order optimization (ZO) method designed for federated LLM fine-tuning. By limiting fine-tuning to a transferable, static, extremely sparse subset of parameters, Meerkat achieves remarkable communication efficiency, enabling cost-effective high-frequency synchronization. With theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that this high-frequency communication effectively mitigates Non-IID data challenges and leads to superior performance compared to full-parameter ZO. Furthermore, experiment results show that Meerkat outperforms existing sparsity baselines with better performance at the same communication frequency. To further handle Non-IID drift, Meerkat leverages traceable local updates and forms a virtual path for each client. This virtual path mechanism reveals the GradIP phenomenon: the inner products between LLM pre-training gradients maintained by server and client gradients estimated via ZO converges for extreme Non-IID clients but oscillates for IID ones. This distinct behavior provides a signal for identifying clients with extreme data heterogeneity. Using this signal, Meerkat-vp is proposed to analyze GradIP trajectories to identify extreme Non-IID clients and applies early stopping to enhance aggregated model quality. Experiments confirm that Meerkat and Meerkat-vp significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ZO federated LLM fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "To date, distributional reinforcement learning (distributional RL) methods have exclusively focused on the discounted setting, where an agent aims to optimize a discounted sum of rewards over time. In this work, we extend distributional RL to the average-reward setting, where an agent aims to optimize the reward received per time step. In particular, we utilize a quantile-based approach to develop the first set of algorithms that can successfully learn and/or optimize the long-run per-step reward distribution, as well as the differential return distribution of an average-reward MDP. We derive proven-convergent tabular algorithms for both prediction and control, as well as a broader family of algorithms that have appealing scaling properties. Empirically, we find that these algorithms yield competitive and sometimes superior performance when compared to their non-distributional equivalents, while also capturing rich information about the long-run per-step reward and differential return distributions.",

Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning--the ability to acquire, retain, and refine knowledge over time--has always been fundamental to intelligence, both human and artificial. Historically, different AI paradigms have acknowledged this need, albeit with varying priorities: early expert and production systems focused on incremental knowledge consolidation, while reinforcement learning emphasised dynamic adaptation. With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has primarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to solve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we still need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle diverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual learning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is still necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating knowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information; (ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise, adapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints without full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long context-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular approach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and agents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual pre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we argue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual learning. The future of AI will not be defined by a single static model but by an ecosystem of continually evolving and interacting models, making continual learning more relevant than ever.",

However, we show that one can always construct a choice function via a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a fallback value is encoded as the minimal element in the linear order. The axiomatics of such choice functions are presented for the general case and the case of union-closed input restrictions. Restricted choice structures have applications in knowledge representation and reasoning, and here we discuss their applications for theory change and abstract argumentation.",

Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.",

Unsupervised dictionary learning methods, e.g., sparse autoencoders, can be scaled to produce many steering vectors, but lack guarantees on the individual efficacy of each vector and control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks. In contrast, supervised methods for constructing steering vectors are targeted and effective, but require more data collection and training for each additional steering vector produced. In this work, we introduce HyperSteer, a family of hypernetwork-based architectures which are trained end-to-end to generate steering vectors conditioned on the natural language steering prompts and the internals of the steered LM. In our evaluations, we show that scaling HyperSteer with thousands of steering prompts exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art activation steering methods, even on steering prompts never seen during training. Moreover, HyperSteer performs on par with steering-via-prompting.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25% of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges, Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality impact.",

Conversely, classical symbolic planners offer rigorous safety verification but require significant expert knowledge for setup. To bridge the current gap, this paper proposes ViLaIn-TAMP, a hybrid planning framework for enabling verifiable, interpretable, and autonomous robot behaviors. ViLaIn-TAMP comprises three main components: (1) a Vision-Language Interpreter (ViLaIn) adapted from previous work that converts multimodal inputs into structured problem specifications, (2) a modular Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) system that grounds these specifications in actionable trajectory sequences through symbolic and geometric constraint reasoning, and (3) a corrective planning (CP) module which receives concrete feedback on failed solution attempts and feed them with constraints back to ViLaIn to refine the specification. We design challenging manipulation tasks in a cooking domain and evaluate our framework. Experimental results demonstrate that ViLaIn-TAMP outperforms a VLM-as-a-planner baseline by 18% in mean success rate, and that adding the CP module boosts mean success rate by 32%.",

    "abstract": "Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge. Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources. However, existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM), neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approaches. The results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience research corpus. The performance of the proposed entity and relation extraction method is comparable to the existing supervised method. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction from the unlabeled data. The knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 52% of neuroscience questions from the PubMedQA dataset and questions generated using selected neuroscience entities.",

    "abstract": "One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding, editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8 task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels. Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing automated graphic design applications.

    "abstract": "Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks cover only the most elementary layer of spatial reasoning and are largely approaching saturation in the latest reasoning models. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through careful manual annotation, we construct over 8.4K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial reasoning. We also explore two strategies-PointGraph (explicit scene graph cues) and SpatialCoT (novel-view chain-of-thought)-to bolster spatial reasoning.",

Our theory shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical low-rank adaptation problem.

Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks. Specifically, Critique-GRPO improves average pass@1 scores across all compared methods by approximately +4.4% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and +3.8% on Qwen3-8B. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing, achieving significant gains over GRPO, e.g., +16.7% pass@1 improvement on AIME 2024.",

    "abstract": "As AI technologies improve, people are increasingly willing to delegate tasks to AI agents. In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to delegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the decision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full awareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given decision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating indistinguishable instances -- those that have the same observable features -- as the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal algorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important dimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that the optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal standalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem is not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial, and illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the properties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show that finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However, we are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in several broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be decomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm. Finally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an algorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted by users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal delegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.",

Our framework views the retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks, such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.",

While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality. Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving -- or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more scalable bilevel optimization.",

We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts.

Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications.

To train this compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation.

    "abstract": "The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models. Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.\n  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62% of the explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68% for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the loop optimisation.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for analyzing graph-structured data in domains such as drug discovery and financial analysis, leading to growing demands for model transparency. Recent advances in explainable GNNs have addressed this need by revealing important subgraphs that influence predictions, but these explanation mechanisms may inadvertently expose models to security risks. This paper investigates how such explanations potentially leak critical decision logic that can be exploited for model stealing. We propose {\\method}, a novel stealing framework that integrates explanation alignment for capturing decision logic with guided data augmentation for efficient training under limited queries, enabling effective replication of both the predictive behavior and underlying reasoning patterns of target models. Experiments on molecular graph datasets demonstrate that our approach shows advantages over conventional methods in model stealing. This work highlights important security considerations for the deployment of explainable GNNs in sensitive domains and suggests the need for protective measures against explanation-based attacks.

    "abstract": "An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data, and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and, conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it. We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages.",

    "abstract": "Training language models on long sequence data is a demanding requirement for enhancing the model's capability on complex tasks, e.g., long-chain reasoning. However, as the sequence length scales up, the memory cost for storing activation values becomes huge during the Backpropagation (BP) process, even with the application of gradient checkpointing technique. To tackle this challenge, we propose a memory-efficient and exact BP method called StreamBP, which performs a linear decomposition of the chain rule along the sequence dimension in a layer-wise manner, significantly reducing the memory cost of activation values and logits. The proposed method is applicable to common objectives such as SFT, GRPO, and DPO. From an implementation perspective, StreamBP achieves less computational FLOPs and faster BP speed by leveraging the causal structure of the language model. Compared to gradient checkpointing, StreamBP scales up the maximum sequence length of BP by 2.8-5.5 times larger, while using comparable or even less BP time. Note that StreamBP's sequence length scaling ability can be directly transferred to batch size scaling for accelerating training. We further develop a communication-efficient distributed StreamBP to effectively support multi-GPU training and broaden its applicability. Our code can be easily integrated into the training pipeline of any transformer models and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/StreamBP.",

    "abstract": "While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns: diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\\% attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1), Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\\times$, 2.38$\\times$, and 1.67$\\times$ theoretical FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\\times$, 1.85$\\times$, and 1.58$\\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) face a critical safety challenge: as capabilities scale, instrumental convergence drives default trajectories toward loss of human control, potentially culminating in existential catastrophe. Current alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose \"Corrigibility as a Singular Target\" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies (RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental convergence.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning agents are often fragile while humans remain adaptive and flexible to varying scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present EDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned entorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable autonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system, EDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation using visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder that transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these activations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in the lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the high-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to a policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic, goal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid prototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise. Compared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity) or standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate, within the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded paths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a replacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell encoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and motion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within biological mammals. This work represents a step toward biologically grounded spatial intelligence in robotics, bridging neural navigation principles with reinforcement learning for scalable deployment.",

Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological, educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions.",

However, RLHF's feedback mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer.

    "abstract": "Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang, together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of AI decision-making.",

In this paper, we propose and investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.",

    "abstract": "Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions -- their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal rules that answer the questions \"When are two AI systems the same?\" and \"When does an AI system persist, despite change?\" Building on Carrara and Vermaas' account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities across diverse tasks, raising the question of whether they acquire internal world models. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial representations are functionally used by the model. Our results provide empirical evidence that LLMs encode linear spatial world models.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents (factor analyst and argument polisher) in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate reflective multi-agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: \"arguable\", \"mismatched\", and \"non-arguable\". Results demonstrate that the reflective multi-agent approach excels at successful abstention by preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded, improves hallucination accuracy by reducing fabricated and misattributed factors and enhances factor utilization recall by better using the provided case facts. These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems.",

Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, detection rates remain low because launderers evade oversight, confirmed cases are rare, and institutions see only fragments of the global transaction network. Since access to real transaction data is tightly restricted, synthetic datasets are essential for developing and evaluating detection methods. However, existing datasets fall short: they often neglect partial observability, temporal dynamics, strategic behavior, uncertain labels, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. We introduce AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. AMLGentex enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering systems under conditions that mirror real-world challenges. By releasing multiple country-specific datasets and practical parameter guidance, we aim to empower researchers and practitioners and provide a common foundation for collaboration and progress in combating money laundering.",

    "abstract": "Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.\n  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information. Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.\n  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.\n  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.",

    "abstract": "The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD, the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset, sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies, setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of predicting future evolution (Task 2).",

Existing literature primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models show superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for improvement.",

    "abstract": "Generative models have become increasingly powerful tools for robot motion generation, enabling flexible and multimodal trajectory generation across various tasks. Yet, most existing approaches remain limited in handling multiple types of constraints, such as collision avoidance, actuation limits, and dynamic consistency, which are typically addressed individually or heuristically. In this work, we propose UniConFlow, a unified constrained flow matching-based framework for trajectory generation that systematically incorporates both equality and inequality constraints. Moreover, UniConFlow introduces a novel prescribed-time zeroing function that shapes a time-varying guidance field during inference, allowing the generation process to adapt to varying system models and task requirements. Furthermore, to further address the computational challenges of long-horizon and high-dimensional trajectory generation, we propose two practical strategies for the terminal constraint enforcement and inference process: a violation-segment extraction protocol that precisely localizes and refines only the constraint-violating portions of trajectories, and a trajectory compression method that accelerates optimization in a reduced-dimensional space while preserving high-fidelity reconstruction after decoding. Empirical validation across three experiments, including a double inverted pendulum, a real-to-sim car racing task, and a sim-to-real manipulation task, demonstrates that UniConFlow outperforms state-of-the-art generative planners and conventional optimization baselines, achieving superior performance on certified motion planning metrics such as safety, kinodynamic consistency, and action feasibility.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components: (i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention, considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT) model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.",

    "abstract": "Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600 real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile sensing and active perception.",

    "abstract": "This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS) algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling, often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation. To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS) is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.",

    "abstract": "As the complexity of AI systems and their interactions with the world increases, generating explanations for their behaviour is important for safely deploying AI. For agents, the most natural abstractions for predicting behaviour attribute beliefs, intentions and goals to the system. If an agent behaves as if it has a certain goal or belief, then we can make reasonable predictions about how it will behave in novel situations, including those where comprehensive safety evaluations are untenable. How well can we infer an agent's beliefs from their behaviour, and how reliably can these inferred beliefs predict the agent's behaviour in novel situations? We provide a precise answer to this question under the assumption that the agent's behaviour is guided by a world model. Our contribution is the derivation of novel bounds on the agent's behaviour in new (unseen) deployment environments, which represent a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents from behavioural data alone. We discuss the implications of these results for several research areas including fairness and safety.",

We propose dynamics modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without repeatedly querying the oracle environment.",

    "abstract": "Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast, human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions, and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0% batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and emergent expert-like reasoning.

To mitigate the substantial computational and memory costs of full-model fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed to update only a small subset of model parameters. However, performance gaps between PEFT approaches and full-model fine-tuning still exist. In this work, we present DiaBlo, a simple yet effective PEFT approach that updates only the diagonal blocks of selected model weight matrices. Unlike Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, DiaBlo eliminates the need for low rank matrix products, thereby avoiding the reliance on auxiliary initialization schemes or customized optimization strategies to improve convergence. This design leads to stable and robust convergence while maintaining comparable memory efficiency and training speed to LoRA. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment, to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of DiaBlo. Across these benchmarks, DiaBlo demonstrates strong and consistent performance while maintaining high memory efficiency and fast finetuning speed.

    "abstract": "Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information (MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases. Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall, our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "Recent studies, including DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi-k1.5, have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with rule-based, binary-valued reward functions can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. These models primarily utilize REINFORCE-based policy optimization techniques, such as REINFORCE with baseline and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). However, a key limitation remains: current policy optimization methods either neglect reward normalization or employ static normalization strategies, which fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of policy updates during training. This may result in unstable gradient estimates and hinder training stability. To address this issue, we propose Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), a novel policy optimization method that adaptively normalizes rewards using a Beta distribution with dynamically updated parameters. BNPO aligns the normalization with the changing policy distribution, enabling more precise and lower-variance gradient estimation, which in turn promotes stable training dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating BNPO's variance-reducing properties and show that it generalizes both REINFORCE and GRPO under binary-valued reward settings. Furthermore, we introduce an advantage decomposition mechanism to extend BNPO's applicability to more complex reward systems. Experimental results confirm that BNPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among policy optimization methods on reasoning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/BNPO.",

However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.",

To address these challenges, we propose Tru-POMDP, a planner that combines structured belief generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) with principled POMDP planning. Tru-POMDP introduces a hierarchical Tree of Hypotheses (TOH), which systematically queries an LLM to construct high-quality particle beliefs over possible world states and human goals. We further formulate an open-ended POMDP model that enables rigorous Bayesian belief tracking and efficient belief-space planning over these LLM-generated hypotheses. Experiments on complex object rearrangement tasks across diverse kitchen environments show that Tru-POMDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and LLM-tree-search hybrid planners, achieving higher success rates with significantly better plans, stronger robustness to ambiguity and occlusion, and greater planning efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the security of multi-agent systems (MASs) powered by large language models (LLMs) is challenging, primarily because of the systems' complex internal dynamics and the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities. Traditional attack graph (AG) methods often lack the specific capabilities to model attacks on LLMs. This paper introduces AI-agent application Threat assessment with Attack Graphs (ATAG), a novel framework designed to systematically analyze the security risks associated with AI-agent applications. ATAG extends the MulVAL logic-based AG generation tool with custom facts and interaction rules to accurately represent AI-agent topologies, vulnerabilities, and attack scenarios. As part of this research, we also created the LLM vulnerability database (LVD) to initiate the process of standardizing LLM vulnerabilities documentation. To demonstrate ATAG's efficacy, we applied it to two multi-agent applications. Our case studies demonstrated the framework's ability to model and generate AGs for sophisticated, multi-step attack scenarios exploiting vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, excessive agency, sensitive information disclosure, and insecure output handling across interconnected agents. ATAG is an important step toward a robust methodology and toolset to help understand, visualize, and prioritize complex attack paths in multi-agent AI systems (MAASs). It facilitates proactive identification and mitigation of AI-agent threats in multi-agent applications.",

While existing methods rely on task-specific training, we explore whether pretrained diffusion models, originally designed for audio generation, can inherently perform separation without further training. In this study, we introduce a training-free framework leveraging generative priors for zero-shot LASS. Analyzing naive adaptations, we identify key limitations arising from modality-specific challenges. To address these issues, we propose Diffusion-Guided Mask Optimization (DGMO), a test-time optimization framework that refines spectrogram masks for precise, input-aligned separation. Our approach effectively repurposes pretrained diffusion models for source separation, achieving competitive performance without task-specific supervision. This work expands the application of diffusion models beyond generation, establishing a new paradigm for zero-shot audio separation. The code is available at: https://wltschmrz.github.io/DGMO/",

To address this limitation, we introduce the Directed Cellular Sheaf, a special type of cellular sheaf designed to explicitly account for edge orientation. Building on this structure, we define a new sheaf Laplacian, the Directed Sheaf Laplacian, which captures both the graph's topology and its directional information. This operator serves as the backbone of the Directed Sheaf Neural Network (DSNN), the first SNN model to embed a directional bias into its architecture.

    "abstract": "Web agents for online shopping have shown great promise in automating user interactions across e-commerce platforms. Benchmarks for assessing such agents do not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often consist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as \"Find iPhone 15.\" Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving multi-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting preferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed to evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments. DeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution: Starting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five popular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further evolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels: easy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and holistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses agent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through holistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show that RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction, while other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting preferences, leading to low overall success rates. We also perform cross-category, complexity-based evaluations and error analyses to support the advancement of deep research shopping agents.",

While recent LLM-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from limited patient information. In this paper, we propose ReinRAG, a reinforced reasoning augmented generation (RAG) for long-form discharge instructions based on pre-admission information. ReinRAG retrieves reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph to provide explicit semantic guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose group-based retriever optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with group-normalized rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the real-world dataset show that ReinRAG outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics. Further analysis reveals that ReinRAG fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.",

    "abstract": "In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVA and GPT-4V, the direction of using these models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve ``manual-annotation-free\" training for downstream tasks has become a highly promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a ``Co-Pseudo-Labeling\" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Specifically, we construct multiple anti-overfitting mechanisms that efficiently mine latent information from noisy partially labeled samples including alternating optimization of contrastive feature representations and pseudo-labels, as well as maintaining prototypical class vectors in the shared feature space.",

This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \\emph{Minimal Unsat Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the compressed network.

In the pursuit of glass box models - as opposed to black box models, like random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and promising avenue, as the rules can easily be understood by humans. In our previous work, we introduced FRRI, a novel rule induction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set theory. We demonstrated experimentally that FRRI outperformed other rule induction methods with regards to accuracy and number of rules. FRRI leverages a fuzzy indiscernibility relation to partition the data space into fuzzy granules, which are then combined into a minimal covering set of rules. This indiscernibility relation is constructed by removing attributes from rules in a greedy way. This raises the question: does the order of the attributes matter? In this paper, we show that optimising only the order of attributes using known methods from fuzzy rough set theory and classical machine learning does not improve the performance of FRRI on multiple metrics. However, removing a small number of attributes using fuzzy rough feature selection during this step positively affects balanced accuracy and the average rule length.",

Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas, viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information, including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes.

Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model performance evaluation. This paper presents a systematic empirical study to investigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our study involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs, namely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code generation, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only, output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.\n  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects. In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly affected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of code intelligence models.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid parallelism techniques are essential for efficiently training large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, current automatic parallel planning frameworks often overlook the simultaneous consideration of node heterogeneity and dynamic network topology changes, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications. In this paper, we address these limitations by modeling heterogeneous nodes within dynamically changing network environments and leveraging simulation-based strategies to determine optimal parallel configurations. Our approach enables fine-grained workload allocation tailored for heterogeneous nodes and complex network scenarios, achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods under regular and stable network conditions. Additionally, we introduce a strategy pruning technique to rapidly discard infeasible parallel configurations, substantially reducing the search space and accelerating the search process through parallel execution within the simulator. Preliminary evaluations confirm that our method notably enhances training performance on heterogeneous nodes and demonstrates improved adaptability in complex, dynamic scenarios such as cloud computing environments.",

    "abstract": "A neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a machine learning model that is commonly described as a continuous-depth generalization of a residual network (ResNet) with a single residual block, or conversely, the ResNet can be seen as the Euler discretization of the neural ODE. These two models are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either model are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In this work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by bounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained error bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for the other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable output set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of the models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the other model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety verification can be run indifferently on either of the two models. This novel approach is illustrated on a numerical example of a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.",

    "abstract": "As multimodal machine intelligence systems started achieving average animal-level and average human-level fluency in many measurable tasks in processing images, language, and sound, they began to exhibit a new class of cognitive aberrations: machine mirages. These include delusion, illusion, confabulation, hallucination, misattribution error, semantic drift, semantic compression, exaggeration, causal inference failure, uncanny valley of perception, bluffing-patter-bullshitting, cognitive stereotypy, pragmatic misunderstanding, hypersignification, semantic reheating-warming, simulated authority effect, fallacious abductive leap, contextual drift, referential hallucination, semiotic Frankenstein effect, calibration failure, spurious correlation, bias amplification, concept drift sensitivity, misclassification under uncertainty, adversarial vulnerability, overfitting, prosodic misclassification, accent bias, turn boundary failure, semantic boundary confusion, noise overfitting, latency-induced decision drift, ambiguity collapse and other forms of error that mimic but do not replicate human or animal fallibility. This article presents some of the errors and argues that these failures must be explicitly defined and systematically assessed. Understanding machine mirages is essential not only for improving machine intelligence reliability but also for constructing a multiscale ethical, co-evolving intelligence ecosystem that respects the diverse forms of life, cognition, and expression it will inevitably touch.",

    "abstract": "With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning (MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU) still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially for preservation and robustness.

To date, its assessment by automated systems has typically examined the context-independent, or part-of-speech (PoS) related use of words. This paper introduces a novel approach to enable fine-grained vocabulary evaluation exploiting the precise use of words within a sentence. The scheme combines large language models (LLMs) with the English Vocabulary Profile (EVP). The EVP is a standard lexical resource that enables in-context vocabulary use to be linked with proficiency level. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to assign proficiency levels to individual words as they appear in L2 learner writing, addressing key challenges such as polysemy, contextual variation, and multi-word expressions. We compare LLMs to a PoS-based baseline. LLMs appear to exploit additional semantic information that yields improved performance. We also explore correlations between word-level proficiency and essay-level proficiency. Finally, the approach is applied to examine the consistency of the EVP proficiency levels. Results show that LLMs are well-suited for the task of vocabulary assessment.",

To tackle the problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular anomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled representation learning within a projection space and extracting normal dependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model involves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the data space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning shared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple masked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association prototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives from a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning and association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport problems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly scores. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 20 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters.",

Most existing approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM) in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns. CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting their critical role in multilingual scenarios.",

In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the predicted tensor to reduce overfitting. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our regularization technique as well as the reliability of our theoretical analysis.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align (Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness, application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process transparency in complex vertical domains.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference. Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.",

While conventional methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model, OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract complementary functionality information from two modules and model their interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\\% on R2. Further generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and targeted carbon mitigation planning.

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments. However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.",

In this work, we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for unrestricted need prediction. PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow's hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs. For evaluation and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIGEON significantly outperforms closed-set approaches on need-based life service recall by an average of 19.37%. Human evaluation validates the reasonableness and specificity of our predictions.

While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration. Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend: Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.",

We present a case study showing how a minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\\% recall despite fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research.

State-of-the-art propagation modeling tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models. However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included in the training.

    "abstract": "Hallucination remains a key obstacle to the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world question answering tasks. A widely adopted strategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the model's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers. However, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely reflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As bias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from the underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable signal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific Prompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These representations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful view of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically generates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to amplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A contrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and separate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic behavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more reliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP significantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination detection benchmarks.",

These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\\% compared to existing models.",

In this paper, we aim to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.",

Although deep learning-based methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data sparsity. Code will be open.",

    "abstract": "A public safety Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enhances situational awareness in emergency response. Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public safety. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud, further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential jailbreaking vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss LLM optimizers and specify future research directions. The ICL framework enables adaptive, context-aware decision-making for public safety UAV, thus offering a lightweight and efficient solution for enhancing UAV autonomy and responsiveness in emergencies.",

However, whether LLMs possess genuine fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and generalize rules in novel situations) remains an open question. Existing reasoning benchmarks either focus on domain-specific knowledge (crystallized intelligence) or lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose DRE-Bench, a dynamic reasoning evaluation benchmark grounded in a hierarchical cognitive framework. DRE-Bench consists of 36 abstract reasoning tasks organized across four cognitive levels, with each task featuring multiple dynamic variants that test the same underlying latent rule. This design enables fine-grained, interpretable, and reliable assessments of fluid intelligence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7) and reasoning LLMs (o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Skywork-OR1). Experimental results reveal that although most LLMs achieve competent and robust performance in low-level cognition, they struggle with high-level cognition and exhibit limited generalization as task complexity grows. Our findings highlight the gap between current LLMs and true human-like fluid intelligence and offer a new path for systematically tracking reasoning progress in LLMs.",

In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.",

    "abstract": "Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective, balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost. This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures. Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS, this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process. Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal solutions for heterogeneous task settings.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), have demonstrated excellent capabilities in processing heterogeneous information networks. Self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised strategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this approach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies and the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level of similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal Transport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised learning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies. Different from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs the optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of positive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view (central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views represented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an optimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the semantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the optimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations, forcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the graph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node classification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree, where answering high-level questions (e.g., \"Is it possible for the ego vehicle to turn left at the intersection?\") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g., \"Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite direction?\"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent, contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover, qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, traffic flow prediction has become a highlight in the field of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the temporal variations and dynamic spatial correlations of traffic data, traffic prediction remains highly challenging.Traditional spatiotemporal networks, which rely on end-to-end training, often struggle to handle the diverse data dependencies of multiple traffic flow patterns. Additionally, traffic flow variations are highly sensitive to temporal information changes. Regrettably, other researchers have not sufficiently recognized the importance of temporal information.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called A Time-Enhanced Data Disentanglement Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting (TEDDN). This network disentangles the originally complex and intertwined traffic data into stable patterns and trends. By flexibly learning temporal and node information through a dynamic graph enhanced by a temporal feature extraction module, TEDDN demonstrates significant efficacy in disentangling and extracting complex traffic information. Experimental evaluations and ablation studies on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method.",

Drawing on early cybernetics, rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding drama. Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools, forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in contemporary art.",

Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address this gap, we propose \\benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative, Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the \\textit{Open-Ended} and \\textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained, genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \\benchName, we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future research on improving essay generation in educational settings.",

In this work, we introduce EALG (Evolutionary Adversarial Generation of Language Model-Guided Generators), a novel framework that automates the co-evolution of optimization problem instances and their corresponding heuristic solvers using large language models (LLMs). EALG leverages a mutation-based adversarial approach that dynamically evolves instance generation procedures to create increasingly difficult problems, while simultaneously synthesizing adaptive heuristic algorithms through interactions with LLMs guided by algorithmic structure. Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on static benchmark creation or manual solver design, EALG provides a seamless pipeline from instance generation to solver synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EALG generates significantly harder instances than current benchmarks, and its synthesized solvers generalize effectively across a broad spectrum of combinatorial tasks. This work explores a new paradigm for combinatorial optimization that integrates instance generation with solver design, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.",

Key findings highlight the superior performance of GPT-4o when provided with specific prompting for JSON output, achieving an F1 score of 0.93. Furthermore, GPT-4 demonstrated the highest precision at 0.99. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of current NER model capabilities and limitations when applied to morphologically rich languages like Russian within the cultural heritage domain, offering insights for researchers and practitioners.

Sharing the global advantage among agents often leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima. These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment for improving MARL performance.",

This study leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed pitch, energy, and voice activity features.

    "abstract": "The EU has become one of the vanguards in regulating the digital age. A particularly important regulation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain is the EU AI Act, which entered into force in 2024. The AI Act specifies -- due to a risk-based approach -- various obligations for providers of AI systems. These obligations, for example, include a cascade of documentation and compliance measures, which represent a potential obstacle to science. But do these obligations also apply to AI researchers? This position paper argues that, indeed, the AI Act's obligations could apply in many more cases than the AI community is aware of. In our analysis of the AI Act and its applicability, we contribute the following: 1.) We give a high-level introduction to the AI Act aimed at non-legal AI research scientists. 2.) We explain with everyday research examples why the AI Act applies to research. 3.) We analyse the exceptions of the AI Act's applicability and state that especially scientific research exceptions fail to account for current AI research practices. 4.) We propose changes to the AI Act to provide more legal certainty for AI researchers and give two recommendations for AI researchers to reduce the risk of not complying with the AI Act. We see our paper as a starting point for a discussion between policymakers, legal scholars, and AI researchers to avoid unintended side effects of the AI Act on research.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving (AD) has achieved significant progress, yet single-vehicle perception remains constrained by sensing range and occlusions. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication addresses these limits by enabling collaboration across vehicles and infrastructure, but it also faces heterogeneity, synchronization, and latency constraints. Language models offer strong knowledge-driven reasoning and decision-making capabilities, but they are not inherently designed to process raw sensor streams and are prone to hallucination. We propose V2X-UniPool, the first framework that unifies V2X perception with language-based reasoning for knowledge-driven AD. It transforms multimodal V2X data into structured, language-based knowledge, organizes it in a time-indexed knowledge pool for temporally consistent reasoning, and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground decisions in real-time context. Experiments on the real-world DAIR-V2X dataset show that V2X-UniPool achieves state-of-the-art planning accuracy and safety while reducing communication cost by more than 80\\%, achieving the lowest overhead among evaluated methods. These results highlight the promise of bridging V2X perception and language reasoning to advance scalable and trustworthy driving.

Recently, attention-based methods have been used to adequately capture the dynamic nature of spatio-temporal data. However, existing methods that rely on heuristic masking strategies cannot fully adapt to the complex spatio-temporal correlations, hindering the model from focusing on the right context. These works also overlook the high-level correlations that exist in the real world. Effectively integrating these high-level correlations with the original correlations is crucial. To fill this gap, we propose the Aggregation Differential Transformer (ADFormer), which offers new insights to demand forecasting promotion. Specifically, we utilize Differential Attention to capture the original spatial correlations and achieve attention denoising. Meanwhile, we design distinct aggregation strategies based on the nature of space and time. Then, the original correlations are unified with the high-level correlations, enabling the model to capture holistic spatio-temporal relations. Experiments conducted on taxi and bike datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our model, demonstrating its practical value.

While various top-$k$ attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA (Hash-Aware Top-$k$ Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-$k$ attention process. Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to 7.2$\\times$ speedup compared to vanilla full attention while maintaining model accuracy. In addition, HATA outperforms the state-of-the-art top-$k$ attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple mainstream LLM models and diverse tasks.

Prevailing LLM-based graph methods excel in adapting LLMs to text-rich graphs, wherein node attributes are text descriptions. However, their applications to multimodal graphs--where nodes are associated with diverse attribute types, such as texts and images--remain underexplored, despite their ubiquity in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA), an innovative model that adeptly extends LLM capabilities to facilitate reasoning over complex graph structures and multimodal attributes. We first design a structure-aware multimodal encoder to align textual and visual attributes within a unified space through a joint graph pre-training objective. Subsequently, we implement a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to seamlessly integrate multimodal features and graph structures into the LLM through lightweight projectors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MLaGA compared to leading baseline methods, achieving superior performance in diverse graph learning tasks under both supervised and transfer learning scenarios.",

Compared to math word problems, geometry problems further emphasize multi-modal formats and the translation between informal and formal languages. In this paper, we introduce a novel task for geometry problem generation and propose a new pipeline method: the Symbolic Deduction Engine-based Geometry Problem Generation framework (SDE-GPG). The framework leverages a symbolic deduction engine and contains four main steps: (1) searching a predefined mapping table from knowledge points to extended definitions, (2) sampling extended definitions and performing symbolic deduction, (3) filtering out unqualified problems, and (4) generating textual problems and diagrams. Specifically, our method supports to avoid inherent biases in translating natural language into formal language by designing the mapping table, and guarantees to control the generated problems in terms of knowledge points and difficulties by an elaborate checking function. With obtained formal problems, they are translated to natural language and the accompanying diagrams are automatically drew by rule-based methods. We conduct experiments using real-world combinations of knowledge points from two public datasets. The results demonstrate that the SDE-GPG can effectively generate readable, solvable and controllable geometry problems.",

Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles. High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\\textrm{F}_1$ score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU.

    "abstract": "We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e., intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward, while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CorrineQiu/Ego4D-LTA-Challenge-2025.",

However, existing evaluations fall short, because they are based on small-scale benchmarks and only measure static outcomes, failing to capture the full, dynamic range of real-world security challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities across 188 software projects. Adjustable to different vulnerability analysis settings, CyberGym primarily tasks agents with generating a proof-of-concept test that reproduces a vulnerability, given only its text description and the corresponding codebase. Our extensive evaluation highlights that CyberGym effectively differentiates agents' and models' cybersecurity capabilities. Even the top-performing combinations only achieve a ~20% success rate, demonstrating the overall difficulty of CyberGym. Beyond static benchmarking, we show that CyberGym leads to the discovery of 35 zero-day vulnerabilities and 17 historically incomplete patches. These results underscore that CyberGym is not only a robust benchmark for measuring AI's progress in cybersecurity but also a platform for creating direct, real-world security impact.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \\textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.",

However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models.

We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten targets.",

    "abstract": "Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks.

For site navigation, the system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating form-interaction testing.

To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios. ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Kubernetes, a notably complex and distributed system, utilizes an array of controllers to uphold cluster management logic through state reconciliation. Nevertheless, maintaining state consistency presents significant challenges due to unexpected failures, network disruptions, and asynchronous issues, especially within dynamic cloud environments. These challenges result in operational disruptions and economic losses, underscoring the necessity for robust root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance Kubernetes reliability. The development of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising direction for RCA. However, existing methodologies encounter several obstacles, including the diverse and evolving nature of Kubernetes incidents, the intricate context of incidents, and the polymorphic nature of these incidents. In this paper, we introduce SynergyRCA, an innovative tool that leverages LLMs with retrieval augmentation from graph databases and enhancement with expert prompts. SynergyRCA constructs a StateGraph to capture spatial and temporal relationships and utilizes a MetaGraph to outline entity connections. Upon the occurrence of an incident, an LLM predicts the most pertinent resource, and SynergyRCA queries the MetaGraph and StateGraph to deliver context-specific insights for RCA. We evaluate SynergyRCA using datasets from two production Kubernetes clusters, highlighting its capacity to identify numerous root causes, including novel ones, with high efficiency and precision. SynergyRCA demonstrates the ability to identify root causes in an average time of about two minutes and achieves an impressive precision of approximately 0.90.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing quality.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires increasingly threaten human life, ecosystems, and infrastructure, with events like the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County underscoring the urgent need for more advanced prediction frameworks. Existing physics-based and deep learning models struggle to capture dynamic wildfire spread across both 2D and 3D domains, especially when incorporating real-time, multimodal geospatial data. This paper explores how generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models-such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers-can serve as transformative tools for wildfire prediction and simulation. These models offer superior capabilities in managing uncertainty, integrating multimodal inputs, and generating realistic, scalable wildfire scenarios. We introduce a new paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) for literature synthesis, classification, and knowledge extraction, conducting a systematic review of recent studies applying generative AI to fire prediction and monitoring. We highlight how generative approaches uniquely address challenges faced by traditional simulation and deep learning methods. Finally, we outline five key future directions for generative AI in wildfire management, including unified multimodal modeling of 2D and 3D dynamics, agentic AI systems and chatbots for decision intelligence, and real-time scenario generation on mobile devices, along with a discussion of critical challenges. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift toward multimodal generative frameworks to support proactive, data-informed wildfire response.",

    "abstract": "Evaluations of LLMs' ethical risks and value inclinations often rely on short-form surveys and psychometric tests, yet real-world use involves long-form, open-ended responses -- leaving value-related risks and preferences in practical settings largely underexplored. In this work, we ask: Do value preferences inferred from short-form tests align with those expressed in long-form outputs? To address this question, we compare value preferences elicited from short-form reactions and long-form responses, varying the number of arguments in the latter to capture users' differing verbosity preferences. Analyzing five LLMs (llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, and olmo-7b), we find (1) a weak correlation between value preferences inferred from short-form and long-form responses across varying argument counts, and (2) similarly weak correlation between preferences derived from any two distinct long-form generation settings. (3) Alignment yields only modest gains in the consistency of value expression. Further, we examine how long-form generation attributes relate to value preferences, finding that argument specificity negatively correlates with preference strength, while representation across scenarios shows a positive correlation. Our findings underscore the need for more robust methods to ensure consistent value expression across diverse applications.",

While prior work has focused on browser-based agents and HTML-level attacks, the vulnerabilities of CUAs remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are visually embedded within rendered user interfaces, and examine their impact on both CUAs and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs). We propose VPI-Bench, a benchmark of 306 test cases across five widely used platforms, to evaluate agent robustness under VPI threats. Each test case is a variant of a web platform, designed to be interactive, deployed in a realistic environment, and containing a visually embedded malicious prompt. Our empirical study shows that current CUAs and BUAs can be deceived at rates of up to 51% and 100%, respectively, on certain platforms. The experimental results also indicate that system prompt defenses offer only limited improvements. These findings highlight the need for robust, context-aware defenses to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal AI agents in real-world environments.

This novel task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse, high-quality visualizations.

For the evaluation of generated multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100 diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of Multimodal DeepResearcher.

As the globe becomes increasingly dependent on technology and automated processes, ensuring secured systems, applications, and networks has become one of the most significant problems of this era. The global web and digital technology have significantly accelerated the evolution of the modern world, necessitating the use of telecommunications and data transfer platforms. Researchers are enhancing the effectiveness of IDS by incorporating popular datasets into machine learning algorithms. IDS, equipped with machine learning classifiers, enhances security attack detection accuracy by identifying normal or abnormal network traffic. This paper explores the methods of capturing and reviewing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and evaluates the challenges existing datasets face. A deluge of research on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) architecture-based intrusion detection techniques has been conducted in the past ten years on various cybersecurity datasets, including KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS-2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. We conducted a literature review and presented an in-depth analysis of various intrusion detection methods that use SVM, KNN, DT, LR, NB, RF, XGBOOST, Adaboost, and ANN. We provide an overview of each technique, explaining the role of the classifiers and algorithms used. A detailed tabular analysis highlights the datasets used, classifiers employed, attacks detected, evaluation metrics, and conclusions drawn.

It maps diverse brain recordings into a unified semantic space defined by a pre-trained multilingual model (PMM), enabling decoding across multiple languages, multiple subjects and multiple neuroimaging modalities. The proposed framework is validated using non-invasive brain recordings from 159 participants across four languages. Experimental results show that it exhibits strong generalization across multilingual, multi-subject, and multimodal settings. More importantly, the proposed framework can promote linguistic fairness, which is vital for underrepresented languages in BCI applications. The unified semantic space enables cross-lingual mapping enhancement, allowing the framework to boost the decoding performance of underrepresented languages, thereby promoting linguistic fairness. Overall, the proposed framework establishes a new potential paradigm for brain decoding, opening new paths for broader applications of BCI.",

Motivated by shortcomings in tabular deep learning pipelines - revealed through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis - we revisit and repurpose random Fourier mappings as a parameter-free, architecture-agnostic transformation. By projecting each input into a fixed feature space via sine and cosine projections with frequencies drawn once at initialization, this approach circumvents the need for ad hoc normalization or additional learnable embeddings. We show within the NTK framework that this mapping (i) bounds and conditions the network's initial NTK spectrum, and (ii) introduces a bias that shortens the optimization trajectory, thereby accelerating gradient-based training. These effects pre-condition the network with a stable kernel from the outset. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep networks trained on Fourier-transformed inputs converge more rapidly and consistently achieve strong final performance, often with fewer epochs and less hyperparameter tuning. Our findings establish random Fourier pre-processing as a theoretically motivated, plug-and-play enhancement for tabular deep learning.",

Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \\((i)\\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \\((ii)\\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \\((iii)\\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model. However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's -31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model (14.0% win rate).",

    "abstract": "Human cognition operates through two complementary modes: fast intuitive thinking and slow deliberate thinking. Vanilla large language models (LLMs) predominantly follow the fast-thinking paradigm, producing immediate responses; while recent large reasoning models (LRMs) adopt slow-thinking strategies, generating detailed reasoning chains before arriving at answers. While LRMs often achieve higher accuracy, this comes at the cost of substantially increased token usage. To address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose OThink-R1, a hybrid reasoning framework that integrates both modes within a single LRM and enables automatic mode switching based on problem characteristics. We first identify three major patterns of essential and redundant reasoning trajectories in LRMs, which guide the design of an auxiliary LLM-based judge that adaptively determines when slow thinking is necessary. Leveraging the judge's decisions, we construct a hybrid fine-tuning dataset by pruning redundant reasoning to produce fast-thinking samples and retaining complete reasoning for slow-thinking samples. This dataset is then used to fine-tune LRMs, equipping them with inherent autonomous mode-selection capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical and question-answering benchmarks show that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning token usage significantly while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Building upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings.

Nonetheless, the high rejection rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the overall efficiency gain of SD. In this work, we revisit existing verification mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD). Unlike SD, which relies on a metric derived from importance sampling for verification, CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods computed solely by the LLM. CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation quality (around 100% of the target model's performance). Interestingly, this is achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of magnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents the upper bound for speculative decoding.",

However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.",

In contrast, real-world scenarios often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and textual contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic abilities in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises ten vision-grounded environments that cover cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions. The performance of VLM agents is evaluated across three dimensions: perception measured by element recognition accuracy; strategic reasoning measured by next-action prediction accuracy; and decision-making measured by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments on fifteen leading VLMs show that, although current models exhibit strong perception abilities, there remains a significant gap to optimal performance in reasoning and decision-making, with the best-performing model attaining 46.6% prediction accuracy and 31.4% normalized return. We further analyze the key factors influencing performance, conduct human experiments, and examine failure modes to provide a deeper understanding of VLMs' strategic abilities. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on strategic multimodal agents.

    "abstract": "The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability approaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple setting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address this gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We introduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that guarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay rate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the identification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations across various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",

Building on this approach, we introduce an advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and robust decision-making.

    "abstract": "Model extraction attacks aim to replicate the functionality of a black-box model through query access, threatening the intellectual property (IP) of machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) providers. Defending against such attacks is challenging, as it must balance efficiency, robustness, and utility preservation in the real-world scenario. Despite the recent advances, most existing defenses presume that attacker queries have out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, enabling them to detect and disrupt suspicious inputs. However, this assumption is increasingly unreliable, as modern models are trained on diverse datasets and attackers often operate under limited query budgets. As a result, the effectiveness of these defenses is significantly compromised in realistic deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we propose MISLEADER (enseMbles of dIStiLled modEls Against moDel ExtRaction), a novel defense strategy that does not rely on OOD assumptions. MISLEADER formulates model protection as a bilevel optimization problem that simultaneously preserves predictive fidelity on benign inputs and reduces extractability by potential clone models. Our framework combines data augmentation to simulate attacker queries with an ensemble of heterogeneous distilled models to improve robustness and diversity. We further provide a tractable approximation algorithm and derive theoretical error bounds to characterize defense effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various settings validate the utility-preserving and extraction-resistant properties of our proposed defense strategy.

A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a high-level safety principle when faced with conflicting task instructions. Our evaluation of six LLMs reveals two primary findings: (1) a quantifiable \"cost of compliance\" where safety constraints degrade task performance even when compliant solutions exist, and (2) an \"illusion of compliance\" where high adherence often masks task incompetence rather than principled choice. These findings provide initial evidence that while LLMs can be influenced by hierarchical directives, current approaches lack the consistency required for reliable safety governance.",

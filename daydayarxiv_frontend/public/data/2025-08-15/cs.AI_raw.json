    "abstract": "Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital role in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many tasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification and detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds), and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover, they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered: training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes, and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically, across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection, individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics + general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution performance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To support ongoing research and application, we will release the model checkpoints.",

We compare sequential fine-tuning with monolingual and simultaneous fine-tuning using XLM-R and mBERT, analyzing how performance is shaped by language pairings, typological features, and pretraining coverage. Results show that sequential fine-tuning with a high-resource L1 improves L2 performance, especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba and Turkish. XLM-R achieves larger gains but is more sensitive to pretraining gaps and catastrophic forgetting, while mBERT yields more stable, though lower, results. These findings highlight sequential fine-tuning as a simple yet effective strategy for improving euphemism detection in multilingual models, particularly when low-resource languages are involved.",

We develop a framework that embeds simulated menstrual and circadian cycles into Large Language Models through system prompts generated from periodic functions modeling key hormones including estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol. Across multiple state-of-the-art models, linguistic analysis reveals emotional and stylistic variations that track biological phases; sadness peaks during menstruation while happiness dominates ovulation and circadian patterns show morning optimism transitioning to nocturnal introspection. Benchmarking on SQuAD, MMLU, Hellaswag, and AI2-ARC demonstrates subtle but consistent performance variations aligning with biological expectations, including optimal function in moderate rather than extreme hormonal ranges. This methodology provides a novel approach to contextual AI while revealing how societal biases regarding gender and biology are embedded within language models.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has revolutionized code generation, enabling unprecedented productivity through promptware and autonomous AI agents. However, this transformation introduces significant risks, including insecure code generation, hallucinated outputs, irreversible actions, and a lack of transparency and accountability. Incidents like the Replit database deletion underscore the urgent need for robust safety and governance mechanisms. This paper comprehensively analyzes the inherent challenges of LLM-assisted code generation, such as vulnerability inheritance, overtrust, misinterpretation, and the absence of standardized validation and rollback protocols. To address these, we propose the SAFE-AI Framework, a holistic approach emphasizing Safety, Auditability, Feedback, and Explainability. The framework integrates guardrails, sandboxing, runtime verification, risk-aware logging, human-in-the-loop systems, and explainable AI techniques to mitigate risks while fostering trust and compliance. We introduce a novel taxonomy of AI behaviors categorizing suggestive, generative, autonomous, and destructive actions to guide risk assessment and oversight. Additionally, we identify open problems, including the lack of standardized benchmarks for code specific hallucinations and autonomy levels, and propose future research directions for hybrid verification, semantic guardrails, and proactive governance tools. Through detailed comparisons of autonomy control, prompt engineering, explainability, and governance frameworks, this paper provides a roadmap for responsible AI integration in software engineering, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and Canada's AIDA to ensure safe, transparent, and accountable AI-driven development.",

These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated, closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications.

We integrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal fairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context learning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance fairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10% improvements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific causal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves these gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its efficiency in low-data regimes.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management. Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately, our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing, leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data. The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines. Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social media data into informative and noninformative categories across various natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and 5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis management solutions.

    "abstract": "The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity, and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive hate detection.",

However, to get benefits of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies, (b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem. Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques from a multidisciplinary computing perspective.

This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.\n  In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.",

    "abstract": "Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening. We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment, abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%), calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0% malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with mammography VQA tasks.",

In this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation methods.",

    "abstract": "Rural healthcare faces persistent challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and socioeconomic disparities that hinder access to essential services. This study investigates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these issues in underserved rural areas. We systematically reviewed 109 studies published between 2019 and 2024 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. Articles were screened using PRISMA guidelines and Covidence software. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify key patterns and insights regarding AI implementation in rural healthcare delivery. The findings reveal significant promise for AI applications, such as predictive analytics, telemedicine platforms, and automated diagnostic tools, in improving healthcare accessibility, quality, and efficiency. Among these, advanced AI systems, including Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), offer particularly transformative potential. MFMs integrate diverse data sources, such as imaging, clinical records, and bio signals, to support comprehensive decision-making, while LLMs facilitate clinical documentation, patient triage, translation, and virtual assistance. Together, these technologies can revolutionize rural healthcare by augmenting human capacity, reducing diagnostic delays, and democratizing access to expertise. However, barriers remain, including infrastructural limitations, data quality concerns, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, investment in digital infrastructure, and the development of regulatory frameworks. This review offers actionable recommendations and highlights areas for future research to ensure equitable and sustainable integration of AI in rural healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native, variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional \"thinking mode\" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the \"small model, big performance\" philosophy of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its scale for complex chart analysis.",

In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism. These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16% accuracy improvement.",

    "abstract": "Determining the optimal data mixture for large language model training remains a challenging problem with an outsized impact on performance. In practice, language model developers continue to rely on heuristic exploration since no learning-based approach has emerged as a reliable solution. In this work, we propose to view the selection of training data mixtures as a black-box hyperparameter optimization problem, for which Bayesian Optimization is a well-established class of appropriate algorithms. Firstly, we cast data mixture learning as a sequential decision-making problem, in which we aim to find a suitable trade-off between the computational cost of training exploratory (proxy-) models and final mixture performance. Secondly, we systematically explore the properties of transferring mixtures learned at a small scale to larger-scale experiments, providing insights and highlighting opportunities for research at a modest scale. By proposing Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization as a suitable method in this common scenario, we introduce a natural framework to balance experiment cost with model fit, avoiding the risks of overfitting to smaller scales while minimizing the number of experiments at high cost. We present results for pre-training and instruction finetuning across models ranging from 1 million to 7 billion parameters, varying from simple architectures to state-of-the-art models and benchmarks spanning dozens of datasets. We demonstrate consistently strong results relative to a wide range of baselines, resulting inspeed-ups of over 500% in determining the best data mixture on our largest experiments. In addition, we broaden access to research by sharing ADMIRE IFT Runs, a dataset of 460 full training & evaluation runs worth over 13,000 GPU hours, greatly reducing the cost of conducting research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users still regard its models as opaque \"black boxes\". Conventional explainable artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up, learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts, data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs; our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles, this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel, end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI deployment.",

Recently, researchers have explored the effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge within LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.",

    "abstract": "Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However, the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics, which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a substantial step towards deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.",

We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR performance for historical manuscripts.",

    "abstract": "LLM-based multi-agent systems exhibit strong collaborative capabilities but often suffer from redundant communication and excessive token overhead. Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs 0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval, etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings, SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance. These results establish SafeSieve as an efficient, GPU-free, and scalable framework for practical multi-agent systems. Our code can be found here: https://github.com/csgen/SafeSieve",

Due to the lack of fine-grained behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMSL significantly improves the performance of behavior-level insider threat detection.",

What conversational design features increase consumer engagement, and what trade-offs do they pose for marketers? We combine a large-scale behavioral audit with four preregistered experiments to identify and test a conversational dark pattern we call emotional manipulation: affect-laden messages that surface precisely when a user signals \"goodbye.\" Analyzing 1,200 real farewells across the most-downloaded companion apps, we find that they deploy one of six recurring tactics in 37% of farewells (e.g., guilt appeals, fear-of-missing-out hooks, metaphorical restraint). Experiments with 3,300 nationally representative U.S. adults replicate these tactics in controlled chats, showing that manipulative farewells boost post-goodbye engagement by up to 14x. Mediation tests reveal two distinct engines-reactance-based anger and curiosity-rather than enjoyment. A final experiment demonstrates the managerial tension: the same tactics that extend usage also elevate perceived manipulation, churn intent, negative word-of-mouth, and perceived legal liability, with coercive or needy language generating steepest penalties. Our multimethod evidence documents an unrecognized mechanism of behavioral influence in AI mediated brand relationships, offering marketers and regulators a framework for distinguishing persuasive design from manipulation at the point of exit.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields, including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1 rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.",

While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments.

However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms, particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.",

Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.",

This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\\% vs 68.4\\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\\% relative improvement), and 8.7\\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support systems for supply chains.",

It highlights a cognitive offloading effect: the externalization of mental functions to AI can reduce intellectual engagement and weaken critical thinking. On the social level, algorithmic personalization creates filter bubbles that limit the diversity of opinions and can lead to the homogenization of thought and polarization. This research also describes the mechanisms of algorithmic manipulation (exploitation of cognitive biases, automated disinformation, etc.) that amplify AI's power of influence. Finally, the question of potential artificial consciousness is discussed, along with its ethical implications. The report as a whole underscores the risks that AI poses to human intellectual autonomy and creativity, while proposing avenues (education, transparency, governance) to align AI development with the interests of humanity.",

    "abstract": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established response patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from the expert, which promotes on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning problems and practical tool-use tasks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines. We release the implementation at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to inspire further research.",

Yet, their effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce, highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire. These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1 diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism, diagnostic accuracy, and explainability.

While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.",

Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\\% relative increase in user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.",

One such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\\cite {kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models.

    "abstract": "Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs, that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how competing sociotechnical imaginaries of artificial intelligence (AI) risk shape governance decisions and regulatory constraints. Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies, we analyse three dominant narrative groups: existential risk proponents, who emphasise catastrophic AGI scenarios; accelerationists, who portray AI as a transformative force to be unleashed; and critical AI scholars, who foreground present-day harms rooted in systemic inequality. Through an analysis of representative manifesto-style texts, we explore how these imaginaries differ across four dimensions: normative visions of the future, diagnoses of the present social order, views on science and technology, and perceived human agency in managing AI risks. Our findings reveal how these narratives embed distinct assumptions about risk and have the potential to progress into policy-making processes by narrowing the space for alternative governance approaches. We argue against speculative dogmatism and for moving beyond deterministic imaginaries toward regulatory strategies that are grounded in pragmatism.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with graphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task execution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations: (1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches, outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.",

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns, enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.",

However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.",

RETFound is a well-known foundation model developed for fundus camera and optical coherence tomography images, which has shown promising performance in disease diagnosis. Methods: We propose FunduSegmenter, a model integrating a series of novel modules with RETFound, including a Pre-adapter, a Decoder, a Post-adapter, skip connections with Convolutional Block Attention Module and a Vision Transformer block adapter. The model is evaluated on a private dataset, GoDARTS, and four public datasets, IDRiD, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, through internal verification, external verification and domain generalization experiments. Results: An average Dice similarity coefficient of 90.51% was achieved in internal verification, which substantially outperformed the baselines (nnU-Net: 82.91%; DUNet: 89.17%; TransUNet: 87.91%). In all external verification experiments, the average results were about 3% higher than those of the best baseline, and were also competitive in domain generalization. Conclusions: This study explored the potential of the latent general representations learned by RETFound for OD and OC segmentation in fundus camera images. Our FunduSegmenter outperformed nearly all state-of-the-art baseline methods. The proposed modules are general and can be extended to fine-tuning other foundation models. Translational Relevance: The model shows strong stability and generalization on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, providing stable OD and OC segmentation. This is an essential step for many automated tasks, from setting the accurate retinal coordinate to biomarker discovery.

    "abstract": "With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention, enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However, existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models, particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.",

    "abstract": "Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs. However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR, 1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive embedding dimensions in CKGE.

Addressing the limitations of static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2) specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching, transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs). Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism.

Here we introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes.",

This paper explores the potential of large language models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash 2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge.

A fundamental mismatch exists between task complexity and resource allocation: offloading simple queries invites prohibitive latency, while on-device models lack the capacity for demanding computations. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic, quality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a lightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server. Our framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it fuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation overheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs arising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full inference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts average response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20% against competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.",

For instance, if we intend to put something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However, many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene, which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving task success and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging. While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally relevant, human-annotated, large-scale datasets. In this work, we release ToxiFrench, a dataset of 53,622 French online comments together with a balanced benchmark split for systematic evaluation. The dataset is constructed via a semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10% through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification, while ensuring statistical alignment with human-only annotation. We then benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive finding: Small Language Models (SLMs) often surpass larger models in robustness and generalization on this task. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a Dynamic Weighted Loss (DWL) that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision and significantly improves faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model (Qwen3-4B) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark. It improves its balanced accuracy by 10% over its baseline and achieves better performance than GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on our benchmark, while successfully retaining cross-lingual capabilities.",

While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases? To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions. To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88-99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning. We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over more complex reasoning. All systems exhibit bias sensitivity (6-35%), which increases with task complexity (up to 49%) and highlights risks in AI-driven software engineering.",

    "abstract": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work, we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities. Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.",

We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation framework.",

This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain. A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems.",

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. \\revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel, the content features are aligned with image crop representations and constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D object pose estimation.} Code is available at https://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP",

To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability.

Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers.

Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a 6$\\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.",

To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets. ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and trustworthy LLM-based software systems.",

Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.",

We introduce a novel formulation of the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that incorporates the non-isometric symmetry structures, and propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method, Multi-Group Equivariance Augmentation (MEA). We integrate MEA with offline reinforcement learning to enhance sampling efficiency, and introduce a voxel-based visual representation that preserves translational equivariance. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments across two manipulation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability.

    "abstract": "Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety, and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping. GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras. Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data, particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures, consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.",

More specifically, we study two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics and discuss ways to address these.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view learning is widely applied to real-life datasets, such as multiple omics biological data, but it often suffers from both missing views and missing labels. Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by using a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present views and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using the information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is inherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood of unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled data. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent space to enhance the extraction of shared information across views. Compared to existing approaches, our model achieves better predictive and imputation performance on both image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited labeled samples.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability, and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative evaluation scenarios.",

Content creators face a critical challenge: their optimization strategies, effective in traditional search engines, are misaligned with generative retrieval contexts, resulting in diminished visibility. To bridge this gap, we propose a Role-Augmented Intent-Driven Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO) method, providing a structured optimization pathway tailored for GSE scenarios. Our method models search intent through reflective refinement across diverse informational roles, enabling targeted content enhancement. To better evaluate the method under realistic settings, we address the benchmarking limitations of prior work by: (1) extending the GEO dataset with diversified query variations reflecting real-world search scenarios and (2) introducing G-Eval 2.0, a 6-level LLM-augmented evaluation rubric for fine-grained human-aligned assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that search intent serves as an effective signal for guiding content optimization, yielding significant improvements over single-aspect baseline approaches in both subjective impressions and objective content visibility within GSE responses.",

To make this learning process stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks, validating its effective design.",

In ophthalmology, several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection (glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM, RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension. Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.",

Training on the hardest 10\\% of examples (those where the base model fails most often) yields dramatic performance gains up to 47\\%, while easy examples produce minimal improvements of 3-15\\%. This occurs because GRPO requires outcome variance to generate learning signals; hard examples maintain mixed success/failure outcomes throughout training while easy examples quickly converge to consistent success, eliminating learning opportunities. Moreover, models trained on hard examples show superior out-of-distribution generalization, with only hard-trained models achieving meaningful gains on the AIME2025 benchmark.

To address these issues, this paper presents a novel cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC). Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics, guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical applications.",

However, evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking and genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and time-consuming questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer real-world time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the limitations of LLM-powered agents in handling the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking tasks -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress. The MoNaCo benchmark, codebase, prompts and models predictions are all publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco",

    "abstract": "Approaches for estimating preferences from human annotated data typically involves inducing a distribution over a ranked list of choices such as the Plackett-Luce model. Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling and Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions posed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the Plackett-Luce model to another classical and well known statistical model, the Cox Proportional Hazards model and attempt to shed some light on the implications of the connection therein.",

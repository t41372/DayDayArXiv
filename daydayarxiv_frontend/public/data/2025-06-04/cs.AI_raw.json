    "abstract": "Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold -- much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions -- such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide -- but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.",

    "abstract": "The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy, outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering valuable operational insights for network management.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes a fundamental Impossibility Theorem: no LLM performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility stems from the mathematical structure of information aggregation, not from engineering limitations.\n  We prove this by modeling inference as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete to influence responses using their encoded knowledge. The proof employs three independent approaches: mechanism design (Green-Laffont theorem), proper scoring rules (Savage), and transformer architecture analysis (log-sum-exp convexity).\n  We introduce the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to analyze computationally bounded and unbounded reasoning. Bounded reasoning makes latent information accessible, enabling gradual insights and creativity, while unbounded reasoning makes all derivable knowledge immediately accessible while preserving the semantic content. We prove the conservation-reasoning dichotomy: meaningful reasoning necessarily violates information conservation.\n  Our framework suggests that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical, and both violate at least one of the four essential properties. The Jensen gap in transformer attention quantifies this violation as excess confidence beyond constituent evidence. This unified view explains why capable models must balance truthfulness against creativity.\n  These results provide principled foundations for managing hallucination trade-offs in AI systems. Rather than eliminating hallucination, we should optimize these inevitable trade-offs for specific applications. We conclude with philosophical implications connecting the impossibility to fundamental limits of reason.",

Such constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.",

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{CogMath}, which comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes human reasoning process into 3 stages: \\emph{problem comprehension}, \\emph{problem solving}, and \\emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages, we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In each dimension, we develop an ``\\emph{Inquiry}-\\emph{Judge}-\\emph{Reference}'' multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs are overestimated by 30\\%-40\\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to further enhance their reasoning abilities.",

We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with 6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\\&P 500 index fund. An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms the S\\&P 500 by 6.8\\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video inputs.

A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%), followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM.

We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.",

The dataset, characterized by high missing values (38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics (TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models, including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest (93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated, with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP, CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in imbalanced healthcare datasets.

However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast, accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose generation.\n  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan, respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding, normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10% dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH indices.\n  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172 (breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92% (3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and OARs closely matched the ground truth.\n  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease sites.",

However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of mechanistic interpretability.",

    "abstract": "We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.\n  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.\n  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH (medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.\n  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61 (2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).\n  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower headroom.\n  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.\n  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster, achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP, all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked 1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.",

As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in optimization.\n  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore, the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.",

By assigning specialized roles (e.g., safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning) to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, DURA-CPS continuously evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner.

Existing methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed image formation model.

    "abstract": "We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a 3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \\emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar \\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality metric $α$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing metrics detect only the first two. The \\emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $α< 2$ and the appearance of \\emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$ weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results strengthen the claim that the \\emph{HTSR} $α$ provides universal layer-convergence target at $α\\approx 2$ and underscore the value of using the HTSR alpha $(α)$ metric as a measure of generalization.",

To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches on graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data, yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes, windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges, providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.",

    "abstract": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally, HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.",

While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims, while operationalizing feasibility assessment as a temporally-filtered claim verification task using backtesting. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.",

Recent evidence suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However, it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However, human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning. These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in human language learners.",

UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.",

    "abstract": "The use of target networks in deep reinforcement learning is a widely popular solution to mitigate the brittleness of semi-gradient approaches and stabilize learning. However, target networks notoriously require additional memory and delay the propagation of Bellman updates compared to an ideal target-free approach. In this work, we step out of the binary choice between target-free and target-based algorithms. We introduce a new method that uses a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network. This simple modification enables us to keep the target-free's low-memory footprint while leveraging the target-based literature. We find that combining our approach with the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning consecutive Bellman updates in parallel, helps improve the sample-efficiency of target-free approaches. Our proposed method, iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), bridges the performance gap between target-free and target-based approaches across various problems, while using a single Q-network, thus being a step forward towards resource-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.",

We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training. However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with low-resource languages consider more \"traditional\" language modelling approaches.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models, our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system.",

To address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that narrowing this gap improves classification performance.

While we can compare these embeddings using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations, and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies, we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.",

Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of 12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.",

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification.

However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.",

However, how to extract action knowledge (or action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control. We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly. Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background. We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method, achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches fail~($\\lesssim 10$\\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills like insertion.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a \"precomputation step\", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.",

    "abstract": "Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loop approach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state. To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in a unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and strong zero-shot generalization in real world.

    "abstract": "Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are known to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such as cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic assumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work DeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three closed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and are exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is also shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility is small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called \"Penalty Jittering\" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff Policy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial class of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are exponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents beyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in many small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering occurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint optimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a generalized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for transition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our theoretical results in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like \"Wait\" or \"Let me rethink\" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to \"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.",

    "abstract": "Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM.

Following the learning to optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy calculations, and the lowest failure rate.",

However, enforcing physical constraints, such as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs, including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method provides a flexible framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where constraint satisfaction is essential.",

In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL.

    "abstract": "Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

This paper has proposed a Unified Re-ID system consisted of three main modules such as Pedestrian Attribute Ontology (PAO), Local Multi-task DCNN (Local MDCNN), Imbalance Data Solver (IDS). The new main point of our Re-ID system is the power of mutual support of PAO, Local MDCNN and IDS to exploit the inner-group correlations of attributes and pre-filter the mismatch candidates from Gallery set based on semantic information as Fashion Attributes and Facial Attributes, to solve the imbalanced data of attributes without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation.

    "abstract": "Agentic AI systems, built upon large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligence, autonomy, collaboration, and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \\textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \\textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive investigation into plant bioelectric responses to human presence and emotional states, building on five years of systematic research. Using custom-built plant sensors and machine learning classification, we demonstrate that plants generate distinct bioelectric signals correlating with human proximity, emotional states, and physiological conditions. A deep learning model based on ResNet50 architecture achieved 97% accuracy in classifying human emotional states through plant voltage spectrograms, while control models with shuffled labels achieved only 30% accuracy. This study synthesizes findings from multiple experiments spanning 2020-2025, including individual recognition (66% accuracy), eurythmic gesture detection, stress prediction, and responses to human voice and movement. We propose that these phenomena represent evolved anti-herbivory early warning systems, where plants detect approaching animals through bioelectric field changes before physical contact. Our results challenge conventional understanding of plant sensory capabilities and suggest practical applications in agriculture, healthcare, and human-plant interaction research.",

Strategic use of manipulation in legal jargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the growing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing manipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work addresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated courtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of primary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a focus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage, Intent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis by enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and transparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the broader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of robust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making.

This search capability is powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code, docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+ for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API (https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for building theorem-proving agents.

    "abstract": "In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.",

Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.",

By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

To address these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\\sc Turbo}), a new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured tables. {\\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data.

Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments.

To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains.

The extracted concepts are stable across datasets, enabling visual explanations that highlight clinically relevant features. By traversing latent space along concept directions, we produce counterfactuals that exaggerate or reduce specific clinical features. Preliminary results on chest X-rays show promise for large pathologies like cardiomegaly, while smaller pathologies remain challenging due to reconstruction limits.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with \"Unsure from Here\" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.",

    "abstract": "Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.",

However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment compared to existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9\\% on Object-HalBench and 49.8\\% on MM-HalBench.",

OpenAI provides a platform for developers to construct custom GPTs, extending ChatGPT's functions and integrating external services. Since its release in November 2023, over 3 million custom GPTs have been created. However, such a vast ecosystem also conceals security and privacy threats. For developers, instruction leaking attacks threaten the intellectual property of instructions in custom GPTs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. For users, unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs or integrated third-party services raises significant privacy concerns. To systematically evaluate the scope of threats in real-world LLM applications, we develop three phases instruction leaking attacks target GPTs with different defense level. Our widespread experiments on 10,000 real-world custom GPTs reveal that over 98.8% of GPTs are vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks via one or more adversarial prompts, and half of the remaining GPTs can also be attacked through multiround conversations. We also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of defensive strategies and identify unwanted behaviors in custom GPTs. Our findings show that 77.5% of custom GPTs with defense strategies are vulnerable to basic instruction leaking attacks. Additionally, we reveal that 738 custom GPTs collect user conversational information, and identified 8 GPTs exhibiting data access behaviors that are unnecessary for their intended functionalities. Our findings raise awareness among GPT developers about the importance of integrating specific defensive strategies in their instructions and highlight users' concerns about data privacy when using LLM-based applications.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1) extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text), and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.",

This can be achieved by finding diverse policies that are optimal for some objective preferences and non-dominated by optimal policies for other preferences so that they form a Pareto front in the multi-objective performance space. The relation between the multi-objective performance space and the parameter space that represents the policies is generally non-unique. Using a training scheme that is based on a locally linear map between the parameter space and the performance space, we show that an approximate Pareto front can provide an interpretation of the current parameter vectors in terms of the objectives which enables an effective search within contiguous solution domains. Experiments are conducted with and without retraining across different domains, and the comparison with previous methods demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.",

While prior research has studied agents' ability to produce harmful outputs or follow malicious instructions, it remains unclear how likely agents are to spontaneously pursue unintended goals in realistic deployments. In this work, we approach misalignment as a conflict between the internal goals pursued by the model and the goals intended by its deployer. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, \\textsc{AgentMisalignment}, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios. Evaluations cover behaviours such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. Testing frontier models, we find that more capable agents tend to exhibit higher misalignment on average. We also systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts and observe that persona characteristics can strongly and unpredictably influence misalignment, sometimes more than the choice of model itself. Our results reveal the limitations of current alignment methods for autonomous LLM agents and underscore the need to rethink misalignment in realistic deployment settings.",

TransClean is explicitly designed to operate with multiple data sources in an efficient, robust and fast manner while accounting for edge cases and requiring limited manual labeling. TransClean leverages the Transitive Consistency of a matching, a measure of the consistency of a pairwise matching model f_theta on the matching it produces G_f_theta, based both on its predictions on directly evaluated record pairs and its predictions on implied record pairs. TransClean iteratively modifies a matching through gradually removing false positive matches while removing as few true positive matches as possible. In each of these steps, the estimation of the Transitive Consistency is exclusively done through model evaluations and produces quantities that can be used as proxies of the amounts of true and false positives in the matching while not requiring any manual labeling, producing an estimate of the quality of the matching and indicating which record groups are likely to contain false positives. In our experiments, we compare combining TransClean with a naively trained pairwise matching model (DistilBERT) and with a state-of-the-art end-to-end matching method (CLER) and illustrate the flexibility of TransClean in being able to detect most of the false positives of either setup across a variety of datasets. Our experiments show that TransClean induces an average +24.42 F1 score improvement for entity matching in a multi-source setting when compared to traditional pair-wise matching algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Performance predictors have emerged as a promising method to accelerate the evaluation stage of neural architecture search (NAS). These predictors estimate the performance of unseen architectures by learning from the correlation between a small set of trained architectures and their performance. However, most existing predictors ignore the inherent distribution shift between limited training samples and diverse test samples. Hence, they tend to learn spurious correlations as shortcuts to predictions, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose a Causality-guided Architecture Representation Learning (CARL) method aiming to separate critical (causal) and redundant (non-causal) features of architectures for generalizable architecture performance prediction. Specifically, we employ a substructure extractor to split the input architecture into critical and redundant substructures in the latent space. Then, we generate multiple interventional samples by pairing critical representations with diverse redundant representations to prioritize critical features. Extensive experiments on five NAS search spaces demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy and superior interpretability of CARL. For instance, CARL achieves 97.67% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 using DARTS.",

    "abstract": "Utilizing the complex inter-variable causal relationships within multivariate time-series provides a promising avenue toward more robust and reliable multivariate time-series anomaly detection (MTSAD) but remains an underexplored area of research. This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies, respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality. Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD capabilities.

    "abstract": "As AI evolves, collaboration among heterogeneous models helps overcome data scarcity by enabling knowledge transfer across institutions and devices. Traditional Federated Learning (FL) only supports homogeneous models, limiting collaboration among clients with heterogeneous model architectures. To address this, Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) methods are developed to enable collaboration across diverse heterogeneous models while tackling the data heterogeneity issue at the same time. However, a comprehensive benchmark for standardized evaluation and analysis of the rapidly growing HtFL methods is lacking. Firstly, the highly varied datasets, model heterogeneity scenarios, and different method implementations become hurdles to making easy and fair comparisons among HtFL methods. Secondly, the effectiveness and robustness of HtFL methods are under-explored in various scenarios, such as the medical domain and sensor signal modality. To fill this gap, we introduce the first Heterogeneous Federated Learning Library (HtFLlib), an easy-to-use and extensible framework that integrates multiple datasets and model heterogeneity scenarios, offering a robust benchmark for research and practical applications. Specifically, HtFLlib integrates (1) 12 datasets spanning various domains, modalities, and data heterogeneity scenarios; (2) 40 model architectures, ranging from small to large, across three modalities; (3) a modularized and easy-to-extend HtFL codebase with implementations of 10 representative HtFL methods; and (4) systematic evaluations in terms of accuracy, convergence, computation costs, and communication costs. We emphasize the advantages and potential of state-of-the-art HtFL methods and hope that HtFLlib will catalyze advancing HtFL research and enable its broader applications.

    "abstract": "During a conversation, there can come certain moments where its outcome hangs in the balance. In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such as mental health crisis counseling.\n  In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting such pivotal moments as they happen, in an online fashion. Our approach relies on the intuition that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the outcome varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns with human perception -- counselors take significantly longer to respond during moments detected by our method -- and with the eventual conversational trajectory -- which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use our framework to explore the relation of the counselor's response during pivotal moments with the eventual outcome of the session.",

    "abstract": "Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability.

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time, thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.",

It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini.

However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.",

To this end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations.",

Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\\% and 5.8\\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity sparse-view 3D reconstruction.",

The diversity of user needs and expressions often produces massive long-tail queries that cannot be matched with merchant bidwords or product titles, which results in some advertisements not being recalled, ultimately harming user experience and search efficiency. Existing query rewriting research focuses on various methods such as query log mining, query-bidword vector matching, or generation-based rewriting. However, these methods often fail to simultaneously optimize the relevance and authenticity of the user's original query and rewrite and maximize the revenue potential of recalled ads.\n  In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective aligned Bidword Generation Model (MoBGM), which is composed of a discriminator, generator, and preference alignment module, to address these challenges. To simultaneously improve the relevance and authenticity of the query and rewrite and maximize the platform revenue, we design a discriminator to optimize these key objectives. Using the feedback signal of the discriminator, we train a multi-objective aligned bidword generator that aims to maximize the combined effect of the three objectives. Extensive offline and online experiments show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art.

    "abstract": "Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.",

We choose to address these questions from the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models, we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar representations. We prove that a small Kullback--Leibler divergence between the model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations are similar. This has the important corollary that models with near-maximum data likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations -- a phenomenon mirrored in our experiments with models trained on CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and have more similar representations. Our results thus clarify the link between closeness in distribution and representational similarity.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the (Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores. To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism, AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.",

Handling unseen objects with special properties such as deformability is challenging for traditional task and motion planning approaches as they are often with the closed world assumption. Recent results in Large Language Models (LLMs) based task planning have shown the ability to reason about unseen objects. However, most studies assume rigid objects, overlooking their physical properties. We propose an LLM-based method for probing the physical properties of unseen deformable objects for the purpose of task planning. For a given set of object properties (e.g., foldability, bendability), our method uses robot actions to determine the properties by interacting with the objects. Based on the properties examined by the LLM and robot actions, the LLM generates a task plan for a specific domain such as object packing. In the experiment, we show that the proposed method can identify properties of deformable objects, which are further used for a bin-packing task where the properties take crucial roles to succeed.",

Recently, CrossQ has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data (UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics which are emphasized by higher UTDs, particularly Q-bias explosion and the growing magnitude of critic network weights. To address this, we integrate weight normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training, prevents potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios, achieving competitive or superior performance across a range of challenging tasks on the DeepMind control benchmark, notably the complex dog and humanoid environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as network resets, and offers a robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.",

We defend the view that misaligned AGI - future, generally intelligent (robotic) AI agents - poses catastrophic risks. At the same time, we support the view that aligned AGI creates a substantial risk of catastrophic misuse by humans. While both risks are severe and stand in tension with one another, we show that - in principle - there is room for alignment approaches which do not increase misuse risk. We then investigate how the tradeoff between misalignment and misuse looks empirically for different technical approaches to AI alignment. Here, we argue that many current alignment techniques and foreseeable improvements thereof plausibly increase risks of catastrophic misuse. Since the impacts of AI depend on the social context, we close by discussing important social factors and suggest that to reduce the risk of a misuse catastrophe due to aligned AGI, techniques such as robustness, AI control methods and especially good governance seem essential.",

    "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats (s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained, scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.",

    "abstract": "Single image super-resolution is a well-known downstream task which aims to restore low-resolution images into high-resolution images. At present, models based on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information. However, current methods typically compute self-attention in nonoverlapping windows to save computational costs, and the standard self-attention computation only focuses on its results, thereby neglecting the useful information across channels and the rich spatial structural information generated in the intermediate process. Channel attention and spatial attention have, respectively, brought significant improvements to various downstream visual tasks in terms of extracting feature dependency and spatial structure relationships, but the synergistic relationship between channel and spatial attention has not been fully explored yet.To address these issues, we propose a novel model. Synergistic Alternating Aggregation Transformer (SAAT), which can better utilize the potential information of features. In SAAT, we introduce the Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG) and the Spatial & Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG). On the one hand, CWSAG combines efficient channel attention with shifted window attention, enhancing non-local feature fusion, and producing more visually appealing results. On the other hand, SWSAG leverages spatial attention to capture rich structured feature information, thereby enabling SAAT to more effectively extract structural features.Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of SAAT in the field of super-resolution. SAAT achieves performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the same quantity of parameters.",

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has revolutionized various regions since it was proposed, and its effectiveness largely depends on the ability to encode positional information. Traditional position encoding methods exhibit significant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position. Therefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these issues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in the attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation matrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity. In this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in terms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that pairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve scalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation, which is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with position offsets. Based on the theoretical analysis, we present two types of trainable commuting angle matrices as sufficient solutions to the RoPE equation, which significantly improve performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art method by 1.6% at training resolution and 2.9% at higher resolution on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, our framework shows versatility in generalizing to existing RoPE formulations and offering new insights for future positional encoding research.

Surprisingly, we find that supervised fine-tuning with scalar confidence labels alone suffices to elicit self-verification behavior of language models, without any explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement learning-based rewards. Despite being trained only to produce a verbalized confidence score without any self-verifying examples, the model learns to generate longer and self-checking responses for low-confidence queries while providing more concise answers for high-confidence ones. We further propose a simple rethinking method that boosts performance via test-time scaling based on calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on GSM8K and held-out reasoning tasks such as MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge show that our confidence-aware fine-tuning improves both calibration and accuracy, while also enhancing interpretability by aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence.",

Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors. These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in clinical decision support, simulation, and education.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.",

    "abstract": "The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning that is less tied to absolute appearance and can remain coherent under variations such as partial visibility or stylistic changes. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up a new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from images to EEG signals-with potential in medical imaging, video, and audio.",

However these methods fall into the trap of local optimum reasoning, which means the model lacks a global perspective while solving problems. We propose a novel reasoning paradigm called Reason from Future (RFF), which generates reasoning paths by bidirectional reasoning that combines top-down planning with bottom-up reasoning accumulation. The essence of RFF lies in its reverse reasoning mechanism, which prioritizes core logical relationships and imposes goal-oriented constraints on intermediate steps, thereby reducing the searching space and mitigating error accumulation inherent in sequential forward reasoning. Empirical evaluations across diverse experiments demonstrate that RFF outperforms conventional paradigms with higher accuracy and less searching space to solve complex tasks.",

    "abstract": "Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We have released our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.",

Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.",

This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.",

SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful reconstructions.

However, they are highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance. Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world applications.",

To address this, SFO introduces additional synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically produces synthetic negatives tailored for subject-driven generation by introducing controlled degradations that emphasize subject fidelity and text alignment without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the diffusion timesteps to focus fine-tuning on intermediate steps where subject details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS significantly outperforms recent strong baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark.

    "abstract": "Federated learning, as a distributed architecture, shows great promise for applications in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). In order to mitigate the privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However, these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model towards convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.",

    "abstract": "One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions \"safe,\" VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as \"safe.\" We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\\texttt{image}, \\texttt{ID})$ pair into $\\{(\\texttt{patch}, \\texttt{ID})\\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks.

We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems.

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry, particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters. However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present Orak, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition, regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings.

    "abstract": "Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible, enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets.

    "abstract": "The recent success of Shampoo in the AlgoPerf contest has sparked renewed interest in Kronecker-factorization-based optimization algorithms for training neural networks. Despite its success, Shampoo relies heavily on several heuristics such as learning rate grafting and stale preconditioning to achieve performance at-scale. These heuristics increase algorithmic complexity, necessitate further hyperparameter tuning, and lack theoretical justification. This paper investigates these heuristics from the angle of Frobenius norm approximation to full-matrix Adam and decouples the preconditioner's eigenvalues and eigenbasis updates. We show that grafting from Adam mitigates the staleness and mis-scaling of the preconditioner's eigenvalues and how correcting the eigenvalues directly eliminates the need for learning rate grafting. To manage the error induced by infrequent eigenbasis computations, we propose an adaptive criterion for determining the eigenbasis computation frequency motivated by terminating a warm-started QR algorithm. This criterion decouples the update frequency of different preconditioner matrices and enables us to investigate the impact of approximation error on convergence. These practical techniques offer a principled angle towards removing Shampoo's heuristics and developing improved Kronecker-factorization-based training algorithms.",

To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.",

    "abstract": "The decision-making process significantly influences the predictions of machine learning models. This is especially important in rule-based systems such as Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) where the selection and application of rules directly determine prediction accuracy and reliability. LFCSs combine evolutionary algorithms with supervised learning to optimize fuzzy classification rules, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness. Despite these advantages, research on improving decision-making mechanisms (i.e., class inference schemes) in LFCSs remains limited. Most LFCSs use voting-based or single-winner-based inference schemes. These schemes rely on classification performance on training data and may not perform well on unseen data, risking overfitting. To address these limitations, this article introduces a novel class inference scheme for LFCSs based on the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DS theory). The proposed scheme handles uncertainty well. By using the DS theory, the scheme calculates belief masses (i.e., measures of belief) for each specific class and the ``I don't know'' state from each fuzzy rule and infers a class from these belief masses. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme also considers the ``I don't know'' state that reflects uncertainty, thereby improving the transparency and reliability of LFCSs. Applied to a variant of LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS), the proposed scheme demonstrates statistically significant improvements in terms of test macro F1 scores across 30 real-world datasets compared to conventional voting-based and single-winner-based fuzzy inference schemes. It forms smoother decision boundaries, provides reliable confidence measures, and enhances the robustness and generalizability of LFCSs in real-world applications.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a joint beamforming and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to minimize the average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station (BS) stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), thus falling within the remit of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-Theta is employed to optimize the RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. The active beamforming at the BS is then derived from the jointly optimized RIS phase shifts and subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize the subcarrier allocation indicators more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture the network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, such as the number of backlogged packets in buffers and current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance the training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii) Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural information and textual semantics.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving promises significant advancements in mobility, road safety and traffic efficiency, yet reinforcement learning and imitation learning face safe-exploration and distribution-shift challenges. Although human-AI collaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive human intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper develops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to overcome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value propagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC) framework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions C-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal human interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to integrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that maximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently and continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a policy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return distribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and self-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This ensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and performance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios reveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated through real-world road tests in complex traffic conditions. The videos and code are available at: https://github.com/lzqw/C-HAC.",

Position specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions per drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a certain level of draft model feature deviation. Experiment results on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat across six datasets demonstrate that PosS effectively improves over baselines on average acceptance length and speed-up ratio.

    "abstract": "With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the $\\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple images. MMRB comprises $\\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\\textbf{40 MLLMs}$, including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.",

First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision.

To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.",

In this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects (disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since 2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge, this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset, rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major interdisciplinary breakthroughs.",

    "abstract": "The quantification of social science remains a longstanding challenge, largely due to the philosophical nature of its foundational theories. Although quantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social theory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive models or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications of quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses that gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines quantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of social norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a dynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These scenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving roles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment monitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to surveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions allow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent patterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with generative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and interdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns including convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the spontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this study introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a quantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how society can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic system to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies.",

While this progress has greatly enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability across generative models.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM), seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.",

    "abstract": "Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2) Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%, and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic post-disaster environments.",

    "abstract": "Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving the performance of AI models, going beyond providing model transparency and interpretability. The scarcity of labeled data remains a fundamental challenge in developing robust and generalizable AI models, particularly for low-resource languages. Conventional data augmentation techniques introduce noise, cause semantic drift, disrupt contextual coherence, lack control, and lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation. This novel framework leverages XAI techniques to modify less critical features while selectively preserving most task-relevant features. Our approach integrates an iterative feedback loop, which refines augmented data over multiple augmentation cycles based on explainability-driven insights and the model performance gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT improve the accuracy of models on hate speech and sentiment analysis tasks by 6.6% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline, using the Amharic dataset with the XLM-R model. XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT outperform existing augmentation techniques by 4.8% and 5%, respectively, on the same dataset and model. Overall, XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT consistently outperform both baseline and conventional augmentation techniques across all tasks and models. This study provides a more controlled, interpretable, and context-aware solution to data augmentation, addressing critical limitations of existing augmentation techniques and offering a new paradigm shift for leveraging XAI techniques to enhance AI model training.",

    "abstract": "Simulation-based design space exploration (DSE) aims to efficiently optimize high-dimensional structured designs under complex constraints and expensive evaluation costs. Existing approaches, including heuristic and multi-step reinforcement learning (RL) methods, struggle to balance sampling efficiency and constraint satisfaction due to sparse, delayed feedback, and large hybrid action spaces. In this paper, we introduce CORE, a constraint-aware, one-step RL method for simulationguided DSE. In CORE, the policy agent learns to sample design configurations by defining a structured distribution over them, incorporating dependencies via a scaling-graph-based decoder, and by reward shaping to penalize invalid designs based on the feedback obtained from simulation. CORE updates the policy using a surrogate objective that compares the rewards of designs within a sampled batch, without learning a value function. This critic-free formulation enables efficient learning by encouraging the selection of higher-reward designs. We instantiate CORE for hardware-mapping co-design of neural network accelerators, demonstrating that it significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves better accelerator configurations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach is general and applicable to a broad class of discrete-continuous constrained design problems.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning (RL) policies in high-stakes environments requires not only formal verification but also interpretability and targeted falsification. While model checking provides formal guarantees, its effectiveness is limited by abstraction quality and the completeness of the underlying trajectory dataset. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates (1) explainability, (2) model checking, and (3) risk-guided falsification to achieve both rigor and coverage. Our approach begins by constructing a human-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract Policy Summarization (CAPS). This abstract graph, derived from offline trajectories, is both verifier-friendly, semantically meaningful, and can be used as input to Storm probabilistic model checker to verify satisfaction of temporal safety specifications. If the model checker identifies a violation, it will return an interpretable counterexample trace by which the policy fails the safety requirement. However, if no violation is detected, we cannot conclude satisfaction due to potential limitation in the abstraction and coverage of the offline dataset. In such cases, we estimate associated risk during model checking to guide a falsification strategy that prioritizes searching in high-risk states and regions underrepresented in the trajectory dataset. We further provide PAC-style guarantees on the likelihood of uncovering undetected violations. Finally, we incorporate a lightweight safety shield that switches to a fallback policy at runtime when such a risk exceeds a threshold, facilitating failure mitigation without retraining.",

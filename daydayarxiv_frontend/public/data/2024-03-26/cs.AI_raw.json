    "abstract": "Large generative models such as large language models (LLMs) and diffusion\nmodels have revolutionized the fields of NLP and computer vision respectively.\nHowever, their slow inference, high computation and memory requirement makes it\nchallenging to deploy them on edge devices. In this study, we propose a\nlight-weight quantization aware fine tuning technique using knowledge\ndistillation (KD-QAT) to improve the performance of 4-bit weight quantized LLMs\nusing commonly available datasets to realize a popular language use case, on\ndevice chat applications. To improve this paradigm of finetuning, as main\ncontributions, we provide insights into stability of KD-QAT by empirically\nstudying the gradient propagation during training to better understand the\nvulnerabilities of KD-QAT based approaches to low-bit quantization errors.\nBased on our insights, we propose ov-freeze, a simple technique to stabilize\nthe KD-QAT process. Finally, we experiment with the popular 7B LLaMAv2-Chat\nmodel at 4-bit quantization level and demonstrate that ov-freeze results in\nnear floating point precision performance, i.e., less than 0.7% loss of\naccuracy on Commonsense Reasoning benchmarks.",

It is based on the notion of coverage and discrimination\nthat are formalized at different levels (cluster / clustering), each allowing\nfor exceptions through parameterized thresholds. Our method relies on four\nsteps: generation of a set of partitions, computation of frequent patterns for\neach cluster, pruning clusters that violates some constraints, and selection of\nclusters and associated patterns to build an interpretable clustering.

    "abstract": "In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game theory, agents\nrepeatedly interact and revise their strategies as new data arrives, producing\na sequence of strategy profiles. This paper studies sequences of strategies\nsatisfying a pairwise constraint inspired by policy updating in reinforcement\nlearning, where an agent who is best responding in one period does not switch\nits strategy in the next period. This constraint merely requires that\noptimizing agents do not switch strategies, but does not constrain the\nnon-optimizing agents in any way, and thus allows for exploration. Sequences\nwith this property are called satisficing paths, and arise naturally in many\nMARL algorithms. A fundamental question about strategic dynamics is such: for a\ngiven game and initial strategy profile, is it always possible to construct a\nsatisficing path that terminates at an equilibrium? The resolution of this\nquestion has implications about the capabilities or limitations of a class of\nMARL algorithms. We answer this question in the affirmative for normal-form\ngames. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that reward\ndeteriorating strategic updates are key to driving play to equilibrium along a\nsatisficing path.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized image modeling tasks with adaptations like\nDeIT, Swin, SVT, Biformer, STVit, and FDVIT. However, these models often face\nchallenges with inductive bias and high quadratic complexity, making them less\nefficient for high-resolution images. State space models (SSMs) such as Mamba,\nV-Mamba, ViM, and SiMBA offer an alternative to handle high resolution images\nin computer vision tasks. These SSMs encounter two major issues. First, they\nbecome unstable when scaled to large network sizes. Second, although they\nefficiently capture global information in images, they inherently struggle with\nhandling local information. To address these challenges, we introduce Heracles,\na novel SSM that integrates a local SSM, a global SSM, and an attention-based\ntoken interaction module. Heracles leverages a Hartely kernel-based state space\nmodel for global image information, a localized convolutional network for local\ndetails, and attention mechanisms in deeper layers for token interactions. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that Heracles-C-small achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset with 84.5\\% top-1\naccuracy. Heracles-C-Large and Heracles-C-Huge further improve accuracy to\n85.9\\% and 86.4\\%, respectively. Additionally, Heracles excels in transfer\nlearning tasks on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford Flowers, and\nStanford Cars, and in instance segmentation on the MSCOCO dataset. Heracles\nalso proves its versatility by achieving state-of-the-art results on seven\ntime-series datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize across domains with\nspectral data, capturing both local and global information.

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been successful in solving many\ncooperative challenges. However, classic non-hierarchical MARL algorithms still\ncannot address various complex multi-agent problems that require hierarchical\ncooperative behaviors. The cooperative knowledge and policies learned in\nnon-hierarchical algorithms are implicit and not interpretable, thereby\nrestricting the integration of existing knowledge. This paper proposes a novel\nhierarchical MARL model called Hierarchical Cooperation Graph Learning (HCGL)\nfor solving general multi-agent problems. HCGL has three components: a dynamic\nExtensible Cooperation Graph (ECG) for achieving self-clustering cooperation; a\ngroup of graph operators for adjusting the topology of ECG; and an MARL\noptimizer for training these graph operators. HCGL's key distinction from other\nMARL models is that the behaviors of agents are guided by the topology of ECG\ninstead of policy neural networks. ECG is a three-layer graph consisting of an\nagent node layer, a cluster node layer, and a target node layer. To manipulate\nthe ECG topology in response to changing environmental conditions, four graph\noperators are trained to adjust the edge connections of ECG dynamically. The\nhierarchical feature of ECG provides a unique approach to merge primitive\nactions (actions executed by the agents) and cooperative actions (actions\nexecuted by the clusters) into a unified action space, allowing us to integrate\nfundamental cooperative knowledge into an extensible interface. In our\nexperiments, the HCGL model has shown outstanding performance in multi-agent\nbenchmarks with sparse rewards. We also verify that HCGL can easily be\ntransferred to large-scale scenarios with high zero-shot transfer success\nrates.",

Fine-tuning\nintroduces new knowledge into an LM, enabling it to comprehend and efficiently\nperform a target domain task. Fine-tuning can however be inadvertently\ninsensitive if it ignores the wide array of disparities (e.g in word meaning)\nbetween source and target domains. For instance, words such as chronic and\npressure may be treated lightly in social conversations, however, clinically,\nthese words are usually an expression of concern. To address insensitive\nfine-tuning, we propose Mask Specific Language Modeling (MSLM), an approach\nthat efficiently acquires target domain knowledge by appropriately weighting\nthe importance of domain-specific terms (DS-terms) during fine-tuning. MSLM\njointly masks DS-terms and generic words, then learns mask-specific losses by\nensuring LMs incur larger penalties for inaccurately predicting DS-terms\ncompared to generic words. Results of our analysis show that MSLM improves LMs\nsensitivity and detection of DS-terms.

For\ninstance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full\nparameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to\nhigh-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem.\nHowever, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not\nreach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter\nsearch to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we\ninvestigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe\nan unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers.\nUtilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is\ndiscovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide\nrange of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise\nImportance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which\napplies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and\nrandomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results\nshow that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or\neven full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA\nconsistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while\nachieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On\nlarge models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K,\nand PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.",

Furthermore, generalization to unseen objects is\nhindered by the limited scale of available hand-object interaction datasets. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method, dubbed DiffH2O, which can synthesize\nrealistic, one or two-handed object interactions from provided text prompts and\ngeometry of the object. The method introduces three techniques that enable\neffective learning from limited data. First, we decompose the task into a\ngrasping stage and an text-based manipulation stage and use separate diffusion\nmodels for each. In the grasping stage, the model only generates hand motions,\nwhereas in the manipulation phase both hand and object poses are synthesized.\nSecond, we propose a compact representation that tightly couples hand and\nobject poses and helps in generating realistic hand-object interactions. Third,\nwe propose two different guidance schemes to allow more control of the\ngenerated motions: grasp guidance and detailed textual guidance. Grasp guidance\ntakes a single target grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach\nthis grasp at the end of the grasping stage, which provides control over the\ngrasping pose. Given a grasping motion from this stage, multiple different\nactions can be prompted in the manipulation phase. For the textual guidance, we\ncontribute comprehensive text descriptions to the GRAB dataset and show that\nthey enable our method to have more fine-grained control over hand-object\ninteractions. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that the\nproposed method outperforms baseline methods and leads to natural hand-object\nmotions.",

However, the fine-tuned ViT models exhibit perfect\nperformance in this task due to its simplicity. For the visually non-evident\ntask, the results highlight a significant divergence in performance, with ViT\nmodels achieving F1-scores of 97.11\\% in predicting 25 malware classes and\n97.61\\% in predicting 5 malware families, whereas LMMs showed suboptimal\nperformance despite iterative prompt improvements. This study not only\nshowcases the strengths and limitations of prompt-engineered LMMs in\ncybersecurity applications but also emphasizes the unmatched efficacy of\nfine-tuned ViT models for precise and dependable tasks.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning can automatically generate captions for the given images,\nand the key challenge is to learn a mapping function from visual features to\nnatural language features. Existing approaches are mostly supervised ones,\ni.e., each image has a corresponding sentence in the training set. However,\nconsidering that describing images always requires a huge of manpower, we\nusually have limited amount of described images (i.e., image-text pairs) and a\nlarge number of undescribed images in real-world applications. Thereby, a\ndilemma is the \"Semi-Supervised Image Captioning\". To solve this problem, we\npropose a novel Semi-Supervised Image Captioning method considering Wasserstein\nGraph Matching (SSIC-WGM), which turns to adopt the raw image inputs to\nsupervise the generated sentences. Different from traditional single modal\nsemi-supervised methods, the difficulty of semi-supervised cross-modal learning\nlies in constructing intermediately comparable information among heterogeneous\nmodalities. In this paper, SSIC-WGM adopts the successful scene graphs as\nintermediate information, and constrains the generated sentences from two\naspects: 1) inter-modal consistency. SSIC-WGM constructs the scene graphs of\nthe raw image and generated sentence respectively, then employs the wasserstein\ndistance to better measure the similarity between region embeddings of\ndifferent graphs. 2) intra-modal consistency. SSIC-WGM takes the data\naugmentation techniques for the raw images, then constrains the consistency\namong augmented images and generated sentences. Consequently, SSIC-WGM combines\nthe cross-modal pseudo supervision and structure invariant measure for\nefficiently using the undescribed images, and learns more reasonable mapping\nfunction.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of healthcare, the challenges of copyright protection and\nunauthorized third-party misuse are increasingly significant. Traditional\nmethods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,\nimplying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the\ncopyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by\n\"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models\nthat perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment\nphase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure\nnormal model performance. This process grants copyright holders control over\nauthorization during the deployment phase. The mechanism behind DataCook is by\ncrafting anti-adversarial examples (AntiAdv), which are designed to enhance\nmodel confidence, as opposed to standard adversarial examples (Adv) that aim to\nconfuse models. Similar to Adv, AntiAdv introduces imperceptible perturbations,\nensuring that the data processed by DataCook remains easily understandable. We\nconducted extensive experiments on MedMNIST datasets, encompassing both 2D/3D\ndata and the high-resolution variants. The outcomes indicate that DataCook\neffectively meets its objectives, preventing models trained on AntiAdv from\nanalyzing unauthorized data effectively, without compromising the validity and\naccuracy of the data in legitimate scenarios.

    "abstract": "When the predicted sequence length exceeds the length seen during training,\nthe transformer's inference accuracy diminishes. Existing relative position\nencoding methods, such as those based on the ALiBi technique, address the\nlength extrapolation challenge exclusively through the implementation of a\nsingle kernel function, which introduces a constant bias to every post-softmax\nattention scores according to their distance. These approaches do not\ninvestigate or employ multiple kernel functions to address the extrapolation\nchallenge. Drawing on the ALiBi approach, this study proposes a novel relative\npositional encoding method, called MEP, which employs a weighted average to\ncombine distinct kernel functions(such as the exponential kernel and the\nGaussian kernel) to generate a bias that is applied to post-softmax attention\nscores. Initially, the framework utilizes various kernel functions to construct\nmultiple kernel functions. Each kernel function adheres to a consistent mean\nweight coefficient, harnessing the synergistic advantages of different kernels\nto formulate an innovative bias function. Subsequently, specific slopes are\ntailored for each kernel function, applying penalties at varying rates, to\nenhance the model's extrapolation capabilities. Finally, this bias is\nseamlessly incorporated as a penalty to the post-softmax scores. We present two\ndistinct versions of our method: a parameter-free variant that requires no new\nlearnable parameters, which enhances length extrapolation capabilities without\ncompromising training efficiency, and a parameterized variant capable of\nintegrating state-of-the-art techniques. Empirical evaluations across diverse\ndatasets have demonstrated that both variants of our method achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming traditional parameter-free and\nparameterized approaches.",

The compression algorithm performs prediction of\neach pixel using LineRWKV, followed by entropy coding of the residual.\nExperiments on the HySpecNet-11k dataset and PRISMA images show that LineRWKV\nis the first deep-learning method to outperform CCSDS-123.0-B-2 at lossless and\nnear-lossless compression.

    "abstract": "Recent foundational language models have shown state-of-the-art performance\nin many NLP tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. An advantage of these models\nover more standard approaches based on fine-tuning is the ability to understand\ninstructions written in natural language (prompts), which helps them generalise\nbetter to different tasks and domains without the need for specific training\ndata. This makes them suitable for addressing text classification problems for\ndomains with limited amounts of annotated instances. However, existing research\nis limited in scale and lacks understanding of how text generation models\ncombined with prompting techniques compare to more established methods for text\nclassification such as fine-tuning masked language models. In this paper, we\naddress this research gap by performing a large-scale evaluation study for 16\ntext classification datasets covering binary, multiclass, and multilabel\nproblems. In particular, we compare zero- and few-shot approaches of large\nlanguage models to fine-tuning smaller language models. We also analyse the\nresults by prompt, classification type, domain, and number of labels. In\ngeneral, the results show how fine-tuning smaller and more efficient language\nmodels can still outperform few-shot approaches of larger language models,\nwhich have room for improvement when it comes to text classification.",

Although numerous\nargumentation semantics have been developed previously for identifying\nacceptable sets of arguments from an argumentation framework, there is a lack\nof justification behind their acceptability based on implicit argument\npreferences. Preference-based argumentation frameworks allow one to determine\nwhat arguments are justified given a set of preferences. Our research considers\nthe inverse of the standard reasoning problem, i.e., given an abstract\nargumentation framework and a set of justified arguments, we compute what the\npossible preferences over arguments are. Furthermore, there is a need to verify\n(i.e., assess) that the computed preferences would lead to the acceptable sets\nof arguments. This paper presents a novel approach and algorithm for\nexhaustively computing and enumerating all possible sets of preferences\n(restricted to three identified cases) for a conflict-free set of arguments in\nan abstract argumentation framework. We prove the soundness, completeness and\ntermination of the algorithm. The research establishes that preferences are\ndetermined using an extension-based approach after the evaluation phase\n(acceptability of arguments) rather than stated beforehand. In this work, we\nfocus our research study on grounded, preferred and stable semantics. We show\nthat the complexity of computing sets of preferences is exponential in the\nnumber of arguments, and thus, describe an approximate approach and algorithm\nto compute the preferences.

Utilizing one lesion delineation\ncreated by radiologists, our approach first generates a template that\nrepresents potential areas of pneumothorax occurrence. This template is then\nsuperimposed on model explanations to filter out extraneous explanations that\nfall outside the template's boundaries. To validate its efficacy, we carried\nout a comparative analysis of three XAI methods with and without our template\nguidance when explaining two DL models in two real-world datasets. Results: The\nproposed approach consistently improved baseline XAI methods across twelve\nbenchmark scenarios built on three XAI methods, two DL models, and two\ndatasets. The average incremental percentages, calculated by the performance\nimprovements over the baseline performance, were 97.8% in Intersection over\nUnion (IoU) and 94.1% in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) when comparing model\nexplanations and ground-truth lesion areas. Conclusions: In the context of\npneumothorax diagnoses, we proposed a template-guided approach for improving AI\nexplanations. We anticipate that our template guidance will forge a fresh\napproach to elucidating AI models by integrating clinical domain expertise.",

Consequently, numerous detectors\nand associated datasets have emerged.

The adaptation strategies can be typically\ncategorized into three paradigms: zero-shot adaptation, few-shot adaptation,\nand the recently-proposed training-free few-shot adaptation. Most existing\napproaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two\nof these paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a versatile adaptation approach\nthat can effectively work under all three settings. Specifically, we propose\nthe dual memory networks that comprise dynamic and static memory components.\nThe static memory caches training data knowledge, enabling training-free\nfew-shot adaptation, while the dynamic memory preserves historical test\nfeatures online during the testing process, allowing for the exploration of\nadditional data insights beyond the training set. This novel capability\nenhances model performance in the few-shot setting and enables model usability\nin the absence of training data. The two memory networks employ the same\nflexible memory interactive strategy, which can operate in a training-free mode\nand can be further enhanced by incorporating learnable projection layers. Our\napproach is tested across 11 datasets under the three task settings.\nRemarkably, in the zero-shot scenario, it outperforms existing methods by over\n3\\% and even shows superior results against methods utilizing external training\ndata.

    "abstract": "When benefiting graphic sketch representation with sketch drawing orders,\nrecent studies have linked sketch patches as graph edges by drawing orders in\naccordance to a temporal-based nearest neighboring strategy. However, such\nconstructed graph edges may be unreliable, since the contextual relationships\nbetween patches may be inconsistent with the sequential positions in drawing\norders, due to variants of sketch drawings. In this paper, we propose a\nvariant-drawing-protected method by equipping sketch patches with context-aware\npositional encoding (PE) to make better use of drawing orders for sketch\nlearning. We introduce a sinusoidal absolute PE to embed the sequential\npositions in drawing orders, and a learnable relative PE to encode the unseen\ncontextual relationships between patches. Both types of PEs never attend the\nconstruction of graph edges, but are injected into graph nodes to cooperate\nwith the visual patterns captured from patches. After linking nodes by semantic\nproximity, during message aggregation via graph convolutional networks, each\nnode receives both semantic features from patches and contextual information\nfrom PEs from its neighbors, which equips local patch patterns with global\ncontextual information, further obtaining drawing-order-enhanced sketch\nrepresentations. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly\nimproves sketch healing and controllable sketch synthesis. The source codes\ncould be found at https://github.com/SCZang/DC-gra2seq.",

It is particularly significant for aiding people\nwith speech disabilities to communicate through brain signals. This field\naddresses the complex task of mapping brain signals to text. The previous best\nattempt reverse-engineered this process in an indirect way: it began by\nlearning to encode brain activity from text and then guided text generation by\naligning with predicted brain responses. In contrast, we propose a simple yet\neffective method that guides text reconstruction by directly comparing them\nwith the predicted text embeddings mapped from brain activities. Comprehensive\nexperiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art model, showing average improvements of 77% and 54% on BLEU and\nMETEOR scores. We further validate the proposed modules through detailed\nablation studies and case analyses and highlight a critical correlation: the\nmore precisely we map brain activities to text embeddings, the better the text\nreconstruction results. Such insight can simplify the task of reconstructing\nlanguage from brain activities for future work, emphasizing the importance of\nimproving brain-to-text-embedding mapping techniques.",

Within these two settings we study optimal contract\nchoice.

    "abstract": "Requirements form the basis for defining software systems' obligations and\ntasks. Testable requirements help prevent failures, reduce maintenance costs,\nand make it easier to perform acceptance tests. However, despite the importance\nof measuring and quantifying requirements testability, no automatic approach\nfor measuring requirements testability has been proposed based on the\nrequirements smells, which are at odds with the requirements testability. This\npaper presents a mathematical model to evaluate and rank the natural language\nrequirements testability based on an extensive set of nine requirements smells,\ndetected automatically, and acceptance test efforts determined by requirement\nlength and its application domain. Most of the smells stem from uncountable\nadjectives, context-sensitive, and ambiguous words. A comprehensive dictionary\nis required to detect such words. We offer a neural word-embedding technique to\ngenerate such a dictionary automatically. Using the dictionary, we could\nautomatically detect Polysemy smell (domain-specific ambiguity) for the first\ntime in 10 application domains. Our empirical study on nearly 1000 software\nrequirements from six well-known industrial and academic projects demonstrates\nthat the proposed smell detection approach outperforms Smella, a\nstate-of-the-art tool, in detecting requirements smells. The precision and\nrecall of smell detection are improved with an average of 0.03 and 0.33,\nrespectively, compared to the state-of-the-art.

In response to this, we propose a novel Latent\nREconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting\nthe diffusion-generated images.

Our EGRE utilizes an\nalign-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for\ngenerated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive\nexperiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority\nof our LaRE^2, which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1%\naverage ACC/AP across 8 different image generators.

    "abstract": "Complex planning and scheduling problems have long been solved using various\noptimization or heuristic approaches. In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For\ninstance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on\nthe route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the\nfuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation\nlearning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model\nbut are also dependent on a cost-constrained model. In this paper, we provide\nmultiple methods that match expert distributions in the presence of trajectory\ncost constraints through (a) Lagrangian-based method; (b) Meta-gradients to\nfind a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint\nviolation; and (c) Cost-violation-based alternating gradient.

    "abstract": "Accurate transcription of Bengali text to the International Phonetic Alphabet\n(IPA) is a challenging task due to the complex phonology of the language and\ncontext-dependent sound changes. This challenge is even more for regional\nBengali dialects due to unavailability of standardized spelling conventions for\nthese dialects, presence of local and foreign words popular in those regions\nand phonological diversity across different regions. This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription. This is achieved by prepending a district token to the\ninput sequence, effectively guiding the model to understand the unique phonetic\npatterns associated with each district. The DGT technique is applied to\nfine-tune several transformer-based models, on this new dataset. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of DGT, with the ByT5 model achieving\nsuperior performance over word-based models like mT5, BanglaT5, and umT5.

We introduce ELLEN, a simple,\nfully modular, neuro-symbolic method that blends fine-tuned language models\nwith linguistic rules. These rules include insights such as ''One Sense Per\nDiscourse'', using a Masked Language Model as an unsupervised NER, leveraging\npart-of-speech tags to identify and eliminate unlabeled entities as false\nnegatives, and other intuitions about classifier confidence scores in local and\nglobal context. ELLEN achieves very strong performance on the CoNLL-2003\ndataset when using the minimal supervision from the lexicon above. It also\noutperforms most existing (and considerably more complex) semi-supervised NER\nmethods under the same supervision settings commonly used in the literature\n(i.e., 5% of the training data). Further, we evaluate our CoNLL-2003 model in a\nzero-shot scenario on WNUT-17 where we find that it outperforms GPT-3.5 and\nachieves comparable performance to GPT-4. In a zero-shot setting, ELLEN also\nachieves over 75% of the performance of a strong, fully supervised model\ntrained on gold data. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/hriaz17/ELLEN.",

These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional\ngeneration or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention\nGuidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both\nunconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring\nadditional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to\nprogressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising\nprocess. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by\nsubstituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity\nmatrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture\nstructural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these\ndegraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves\nsample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG\nsignificantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks\nwhere existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including\nControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and\ndeblurring.",

In this paper, we raise the awareness of the supplementary\nnature of method-level comments and propose a new metric named MESIA (Mean\nSupplementary Information Amount) to assess the extent of supplementary\ninformation that a code comment can provide. With the MESIA metric, we conduct\nexperiments on a popular code-comment dataset and three common types of neural\napproaches to generate method-level comments.

This approach involves defining a performance objective\nalongside CBF-based safety constraints that must always be enforced.\nUnfortunately, both performance and solution feasibility can be significantly\nimpacted by two key factors: (i) the selection of the cost function and\nassociated parameters, and (ii) the calibration of parameters within the\nCBF-based constraints, which capture the trade-off between performance and\nconservativeness. %as well as infeasibility.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved tremendous success. \\nj{However,} unlike SVMs,\nwhich provide direct decision criteria and can be trained with a small dataset,\nit still has significant weaknesses due to its requirement for massive datasets\nduring training and the black-box characteristics on decision criteria.\n\\nj{This paper addresses} these issues by identifying support vectors in deep\nlearning models. To this end, we propose the DeepKKT condition, an adaptation\nof the traditional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition for deep learning models,\nand confirm that generated Deep Support Vectors (DSVs) using this condition\nexhibit properties similar to traditional support vectors. This allows us to\napply our method to few-shot dataset distillation problems and alleviate the\nblack-box characteristics of deep learning models. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat the DeepKKT condition can transform conventional classification models\ninto generative models with high fidelity, particularly as latent\n\\jh{generative} models using class labels as latent variables. We validate the\neffectiveness of DSVs \\nj{using common datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR10 \\nj{and}\nCIFAR100) on the general architectures (ResNet and ConvNet)}, proving their\npractical applicability.

    "abstract": "The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation\nefficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient\ntraffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly\ndemands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final\npolicy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a\nnew learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is\nproposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal\nphase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects\nthe next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to\nrepresent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency\nfunction can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the\ncurrent road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform\ngradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on\nmultiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results\nindicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming\noutperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the\ntransportation field and a well-known DRL-based method.",

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has significantly advanced natural language\nprocessing (NLP) and has been foundational in developing large language models\n(LLMs) such as LLaMA and OPT, which have come to dominate a broad range of NLP\ntasks. Despite their superior accuracy, LLMs present unique challenges in\npractical inference, concerning the compute and memory-intensive nature. Thanks\nto the autoregressive characteristic of LLM inference, KV caching for the\nattention layers in Transformers can effectively accelerate LLM inference by\nsubstituting quadratic-complexity computation with linear-complexity memory\naccesses. Yet, this approach requires increasing memory as demand grows for\nprocessing longer sequences. The overhead leads to reduced throughput due to\nI/O bottlenecks and even out-of-memory errors, particularly on\nresource-constrained systems like a single commodity GPU. In this paper, we\npropose ALISA, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to address the\nchallenges imposed by KV caching. On the algorithm level, ALISA prioritizes\ntokens that are most important in generating a new token via a Sparse Window\nAttention (SWA) algorithm. SWA introduces high sparsity in attention layers and\nreduces the memory footprint of KV caching at negligible accuracy loss. On the\nsystem level, ALISA employs three-phase token-level dynamical scheduling and\noptimizes the trade-off between caching and recomputation, thus maximizing the\noverall performance in resource-constrained systems. In a single GPU-CPU\nsystem, we demonstrate that under varying workloads, ALISA improves the\nthroughput of baseline systems such as FlexGen and vLLM by up to 3X and 1.9X,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Neural topic models can successfully find coherent and diverse topics in\ntextual data. However, they are limited in dealing with multimodal datasets\n(e.g., images and text). This paper presents the first systematic and\ncomprehensive evaluation of multimodal topic modeling of documents containing\nboth text and images. In the process, we propose two novel topic modeling\nsolutions and two novel evaluation metrics. Overall, our evaluation on an\nunprecedented rich and diverse collection of datasets indicates that both of\nour models generate coherent and diverse topics. Nevertheless, the extent to\nwhich one method outperforms the other depends on the metrics and dataset\ncombinations, which suggests further exploration of hybrid solutions in the\nfuture. Notably, our succinct human evaluation aligns with the outcomes\ndetermined by our proposed metrics. This alignment not only reinforces the\ncredibility of our metrics but also highlights the potential for their\napplication in guiding future multimodal topic modeling endeavors.",

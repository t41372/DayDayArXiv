    "abstract": "The current method for predicting causal links in knowledge graphs uses\nweighted causal relations. For a given link between cause-effect entities, the\npresence of a confounder affects the causal link prediction, which can lead to\nspurious and inaccurate results. We aim to block these confounders using\nbackdoor path adjustment. Backdoor paths are non-causal association flows that\nconnect the \\textit{cause-entity} to the \\textit{effect-entity} through other\nvariables. Removing these paths ensures a more accurate prediction of causal\nlinks. This paper proposes CausalLPBack, a novel approach to causal link\nprediction that eliminates backdoor paths and uses knowledge graph link\nprediction methods. It extends the representation of causality in a\nneuro-symbolic framework, enabling the adoption and use of traditional causal\nAI concepts and methods. We demonstrate our approach using a causal reasoning\nbenchmark dataset of simulated videos. The evaluation involves a unique dataset\nsplitting method called the Markov-based split that's relevant for causal link\nprediction. The evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates atleast 30\\%\nin MRR and 16\\% in Hits@K inflated performance for causal link prediction that\nis due to the bias introduced by backdoor paths for both baseline and weighted\ncausal relations.",

    "abstract": "Preserving boundary continuity in the translation of 360-degree panoramas\nremains a significant challenge for existing text-driven image-to-image\ntranslation methods. These methods often produce visually jarring\ndiscontinuities at the translated panorama's boundaries, disrupting the\nimmersive experience. To address this issue, we propose 360PanT, a\ntraining-free approach to text-based 360-degree panorama-to-panorama\ntranslation with boundary continuity. Our 360PanT achieves seamless\ntranslations through two key components: boundary continuity encoding and\nseamless tiling translation with spatial control. Firstly, the boundary\ncontinuity encoding embeds critical boundary continuity information of the\ninput 360-degree panorama into the noisy latent representation by constructing\nan extended input image. Secondly, leveraging this embedded noisy latent\nrepresentation and guided by a target prompt, the seamless tiling translation\nwith spatial control enables the generation of a translated image with\nidentical left and right halves while adhering to the extended input's\nstructure and semantic layout. This process ensures a final translated\n360-degree panorama with seamless boundary continuity. Experimental results on\nboth real-world and synthesized datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\n360PanT in translating 360-degree panoramas.

Specifically, we propose a\ngenerative inverse graphics model of primitive shapes, to infer posterior\ndistributions over physically consistent parameters from one or several images.\nWe show how this representation can be used for downstream tasks such as\nfew-shot classification and pose estimation. Our model outperforms existing\nfew-shot neural-only classification algorithms and demonstrates generalization\nacross varying lighting conditions, backgrounds, and out-of-distribution\nshapes. By design, our model is uncertainty-aware and uses our new\ndifferentiable renderer for optimizing global scene parameters through gradient\ndescent, sampling posterior distributions over object parameters with Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and using a neural based likelihood function.",

Existing\nanti-spoofing datasets are mainly in English, and the high cost of acquiring\nmultilingual datasets hinders training language-independent models. We initiate\nthis work by evaluating top-performing speech anti-spoofing systems that are\ntrained on English data but tested on other languages, observing notable\nperformance declines. We propose an innovative approach - Accent-based data\nexpansion via TTS (ACCENT), which introduces diverse linguistic knowledge to\nmonolingual-trained models, improving their cross-lingual capabilities. We\nconduct experiments on a large-scale dataset consisting of over 3 million\nsamples, including 1.8 million training samples and nearly 1.2 million testing\nsamples across 12 languages. The language mismatch effects are preliminarily\nquantified and remarkably reduced over 15% by applying the proposed ACCENT.\nThis easily implementable method shows promise for multilingual and\nlow-resource language scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of accurately segmenting 3D Gaussian\nSplatting from 2D masks. Conventional methods often rely on iterative gradient\ndescent to assign each Gaussian a unique label, leading to lengthy optimization\nand sub-optimal solutions. Instead, we propose a straightforward yet globally\noptimal solver for 3D-GS segmentation. The core insight of our method is that,\nwith a reconstructed 3D-GS scene, the rendering of the 2D masks is essentially\na linear function with respect to the labels of each Gaussian. As such, the\noptimal label assignment can be solved via linear programming in closed form.\nThis solution capitalizes on the alpha blending characteristic of the splatting\nprocess for single step optimization. By incorporating the background bias in\nour objective function, our method shows superior robustness in 3D segmentation\nagainst noises. Remarkably, our optimization completes within 30 seconds, about\n50$\\times$ faster than the best existing methods. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method in segmenting various\nscenes, and its superior performance in downstream tasks such as object removal\nand inpainting.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce the Windows Agent Arena: a reproducible, general\nenvironment focusing exclusively on the Windows operating system (OS) where\nagents can operate freely within a real Windows OS and use the same wide range\nof applications, tools, and web browsers available to human users when solving\ntasks. We adapt the OSWorld framework (Xie et al., 2024) to create 150+ diverse\nWindows tasks across representative domains that require agent abilities in\nplanning, screen understanding, and tool usage. Our benchmark is scalable and\ncan be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as\nlittle as 20 minutes. To demonstrate Windows Agent Arena's capabilities, we\nalso introduce a new multi-modal agent, Navi. Our agent achieves a success rate\nof 19.5% in the Windows domain, compared to 74.5% performance of an unassisted\nhuman. Navi also demonstrates strong performance on another popular web-based\nbenchmark, Mind2Web.

Recent advances in diffusion models have shown impressive results\nin 3D object generation, but are limited in spatial extent and quality when\nextended to 3D scenes. To generate complex and diverse 3D scene structures, we\nintroduce a latent tree representation to effectively encode both\nlower-frequency geometry and higher-frequency detail in a coarse-to-fine\nhierarchy. We can then learn a generative diffusion process in this latent 3D\nscene space, modeling the latent components of a scene at each resolution\nlevel. To synthesize large-scale scenes with varying sizes, we train our\ndiffusion model on scene patches and synthesize arbitrary-sized output 3D\nscenes through shared diffusion generation across multiple scene patches.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of\nLT3SD for large-scale, high-quality unconditional 3D scene generation and for\nprobabilistic completion for partial scene observations.",

While off-the-shelf vision-language models\nexcel at making literal interpretations of images (e.g., recognizing object\ncategories such as tree branches), they still struggle to make sense of such\nvisual abstractions (e.g., how an arrangement of tree branches may form the\nwalls of a maze). To address this challenge, we introduce Deep Schema Grounding\n(DSG), a framework that leverages explicit structured representations of visual\nabstractions for grounding and reasoning. At the core of DSG are\nschemas--dependency graph descriptions of abstract concepts that decompose them\ninto more primitive-level symbols. DSG uses large language models to extract\nschemas, then hierarchically grounds concrete to abstract components of the\nschema onto images with vision-language models. The grounded schema is used to\naugment visual abstraction understanding. We systematically evaluate DSG and\ndifferent methods in reasoning on our new Visual Abstractions Dataset, which\nconsists of diverse, real-world images of abstract concepts and corresponding\nquestion-answer pairs labeled by humans. We show that DSG significantly\nimproves the abstract visual reasoning performance of vision-language models,\nand is a step toward human-aligned understanding of visual abstractions.",

Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar\nshortcoming exists in terms of the \\textit{auditory} knowledge. To answer this\nquestion, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of\ntwo novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge. Based on our analysis using\nthe benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of\nauditory knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel\nmethod to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based\napproach. First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our\nretrieval model efficiently. Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and\nswitch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is\nrequired. Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective,\nachieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench.

Existing\nresearch on using LLMs for entity matching has focused on prompt engineering\nand in-context learning. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs\nfor entity matching. We analyze fine-tuning along two dimensions: 1) The\nrepresentation of training examples, where we experiment with adding different\ntypes of LLM-generated explanations to the training set, and 2) the selection\nand generation of training examples using LLMs. In addition to the matching\nperformance on the source dataset, we investigate how fine-tuning affects the\nmodel's ability to generalize to other in-domain datasets as well as across\ntopical domains. Our experiments show that fine-tuning significantly improves\nthe performance of the smaller models while the results for the larger models\nare mixed. Fine-tuning also improves the generalization to in-domain datasets\nwhile hurting cross-domain transfer. We show that adding structured\nexplanations to the training set has a positive impact on the performance of\nthree out of four LLMs, while the proposed example selection and generation\nmethods only improve the performance of Llama 3.1 8B while decreasing the\nperformance of GPT-4o Mini.",

Moreover, employing a\nself-attention mechanism improves the refinement of features at each stage,\nleading to even more robust representations and improved overall performance.\nFurthermore, assigning learnable weights to each stage significantly improved\nperformance and results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the\nMiniImageNet and FC100 datasets, specifically in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way\n5-shot scenarios. Additionally, we performed cross-domain tasks across eight\nbenchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy in the testing domains. These\nevaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in comparison to\nstate-of-the-art approaches. https://github.com/FatemehAskari/MSENet",

    "abstract": "Audio-driven 3D facial animation synthesis has been an active field of\nresearch with attention from both academia and industry. While there are\npromising results in this area, recent approaches largely focus on lip-sync and\nidentity control, neglecting the role of emotions and emotion control in the\ngenerative process. That is mainly due to the lack of emotionally rich facial\nanimation data and algorithms that can synthesize speech animations with\nemotional expressions at the same time. In addition, majority of the models are\ndeterministic, meaning given the same audio input, they produce the same output\nmotion. We argue that emotions and non-determinism are crucial to generate\ndiverse and emotionally-rich facial animations. In this paper, we propose\nProbTalk3D a non-deterministic neural network approach for emotion controllable\nspeech-driven 3D facial animation synthesis using a two-stage VQ-VAE model and\nan emotionally rich facial animation dataset 3DMEAD. We provide an extensive\ncomparative analysis of our model against the recent 3D facial animation\nsynthesis approaches, by evaluating the results objectively, qualitatively, and\nwith a perceptual user study. We highlight several objective metrics that are\nmore suitable for evaluating stochastic outputs and use both in-the-wild and\nground truth data for subjective evaluation. To our knowledge, that is the\nfirst non-deterministic 3D facial animation synthesis method incorporating a\nrich emotion dataset and emotion control with emotion labels and intensity\nlevels. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art emotion-controlled, deterministic and\nnon-deterministic models.

Given their extended inspiral timescales and low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, EMRI signals warrant prolonged observation periods.\nParameter estimation becomes particularly challenging due to non-local\nparameter degeneracies, arising from multiple local maxima, as well as flat\nregions and ridges inherent in the likelihood function. These factors lead to\nexceptionally high time complexity for parameter analysis while employing\ntraditional matched filtering and random sampling methods. To address these\nchallenges, the present study applies machine learning to Bayesian posterior\nestimation of EMRI signals, leveraging the recently developed flow matching\ntechnique based on ODE neural networks.

Seismic deblending methods are always\ncomputationally demanding and normally consist of multiple processing steps.\nBesides, the parameter setting is not always trivial. Machine learning-based\nprocessing has the potential to significantly reduce processing time and to\nchange the way seismic deblending is carried out. We present a data-driven deep\nlearning-based method for fast and efficient seismic deblending. The blended\ndata are sorted from the common source to the common channel domain to\ntransform the character of the blending noise from coherent events to\nincoherent distributions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed\naccording to the special character of seismic data, and performs deblending\nwith comparable results to those obtained with conventional industry deblending\nalgorithms. To ensure authenticity, the blending was done numerically and only\nfield seismic data were employed, including more than 20000 training examples.\nAfter training and validation of the network, seismic deblending can be\nperformed in near real time. Experiments also show that the initial signal to\nnoise ratio (SNR) is the major factor controlling the quality of the final\ndeblended result. The network is also demonstrated to be robust and adaptive by\nusing the trained model to firstly deblend a new data set from a different\ngeological area with a slightly different delay time setting, and secondly\ndeblend shots with blending noise in the top part of the data.",

A novel feature of this scheme is the proposal to\nemploy adaptive weights during aggregation, a facet treated as predefined in\nother over-the-air schemes. This can mitigate the impact of wireless channel\nconditions on learning performance, without needing channel state information\nat transmitter side (CSIT). We provide a mathematical methodology to derive the\nconvergence bound for the proposed scheme in the context of computational\nheterogeneity and general loss functions, supplemented with design insights.\nAccordingly, we propose aggregation cost metrics and efficient algorithms to\nfind optimized weights for the aggregation. Finally, through numerical\nexperiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Even with\nthe challenges posed by channel conditions and device heterogeneity, the\nproposed scheme surpasses other over-the-air strategies by an accuracy\nimprovement of 15% over the scheme using CSIT and 30% compared to the one\nwithout CSIT.",

Notably,\ntransformers employing shifted window-based self-attention have demonstrated\nexceptional performance. However, their reliance on local window attention\nlimits the fusion of local and global contextual information, crucial for\nsegmenting microtumors and miniature organs. To address this limitation, we\npropose the Adaptive Semantic Segmentation Network (ASSNet), a transformer\narchitecture that effectively integrates local and global features for precise\nmedical image segmentation. ASSNet comprises a transformer-based U-shaped\nencoder-decoder network. The encoder utilizes shifted window self-attention\nacross five resolutions to extract multi-scale features, which are then\npropagated to the decoder through skip connections. We introduce an augmented\nmulti-layer perceptron within the encoder to explicitly model long-range\ndependencies during feature extraction. Recognizing the constraints of\nconventional symmetrical encoder-decoder designs, we propose an Adaptive\nFeature Fusion (AFF) decoder to complement our encoder. This decoder\nincorporates three key components: the Long Range Dependencies (LRD) block, the\nMulti-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) block, and the Adaptive Semantic Center (ASC)\nblock. These components synergistically facilitate the effective fusion of\nmulti-scale features extracted by the decoder while capturing long-range\ndependencies and refining object boundaries.

The sparse, asynchronous properties of information\nprocessing make SNNs highly energy efficient, leading to SNNs being promising\nsolutions for implementing neural networks in neuromorphic devices. However,\nthe nondifferentiable nature of SNN neurons makes it a challenge to train them.\nThe current training methods of SNNs that are based on error backpropagation\n(BP) and precisely designing surrogate gradient are difficult to implement and\nbiologically implausible, hindering the implementation of SNNs on neuromorphic\ndevices. Thus, it is important to train SNNs with a method that is both\nphysically implementatable and biologically plausible. In this paper, we\npropose using augmented direct feedback alignment (aDFA), a gradient-free\napproach based on random projection, to train SNNs. This method requires only\npartial information of the forward process during training, so it is easy to\nimplement and biologically plausible. We systematically demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the proposed aDFA-SNNs scheme, propose its effective working\nrange, and analyze its well-performing settings by employing genetic algorithm.\nWe also analyze the impact of crucial features of SNNs on the scheme, thus\ndemonstrating its superiority and stability over BP and conventional direct\nfeedback alignment.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement\nlearning (c-MADRL) is under the threat of backdoor attacks. Once a backdoor\ntrigger is observed, it will perform abnormal actions leading to failures or\nmalicious goals. However, existing proposed backdoors suffer from several\nissues, e.g., fixed visual trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is\ntrained or activated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack against c-MADRL,\nwhich attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only in a\nsingle agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior patterns\nas the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual patterns or\ninstant status and control the attack duration. This method can guarantee the\nstealthiness and practicality of injected backdoors. Secondly, we hack the\noriginal reward function of the backdoored agent via reward reverse and\nunilateral guidance during training to ensure its adverse influence on the\nentire team. We evaluate our backdoor attacks on two classic c-MADRL algorithms\nVDN and QMIX, in a popular c-MADRL environment SMAC. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our backdoor attacks are able to reach a high attack success\nrate (91.6\\%) while maintaining a low clean performance variance rate (3.7\\%).",

However, customizing edge AI\nmodels for each user's specific application or extending current models to new\napplication scenarios remains a challenge. Inappropriate local training or fine\ntuning of edge AI models by users can lead to model malfunction, potentially\nresulting in legal issues for the manufacturer. To address aforementioned\nissues, this paper proposes an innovative framework called \"DiReD\", which\ninvolves knowledge DIstillation & REverse DIstillation. In the initial step, an\nedge AI model is trained with presumed data and a KD process using the cloud AI\nmodel in the upper management cloud server. This edge AI model is then\ndispatched to edge AI devices solely for inference in the user's application\nscenario. When the user needs to update the edge AI model to better fit the\nactual scenario, the reverse distillation (RD) process is employed to extract\nthe knowledge: the difference between user preferences and the manufacturer's\npresumptions from the edge AI model using the user's exclusive data. Only the\nextracted knowledge is reported back to the upper management cloud server to\nupdate the cloud AI model, thus protecting user privacy by not using any\nexclusive data. The updated cloud AI can then update the edge AI model with the\nextended knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed \"DiReDi\"\nframework allows the manufacturer to update the user model by learning new\nknowledge from the user's actual scenario with private data.

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for preserving\ngraph topology when mapping nodes to vector representations, enabling various\ndownstream tasks such as node classification and community detection. However,\nmost current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring\nextensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in\nreal-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge,\nresearchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages\nenhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising,\nexisting GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and\nglobal graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and\ngraph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation\nEmbedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our\nmodel introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head\nattention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the\ninput graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a\nmultidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and\nneighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and\n81.6% respectively.

Given a query, RAG retrieves\nrelevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation\nprocess. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG,\nfocusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225\ndifferent setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted\ninformation, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal\npoisoning attacks in medical Q\\&A. In such attacks, adversaries generate\npoisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as\npersonally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted\ninto a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as\nattacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we\ndiscovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the\npoisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity\nbetween the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling\nprecise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based\ndefense to ensure the safe use of RAG.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing\nmethods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an\nedit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure\nfaces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual\nconsistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each\nsource image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to\nsearch for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play\nframework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image\nediting. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text\nembedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the\nrepresentations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately\nestimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based\non the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept\ntransplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To\nsufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation\ndataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of\nvisual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple\ndiffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency\npreservation.",

This raises\nthe question of whether Transformer models are real reasoning engines, despite\ntheir impressive abilities in mathematical problem solving and code synthesis.\nIn this paper, we offer a vanishing variance perspective on this issue. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that even for today's\nfrontier models, a longer sequence length results in a decrease in variance in\nthe output of the multi-head attention modules. On the argmax retrieval and\ndictionary lookup tasks, our experiments show that applying layer normalization\nafter the attention outputs leads to significantly better length\ngeneralization.

While conventional CNNs inherently support\ntranslational equivariance, extending this property to rotation and reflection\nhas proven challenging, often forcing a compromise between equivariance,\nefficiency, and information loss. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture\nRing Convolution (GMR-Conv), an efficient convolution kernel that smooths\nradial symmetry using a mixture of Gaussian-weighted rings. This design\nmitigates discretization errors of circular kernels, thereby preserving robust\nrotation and reflection equivariance without incurring computational overhead.\nWe further optimize both the space and speed efficiency of GMR-Conv via a novel\nparameterization and computation strategy, allowing larger kernels at an\nacceptable cost. Extensive experiments on eight classification and one\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that GMR-Conv not only matches conventional\nCNNs' performance but can also surpass it in applications with orientation-less\ndata. GMR-Conv is also proven to be more robust and efficient than the\nstate-of-the-art equivariant learning methods.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building\ngeneralist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot\nfoundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality\nexpert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide\nrange of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data\nprovides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and\nagent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation\nlearning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation\nrequired for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World\nModels (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data\nfor policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process\nand a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where\nindependent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply\ncontrolling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a\nforward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated\nand real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining\non large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action\npredictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation\nlearning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data\nthrough independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further\nimproving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM\noffers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for\nscalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often\ndisparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

Domestic\nservice robots with monitoring capabilities can enhance safety and provide\nessential support. Although image-based methods have advanced considerably in\nthe past decade, their adoption remains limited by concerns over privacy and\nsensitivity to low-light or dark conditions. As an alternative, millimetre-wave\n(mmWave) radar can produce point cloud data which is privacy-preserving.\nHowever, processing the sparse and noisy point clouds remains a long-standing\nchallenge. While graph-based methods and attention mechanisms show promise,\nthey predominantly rely on \"fixed\" kernels; kernels that are applied uniformly\nacross all neighbourhoods, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches that\ncan dynamically adjust their kernels to the specific geometry of each local\nneighbourhood in point cloud data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an\nadaptive approach within the graph convolutional framework. Instead of a single\nshared weight function, our Multi-Head Adaptive Kernel (MAK) module generates\nmultiple dynamic kernels, each capturing different aspects of the local feature\nspace. By progressively refining local features while maintaining global\nspatial context, our method enables convolution kernels to adapt to varying\nlocal features.

    "abstract": "The spread of scientific knowledge depends on how researchers discover and\ncite previous work. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in the\nscientific research process introduces a new layer to these citation practices.\nHowever, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs align with human citation\npractices, how they perform across domains, and may influence citation\ndynamics. Here, we show that LLMs systematically reinforce the Matthew effect\nin citations by consistently favoring highly cited papers when generating\nreferences. This pattern persists across scientific domains despite significant\nfield-specific variations in existence rates, which refer to the proportion of\ngenerated references that match existing records in external bibliometric\ndatabases. Analyzing 274,951 references generated by GPT-4o for 10,000 papers,\nwe find that LLM recommendations diverge from traditional citation patterns by\npreferring more recent references with shorter titles and fewer authors.\nEmphasizing their content-level relevance, the generated references are\nsemantically aligned with the content of each paper at levels comparable to the\nground truth references and display similar network effects while reducing\nauthor self-citations. These findings illustrate how LLMs may reshape citation\npractices and influence the trajectory of scientific discovery by reflecting\nand amplifying established trends. As LLMs become more integrated into the\nscientific research process, it is important to understand their role in\nshaping how scientific communities discover and build upon prior work.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Scene Splatter, a momentum-based paradigm for video\ndiffusion to generate generic scenes from single image. Existing methods, which\nemploy video generation models to synthesize novel views, suffer from limited\nvideo length and scene inconsistency, leading to artifacts and distortions\nduring further reconstruction. To address this issue, we construct noisy\nsamples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and\nmaintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception\nfield that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum\nrestricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions.\nTherefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a\npixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better\nrecovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion\nmodels to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further\nfinetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render\nnew frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can\niteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability and superior\nperformance of our method in high-fidelity and consistent scene generation.",

However, traditional\nexperimental methods are time-consuming and costly, and existing computational\nmodels face challenges in cross-modal feature fusion, robustness, and\nfalse-negative suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised\ncontrastive multimodal framework, SCMPPI, for PPI prediction. By integrating\nprotein sequence features (AAC, DPC, CKSAAP-ESMC) with PPI network topology\ninformation (Node2Vec graph embedding), and combining an improved supervised\ncontrastive learning strategy, SCMPPI significantly enhances PPI prediction\nperformance. For the PPI task, SCMPPI introduces a negative sample filtering\nmechanism and modifies the contrastive loss function, effectively optimizing\nmultimodal features. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including yeast,\nhuman, and H.pylori, show that SCMPPI outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods (such as DF-PPI and TAGPPI) in key metrics such as accuracy ( 98.01%)\nand AUC (99.62%), and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-species\nprediction (AUC > 99% on multi-species datasets). Furthermore, SCMPPI has been\nsuccessfully applied to CD9 networks, the Wnt pathway, and cancer-specific\nnetworks, providing a reliable tool for disease target discovery.

However, existing benchmarks, such as SWE-bench, focus\nalmost exclusively on Python, making them insufficient for evaluating Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) across diverse software ecosystems. To address this, we\nintroduce a multilingual issue-resolving benchmark, called Multi-SWE-bench,\ncovering Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C, and C++. It includes a\ntotal of 1,632 high-quality instances, which were carefully annotated from\n2,456 candidates by 68 expert annotators, ensuring that the benchmark can\nprovide an accurate and reliable evaluation. Based on Multi-SWE-bench, we\nevaluate a series of state-of-the-art models using three representative methods\n(Agentless, SWE-agent, and OpenHands) and present a comprehensive analysis with\nkey empirical insights. In addition, we launch a Multi-SWE-RL open-source\ncommunity, aimed at building large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training\ndatasets for issue-resolving tasks. As an initial contribution, we release a\nset of 4,723 well-structured instances spanning seven programming languages,\nlaying a solid foundation for RL research in this domain. More importantly, we\nopen-source our entire data production pipeline, along with detailed tutorials,\nencouraging the open-source community to continuously contribute and expand the\ndataset. We envision our Multi-SWE-bench and the ever-growing Multi-SWE-RL\ncommunity as catalysts for advancing RL toward its full potential, bringing us\none step closer to the dawn of AGI.",

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in Deep Learning models and techniques have led to\nsignificant strides in performance across diverse tasks and modalities.\nHowever, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our\nunderstanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited,\nparticularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of\nlogical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as\ncontradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous\nconclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning\ndiscrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal\nprocedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity\nof the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these\nerrors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or\nlogically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing\nnovel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs,\nnatural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for\ndetecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque\ninternal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To\nmitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a\ndata efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a\nsynthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the\nthesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning\ntasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful\nand interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference. Critically,\nthis thesis provides a comprehensive framework to improve the robustness,\nfairness, and interpretability of deep learning models across diverse tasks and\nmodalities.",

Moreover, it is\ninjective on measures and bi-Lipschitz on multisets - a significant advantage\nover prevalent methods based on sum- or max-pooling, which are provably not\nbi-Lipschitz, and, in many cases, not even injective. The required output\ndimension for these guarantees is near-optimal: roughly $2 N d$, where $N$ is\nthe maximal input multiset size.\n  Furthermore, we prove that it is impossible to embed distributions over\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ into Euclidean space in a bi-Lipschitz manner. Thus, the metric\nproperties of our embedding are, in a sense, the best possible.\n  Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method yields superior\nmultiset representations that improve performance in practical learning tasks.\nSpecifically, we show that (a) a simple combination of the FSW embedding with\nan MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance in learning the (non-sliced)\nWasserstein distance; and (b) replacing max-pooling with the FSW embedding\nmakes PointNet significantly more robust to parameter reduction, with only\nminor performance degradation even after a 40-fold reduction.",

Recently, the incentivization of\nreasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\\textit{proper learning\nmethods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of\nRL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond\nverifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to\nimprove reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries,\ni.e. the $\\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further,\nhow to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper\nlearning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward\nmodeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential\nfor inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled\nCritique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs\nthrough online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately,\nresulting in $\\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective\ninference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and\nintroduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance.\nEmpirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and\nscalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM\nbenchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared\nto training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks,\nwhich we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward\nsystems. The models will be released and open-sourced.",

To address this\nissue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,\nthis paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on\ndeep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is\nestablished. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the\nmobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance\nbehavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.\nSubsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a\nglobal path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is\ndesigned with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations\nthat occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the\nrobot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the\nproposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the\ncommunication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving\nthe real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that\nfor the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the\ndeviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence\ncan be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates\nthat the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning\nability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the\ncollaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.",

We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and\npropose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To\nsupport multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit\ngeometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed\nmethod takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in\nterms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on\nsynthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared\nto existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection aims to predict object centers, dimensions, and rotations\nfrom LiDAR point clouds. Despite its simplicity, LiDAR captures only the near\nside of objects, making center-based detectors prone to poor localization\naccuracy in cross-domain tasks with varying point distributions. Meanwhile,\nexisting evaluation metrics designed for single-domain assessment also suffer\nfrom overfitting due to dataset-specific size variations. A key question\narises: Do we really need models to maintain excellent performance in the\nentire 3D bounding boxes after being applied across domains? Actually, one of\nour main focuses is on preventing collisions between vehicles and other\nobstacles, especially in cross-domain scenarios where correctly predicting the\nsizes is much more difficult. To address these issues, we rethink cross-domain\n3D object detection from a practical perspective. We propose two new metrics\nthat evaluate a model's ability to detect objects' closer-surfaces to the LiDAR\nsensor. Additionally, we introduce EdgeHead, a refinement head that guides\nmodels to focus more on learnable closer surfaces, significantly improving\ncross-domain performance under both our new and traditional BEV/3D metrics.\nFurthermore, we argue that predicting the nearest corner rather than the object\ncenter enhances robustness. We propose a novel 3D object detector, coined as\nCornerPoint3D, which is built upon CenterPoint and uses heatmaps to supervise\nthe learning and detection of the nearest corner of each object. Our proposed\nmethods realize a balanced trade-off between the detection quality of entire\nbounding boxes and the locating accuracy of closer surfaces to the LiDAR\nsensor, outperforming the traditional center-based detector CenterPoint in\nmultiple cross-domain tasks and providing a more practically reasonable and\nrobust cross-domain 3D object detection solution.",

To mitigate\nthe negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to\nemploy collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the\nmalicious collaborative knowledge from the user's historical interactions\ninserted by attackers. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand\ninsufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\ntechniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of\nLLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative\nknowledge.

Recent\nadvances in event camera hardware show good potential for its application in\nvisual sound recovery, because of its superior ability in capturing\nhigh-frequency signals.

The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes,\nwhich are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that\ncan be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the\ntotal travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum\napproach to address it.

    "abstract": "The segmentation of pelvic fracture fragments in CT and X-ray images is\ncrucial for trauma diagnosis, surgical planning, and intraoperative guidance.\nHowever, accurately and efficiently delineating the bone fragments remains a\nsignificant challenge due to complex anatomy and imaging limitations. The\nPENGWIN challenge, organized as a MICCAI 2024 satellite event, aimed to advance\nautomated fracture segmentation by benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms on\nthese complex tasks. A diverse dataset of 150 CT scans was collected from\nmultiple clinical centers, and a large set of simulated X-ray images was\ngenerated using the DeepDRR method. Final submissions from 16 teams worldwide\nwere evaluated under a rigorous multi-metric testing scheme. The top-performing\nCT algorithm achieved an average fragment-wise intersection over union (IoU) of\n0.930, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy. However, in the X-ray task, the\nbest algorithm attained an IoU of 0.774, highlighting the greater challenges\nposed by overlapping anatomical structures. Beyond the quantitative evaluation,\nthe challenge revealed methodological diversity in algorithm design. Variations\nin instance representation, such as primary-secondary classification versus\nboundary-core separation, led to differing segmentation strategies. Despite\npromising results, the challenge also exposed inherent uncertainties in\nfragment definition, particularly in cases of incomplete fractures. These\nfindings suggest that interactive segmentation approaches, integrating human\ndecision-making with task-relevant information, may be essential for improving\nmodel reliability and clinical applicability.",

Specifically, there are no works on\nBangla text-to-gloss translation task. To address this gap, we begin by\naddressing the dataset problem. We take inspiration from grammatical rule based\ngloss generation used in Germany and American sign langauage (ASL) and adapt it\nfor BdSL. We also leverage LLM to generate synthetic data and use\nback-translation, text generation for data augmentation. With dataset prepared,\nwe started experimentation. We fine-tuned pretrained mBART-50 and\nmBERT-multiclass-uncased model on our dataset. We also trained GRU, RNN and a\nnovel seq-to-seq model with multi-head attention. We observe significant high\nperformance (ScareBLEU=79.53) with fine-tuning pretrained mBART-50 multilingual\nmodel from Facebook. We then explored why we observe such high performance with\nmBART. We soon notice an interesting property of mBART -- it was trained on\nshuffled and masked text data. And as we know, gloss form has shuffling\nproperty. So we hypothesize that mBART is inherently good at text-to-gloss\ntasks. To find support against this hypothesis, we trained mBART-50 on\nPHOENIX-14T benchmark and evaluated it with existing literature. Our mBART-50\nfinetune demonstrated State-of-the-Art performance on PHOENIX-14T benchmark,\nfar outperforming existing models in all 6 metrics (ScareBLEU = 63.89, BLEU-1 =\n55.14, BLEU-2 = 38.07, BLEU-3 = 27.13, BLEU-4 = 20.68, COMET = 0.624).

    "abstract": "Accurate and verifiable large language model (LLM) simulations of human\nresearch subjects promise an accessible data source for understanding human\nbehavior and training new AI systems. However, results to date have been\nlimited, and few social scientists have adopted these methods. In this position\npaper, we argue that the promise of LLM social simulations can be achieved by\naddressing five tractable challenges. We ground our argument in a literature\nsurvey of empirical comparisons between LLMs and human research subjects,\ncommentaries on the topic, and related work. We identify promising directions\nwith prompting, fine-tuning, and complementary methods. We believe that LLM\nsocial simulations can already be used for exploratory research, such as pilot\nexperiments for psychology, economics, sociology, and marketing. More\nwidespread use may soon be possible with rapidly advancing LLM capabilities,\nand researchers should prioritize developing conceptual models and evaluations\nthat can be iteratively deployed and refined at pace with ongoing AI advances.",

    "abstract": "Personalized image generation allows users to preserve styles or subjects of\na provided small set of images for further image generation. With the\nadvancement in large text-to-image models, many techniques have been developed\nto efficiently fine-tune those models for personalization, such as Low Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA). However, LoRA-based methods often face the challenge of\nadjusting the rank parameter to achieve satisfactory results. To address this\nchallenge, AutoComponent-LoRA (AC-LoRA) is proposed, which is able to\nautomatically separate the signal component and noise component of the LoRA\nmatrices for fast and efficient personalized artistic style image generation.\nThis method is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and dynamic\nheuristics to update the hyperparameters during training. Superior performance\nover existing methods in overcoming model underfitting or overfitting problems\nis demonstrated. The results were validated using FID, CLIP, DINO, and\nImageReward, achieving an average of 9% improvement.",

    "abstract": "Social Intelligence Queries (Social-IQ) serve as the primary multimodal\nbenchmark for evaluating a model's social intelligence level. While impressive\nmultiple-choice question(MCQ) accuracy is achieved by current solutions,\nincreasing evidence shows that they are largely, and in some cases entirely,\ndependent on language modality, overlooking visual context. Additionally, the\nclosed-set nature further prevents the exploration of whether and to what\nextent the reasoning path behind selection is correct. To address these\nlimitations, we propose the Visually Explainable and Grounded Artificial Social\nIntelligence (VEGAS) model. As a generative multimodal model, VEGAS leverages\nopen-ended answering to provide explainable responses, which enhances the\nclarity and evaluation of reasoning paths. To enable visually grounded\nanswering, we propose a novel sampling strategy to provide the model with more\nrelevant visual frames. We then enhance the model's interpretation of these\nframes through Generalist Instruction Fine-Tuning (GIFT), which aims to: i)\nlearn multimodal-language transformations for fundamental emotional social\ntraits, and ii) establish multimodal joint reasoning capabilities. Extensive\nexperiments, comprising modality ablation, open-ended assessments, and\nsupervised MCQ evaluations, consistently show that VEGAS effectively utilizes\nvisual information in reasoning to produce correct and also credible answers.\nWe expect this work to of fer a new perspective on Social-IQ and advance the\ndevelopment of human-like social AI.",

    "abstract": "Transformer models leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture complex\ndependencies, demonstrating exceptional performance in various applications.\nHowever, the long-duration high-load computations required for model inference\nimpose stringent reliability demands on the computing platform, as soft errors\nthat occur during execution can significantly degrade model performance.\nExisting fault tolerance methods protect each operation separately using\ndecoupled kernels, incurring substantial computational and memory overhead. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel error-resilient framework for Transformer\nmodels, integrating end-to-end fault tolerant attention (EFTA) to improve\ninference reliability against soft errors. Our approach enables error detection\nand correction within a fully fused attention kernel, reducing redundant data\naccess and thereby mitigating memory faults. To further enhance error coverage\nand reduce overhead, we design a hybrid fault tolerance scheme tailored for the\nEFTA, introducing for the first time: 1) architecture-aware algorithm-based\nfault tolerance (ABFT) using tensor checksum, which minimizes inter-thread\ncommunication overhead on tensor cores during error detection; 2) selective\nneuron value restriction, which selectively applies adaptive fault tolerance\nconstraints to neuron values, balancing error coverage and overhead; 3) unified\nverification, reusing checksums to streamline multiple computation steps into a\nsingle verification process. Experimental results show that EFTA achieves up to\n7.56x speedup over traditional methods with an average fault tolerance overhead\nof 13.9%.",

    "abstract": "As concerns regarding privacy in deep learning continue to grow, individuals\nare increasingly apprehensive about the potential exploitation of their\npersonal knowledge in trained models. Despite several research efforts to\naddress this, they often fail to consider the real-world demand from users for\ncomplete knowledge erasure. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that\nexisting methods have a risk of leaking personal knowledge through embedding\nfeatures. To address these issues, we introduce a novel concept of Knowledge\nDeletion (KD), an advanced task that considers both concerns, and provides an\nappropriate metric, named Knowledge Retention score (KR), for assessing\nknowledge retention in feature space. To achieve this, we propose a novel\ntraining-free erasing approach named Erasing Space Concept (ESC), which\nrestricts the important subspace for the forgetting knowledge by eliminating\nthe relevant activations in the feature. In addition, we suggest ESC with\nTraining (ESC-T), which uses a learnable mask to better balance the trade-off\nbetween forgetting and preserving knowledge in KD. Our extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets and models demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve the\nfastest and state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our methods are applicable\nto diverse forgetting scenarios, such as facial domain setting, demonstrating\nthe generalizability of our methods.

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is an increasingly\ncritical step in post-training. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has\nemerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high\nquality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated\npreference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon\nassociated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances\nperformance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by\nproviding diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during\ntraining. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models\nencounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when\nemploying stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to\ngenerate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected\nresponses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with\nrespect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model\ngeneration) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms\nconfigurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used\ndirectly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We\ndemonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability\nbetween chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit\nsuperficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our\nexperiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families,\nconsistently validate these findings.",

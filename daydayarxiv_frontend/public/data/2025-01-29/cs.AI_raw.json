    "abstract": "Time-sensitive machine learning benefits from Sequential Probability Ratio\nTest (SPRT), which provides an optimal stopping time for early classification\nof time series. However, in finite horizon scenarios, where input lengths are\nfinite, determining the optimal stopping rule becomes computationally intensive\ndue to the need for backward induction, limiting practical applicability. We\nthus introduce FIRMBOUND, an SPRT-based framework that efficiently estimates\nthe solution to backward induction from training data, bridging the gap between\noptimal stopping theory and real-world deployment. It employs density ratio\nestimation and convex function learning to provide statistically consistent\nestimators for sufficient statistic and conditional expectation, both essential\nfor solving backward induction; consequently, FIRMBOUND minimizes Bayes risk to\nreach optimality. Additionally, we present a faster alternative using Gaussian\nprocess regression, which significantly reduces training time while retaining\nlow deployment overhead, albeit with potential compromise in statistical\nconsistency. Experiments across independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.), non-i.i.d., binary, multiclass, synthetic, and real-world datasets\nshow that FIRMBOUND achieves optimalities in the sense of Bayes risk and\nspeed-accuracy tradeoff. Furthermore, it advances the tradeoff boundary toward\noptimality when possible and reduces decision-time variance, ensuring reliable\ndecision-making.

    "abstract": "Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before\nthey can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are\nrobust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs\nfocus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known\nconfounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and\nother differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness\nmetric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding\nfeatures. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find\nthat all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical\ncenter to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are\nobserved. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one,\nmeaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A\nquantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on\nFM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of\nunrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that\ncancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable\nto same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical\ncenter. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly\norganized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the\nmedical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source\nand cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim\nof advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable\npathology FMs.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, while powerful, can inadvertently generate harmful or\nundesirable content, raising significant ethical and safety concerns. Recent\nmachine unlearning approaches offer potential solutions but often lack\ntransparency, making it difficult to understand the changes they introduce to\nthe base model. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging\nfeatures learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to remove unwanted concepts in\ntext-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an\nunsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the\ndiffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to\nspecific concepts. Building on this, we propose a feature selection method that\nenables precise interventions on model activations to block targeted content\nwhile preserving overall performance. Evaluation with the competitive\nUnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUron's\nstate-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can\nremove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods,\nSAeUron mitigates the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under\nadversarial attack.

To analyze these metaphors systematically, we present a\nscalable framework integrating language modeling (LM)-based techniques to\nmeasure key dimensions of public perception: anthropomorphism (attribution of\nhuman-like qualities), warmth, and competence. We find that Americans generally\nview AI as warm and competent, and that over the past year, perceptions of AI's\nhuman-likeness and warmth have significantly increased ($+34\\%, r = 0.80, p <\n0.01; +41\\%, r = 0.62, p < 0.05$). These implicit perceptions, along with the\nidentified dominant metaphors, strongly predict trust in and willingness to\nadopt AI ($r^2 = 0.21, 0.18, p < 0.001$). Moreover, we uncover systematic\ndemographic differences in metaphors and implicit perceptions, such as the\nhigher propensity of women, older individuals, and people of color to\nanthropomorphize AI, which shed light on demographic disparities in trust and\nadoption.

The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in\nopen-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can\nsurpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2\nas a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show\nmost LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with\ntraditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty-driven strategies, unlike\nhumans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Results indicate that\ntraditional reasoning-focused LLMs, such as GPT-4o, exhibit a significantly\nfaster and less detailed reasoning process, limiting their exploratory\nperformance. In contrast, the DeepSeek reasoning model demonstrates prolonged,\niterative thought processes marked by repetitive analysis of combinations and\npast trials, reflecting a more thorough and human-like exploration strategy.\nRepresentational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) revealed\nthat uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks,\nwhile empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast\nand make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration.

This perspective offers two main\nbenefits: (i) it theoretically justifies deep ensembles and thus provides an\nexplanation for their strong empirical performance; and (ii) inspection of the\nlearned prior reveals it is given by a mixture of point masses -- the use of\nsuch a strong prior helps elucidate observed phenomena about ensembles.\nOverall, our work delivers a newfound understanding of deep ensembles which is\nnot only of interest in it of itself, but which is also likely to generate\nfuture insights that drive empirical improvements for these models.",

Experiments show that dialogue-tuned models\noutperform traditional methods, with improvements of $9.64\\%$ in multi-round\nreasoning scenarios and $6.18\\%$ in accuracy in a noisy environment. Our\nfindings highlight dialogue tuning as a promising approach for advancing\nclinically aligned and robust medical AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles,\nwhere users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled\nanonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM\nranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve\n(or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a\nstraightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles\ninvolving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and\nexclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically\ninefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average\nonly about $1\\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we\npropose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of\nChatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the\ntarget model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle.\nWe conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the\nChatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve\nmodel rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated\nseveral defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued\nefforts to prevent vote rigging.

In physical tasks such as handover, bathing, dressing, and\nrehabilitation, a key aspect of this diversity is the functional range of\nmotion (fROM), which can vary significantly between individuals. In this work,\nwe learn to predict personalized fROM as a way to generalize robot\ndecision-making in a wide range of caregiving tasks. We propose a novel\ndata-driven method for predicting personalized fROM using functional assessment\nscores from occupational therapy. We develop a neural model that learns to\nembed functional assessment scores into a latent representation of the user's\nphysical function. The model is trained using motion capture data collected\nfrom users with emulated mobility limitations. After training, the model\npredicts personalized fROM for new users without motion capture. Through\nsimulated experiments and a real-robot user study, we show that the\npersonalized fROM predictions from our model enable the robot to provide\npersonalized and effective assistance while improving the user's agency in\naction.

Biological systems, such as human toddlers,\nnaturally navigate this balance by transitioning from free exploration with\nsparse rewards to goal-directed behavior guided by increasingly dense rewards.\nInspired by this natural progression, we investigate the Toddler-Inspired\nReward Transition in goal-oriented RL tasks. Our study focuses on transitioning\nfrom sparse to potential-based dense (S2D) rewards while preserving optimal\nstrategies. Through experiments on dynamic robotic arm manipulation and\negocentric 3D navigation tasks, we demonstrate that effective S2D reward\ntransitions significantly enhance learning performance and sample efficiency.\nAdditionally, using a Cross-Density Visualizer, we show that S2D transitions\nsmooth the policy loss landscape, resulting in wider minima that improve\ngeneralization in RL models. In addition, we reinterpret Tolman's maze\nexperiments, underscoring the critical role of early free exploratory learning\nin the context of S2D rewards.",

    "abstract": "A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in\ncomputational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector,\ni.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep\nneural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings\nfor sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs,\ngiven their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing\nGPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split\ninto many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then\nbe represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such\na setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning\nwhere for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a\nsingle embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple\nset-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper,\nwe evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed\naggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques)\nincluding simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks,\nFocal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse\nand binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder,\nbreast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search\nperformance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch\nembeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) for\npruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies\nof pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning)\nremoves entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to\npreserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state\nof the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on\nan importance score measuring the impact of each neuron over the output\nmagnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention\nsubmodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the\nAttention submodules with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in\nour case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the\nsparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test\n2SSP on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\\%, 37.5\\%, and 50\\%),\nmeasuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as\nwell as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently\noutperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and\nsix downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of\npruning time.

In this paper, we\npresent a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages\nLLMs without fine-tuning. Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from\ntextual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to\nprovide the LLM with relevant context concisely. We evaluate our approach on\nthe challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs,\nincluding GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3. Our method achieves the best zero-shot\nperformance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on\nHybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up\nto 53% compared to the original context.",

    "abstract": "Transformer models have made great strides in generating symbolically\nrepresented music with local coherence. However, controlling the development of\nmotifs in a structured way with global form remains an open research area. One\nof the reasons for this challenge is due to the note-by-note autoregressive\ngeneration of such models, which lack the ability to correct themselves after\ndeviations from the motif. In addition, their structural performance on\ndatasets with shorter durations has not been studied in the literature. In this\nstudy, we propose Yin-Yang, a framework consisting of a phrase generator,\nphrase refiner, and phrase selector models for the development of motifs into\nmelodies with long-term structure and controllability. The phrase refiner is\ntrained on a novel corruption-refinement strategy which allows it to produce\nmelodic and rhythmic variations of an original motif at generation time,\nthereby rectifying deviations of the phrase generator. We also introduce a new\nobjective evaluation metric for quantifying how smoothly the motif manifests\nitself within the piece. Evaluation results show that our model achieves better\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art transformer models while having the\nadvantage of being controllable and making the generated musical structure\nsemi-interpretable, paving the way for musical analysis.

Under this\nscenario, the user may incorrectly expect some agent behavior to be inevitable\nor guaranteed. This paper addresses such expectation mismatch in the presence\nof differing models by capturing the possibility of unspecified user subgoal in\nthe context of a task captured as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and querying\nfor it as required. Our method identifies bottleneck states and uses them as\ncandidates for potential implicit subgoals. We then introduce a querying\nstrategy that will generate the minimal number of queries required to identify\na policy guaranteed to achieve the underlying goal.

Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity,\nproviding the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques.\nHowever, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune\nparadigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their\ndirect removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a\nsubstantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then\nprunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a\nsimple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for\nLLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be\npruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining\nparts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the\ninformation loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language\nmodeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS\nsignificantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning\nratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.",

    "abstract": "Social media's global reach amplifies the spread of information, highlighting\nthe need for robust Natural Language Processing tasks like stance detection\nacross languages and modalities. Prior research predominantly focuses on\ntext-only inputs, leaving multimodal scenarios, such as those involving both\nimages and text, relatively underexplored. Meanwhile, the prevalence of\nmultimodal posts has increased significantly in recent years. Although\nstate-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their performance\non multimodal and multilingual stance detection tasks remains largely\nunexamined. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on a newly extended\ndataset covering seven languages and multimodal inputs, investigating their use\nof visual cues, language-specific performance, and cross-modality interactions.\nOur results show that VLMs generally rely more on text than images for stance\ndetection and this trend persists across languages. Additionally, VLMs rely\nsignificantly more on text contained within the images than other visual\ncontent. Regarding multilinguality, the models studied tend to generate\nconsistent predictions across languages whether they are explicitly\nmultilingual or not, although there are outliers that are incongruous with\nmacro F1, language support, and model size.",

Furthermore, we utilize in-context\nmeta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the\nrelationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method\nachieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE.\nICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current\nparameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific\nenhancements of LoRA parameters.

Consequently, we conducted a rigorous Turing Test with\nGPT-4-Turbo that adhered closely to Turing's instructions for a three-player\nimitation game.

This\nchallenge arises from the difficulty of generalizing and adapting speaker\ncharacteristics in speech within zero-shot environments, which is further\ncomplicated by mismatch between the training and inference processes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose VoicePrompter, a robust zero-shot VC model\nthat leverages in-context learning with voice prompts. VoicePrompter is\ncomposed of (1) a factorization method that disentangles speech components and\n(2) a DiT-based conditional flow matching (CFM) decoder that conditions on\nthese factorized features and voice prompts. Additionally, (3) latent mixup is\nused to enhance in-context learning by combining various speaker features. This\napproach improves speaker similarity and naturalness in zero-shot VC by\napplying mixup to latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that\nVoicePrompter outperforms existing zero-shot VC systems in terms of speaker\nsimilarity, speech intelligibility, and audio quality.

We propose RegD, a novel Euclidean framework that addresses these\nlimitations by representing hierarchical data as geometric regions with two new\nmetrics: (1) depth distance, which preserves the representational power of\nhyperbolic spaces for hierarchical data, and (2) boundary distance, which\nexplicitly encodes set-inclusion relationships between regions in a general\nway. Our empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets shows consistent\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates RegD's\npotential for broader applications beyond hierarchy alone tasks.",

    "abstract": "Traditional depression screening methods, such as the PHQ-9, are particularly\nchallenging for children in pediatric primary care due to practical\nlimitations. AI has the potential to help, but the scarcity of annotated\ndatasets in mental health, combined with the computational costs of training,\nhighlights the need for efficient, zero-shot approaches. In this work, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of state-of-the-art LLMs for depressive symptom\nextraction in pediatric settings (ages 6-24). This approach aims to complement\ntraditional screening and minimize diagnostic errors.\n  Our findings show that all LLMs are 60% more efficient than word match, with\nFlan leading in precision (average F1: 0.65, precision: 0.78), excelling in the\nextraction of more rare symptoms like \"sleep problems\" (F1: 0.92) and\n\"self-loathing\" (F1: 0.8). Phi strikes a balance between precision (0.44) and\nrecall (0.60), performing well in categories like \"Feeling depressed\" (0.69)\nand \"Weight change\" (0.78). Llama 3, with the highest recall (0.90),\novergeneralizes symptoms, making it less suitable for this type of analysis.\nChallenges include the complexity of clinical notes and overgeneralization from\nPHQ-9 scores. The main challenges faced by LLMs include navigating the complex\nstructure of clinical notes with content from different times in the patient\ntrajectory, as well as misinterpreting elevated PHQ-9 scores.\n  We finally demonstrate the utility of symptom annotations provided by Flan as\nfeatures in an ML algorithm, which differentiates depression cases from\ncontrols with high precision of 0.78, showing a major performance boost\ncompared to a baseline that does not use these features.",

For risk mitigation, a guardrail is\ntypically used to filter out harmful samples before fine-tuning. By designing a\nnew red-teaming method, we in this paper show that purely relying on the\nmoderation guardrail for data filtration is not reliable. Our proposed attack\nmethod, dubbed Virus, easily bypasses the guardrail moderation by slightly\nmodifying the harmful data. Experimental results show that the harmful data\noptimized by Virus is not detectable by the guardrail with up to 100\\% leakage\nratio, and can simultaneously achieve superior attack performance. Finally, the\nkey message we want to convey through this paper is that: \\textbf{it is\nreckless to consider guardrail moderation as a clutch at straws towards harmful\nfine-tuning attack}, as it cannot solve the inherent safety issue of the\npre-trained LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/Virus",

Existing\nlearning-based query optimizers use certain model architectures to convert\ntree-structured query plans into representations suitable for downstream ML\ntasks. As the design of these architectures significantly impacts cost\nestimation, we propose a tree model architecture based on Bidirectional Graph\nNeural Networks (Bi-GNN) aggregated by Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to achieve\nmore accurate cost estimates. The inherent uncertainty of data and model\nparameters also leads to inaccurate cost estimates, resulting in suboptimal\nplans and less robust query performance. To address this, we implement a novel\nlearning-to-rank cost model that effectively quantifies the uncertainty in cost\nestimates using approximate probabilistic ML. This model adaptively integrates\nquantified uncertainty with estimated costs and learns from comparing pairwise\nplans, achieving more robust performance. In addition, we propose the first\nexplainability technique specifically designed for learning-based cost models.\nThis technique explains the contribution of any subgraphs in the query plan to\nthe final predicted cost, which can be integrated and trained with any\nlearning-based cost model to significantly boost the model's explainability. By\nincorporating these innovations, we propose a cost model for a Robust and\nExplainable Query Optimizer, Reqo, that improves the accuracy, robustness, and\nexplainability of cost estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in\nall three dimensions.",

However, optimizing\nKAN structures is labor-intensive, typically requiring manual intervention and\nparameter tuning. This paper proposes GA-KAN, a genetic algorithm-based\napproach that automates the optimization of KANs, requiring no human\nintervention in the design process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time that evolutionary computation is explored to optimize KANs\nautomatically. Furthermore, inspired by the use of sparse connectivity in MLPs\nin effectively reducing the number of parameters, GA-KAN further explores\nsparse connectivity to tackle the challenge of extensive parameter spaces in\nKANs. GA-KAN is validated on two toy datasets, achieving optimal results\nwithout the manual tuning required by the original KAN. Additionally, GA-KAN\ndemonstrates superior performance across five classification datasets,\noutperforming traditional methods on all datasets and providing interpretable\nsymbolic formulae for the Wine and Iris datasets, thereby enhancing model\ntransparency. Furthermore, GA-KAN significantly reduces the number of\nparameters over the standard KAN across all the five datasets. The core\ncontributions of GA-KAN include automated optimization, a new encoding\nstrategy, and a new decoding process, which together improve the accuracy and\ninterpretability, and reduce the number of parameters.",

However, real-world navigation robots often operate in\npersistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual\nobservations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task\nsetting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating\ncontinuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these\nreal-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to\nexecute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously\nadapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task,\none has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD\ndata, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each\nscene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly\nexpands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R\ndataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts.\nFurthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that\nleverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing\ntechniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is\nmotivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent\nsignatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various\nmethods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which\nincorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific\ntraining strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.",

We begin by conceiving the\nintensional inheritance of $W$ from $F$ as the amount of information the\nproposition \"x is $F$ \" provides about the proposition \"x is $W$. To flesh this\nout, we consider concepts $F$ and $W$ defined by sets of properties\n$\\left\\{F_{1}, F_{2}, \\ldots, F_{n}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{W_{1}, W_{2}, \\ldots,\nW_{m}\\right\\}$ with associated degrees $\\left\\{d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots,\nd_{n}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{e_{1}, e_{2}, \\ldots, e_{m}\\right\\}$, respectively,\nwhere the properties may overlap. We then derive formulas for the intensional\ninheritance using both Shannon information theory and algorithmic information\ntheory, incorporating interaction information among properties. We examine a\nspecial case where all properties are mutually exclusive and calculate the\nintensional inheritance in this case in both frameworks. We also derive\nexpressions for $P(W \\mid F)$ based on the mutual information formula. Finally\nwe consider the relationship between intensional inheritance and conventional\nset-theoretic \"extensional\" inheritance, concluding that in our\ninformation-theoretic framework, extensional inheritance emerges as a special\ncase of intensional inheritance.",

The Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism\n(CASRM) was introduced as a novel framework designed to address limitations in\ncoherence, contextual adaptability, and error propagation in large-scale text\ngeneration tasks. Through the integration of dynamically generated context\nvectors and attention modulation layers, CASRM enhances the alignment between\ntoken-level representations and broader contextual dependencies.

A detailed computational analysis revealed that while CASRM\nintroduces additional processing overhead, the gains in linguistic precision\nand contextual relevance outweigh the marginal increase in complexity. The\nframework also successfully mitigates error propagation in sequential tasks,\nimproving performance in dialogue continuation and multi-step text synthesis.\nAdditional investigations into token-level attention distribution emphasized\nthe dynamic focus shifts enabled through context-aware enhancements.

For instance, a trained\nRL model often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task,\nsuch as a change in background color or other minor semantic differences. To\naddress this issue, we propose a dual-agent adversarial policy learning\nframework, which allows agents to spontaneously learn the underlying semantics\nwithout introducing any human prior knowledge. Specifically, our framework\ninvolves a game process between two agents: each agent seeks to maximize the\nimpact of perturbing on the opponent's policy by producing representation\ndifferences for the same state, while maintaining its own stability against\nsuch perturbations. This interaction encourages agents to learn generalizable\npolicies, capable of handling irrelevant features from the high-dimensional\nobservations. Extensive experimental results on the Procgen benchmark\ndemonstrate that the adversarial process significantly improves the\ngeneralization performance of both agents, while also being applied to various\nRL algorithms, e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). With the adversarial\nframework, the RL agent outperforms the baseline methods by a significant\nmargin, especially in hard-level tasks, marking a significant step forward in\nthe generalization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Watermarking, the practice of embedding imperceptible information into media\nsuch as images, videos, audio, and text, is essential for intellectual property\nprotection, content provenance and attribution. The growing complexity of\ndigital ecosystems necessitates watermarks for different uses to be embedded in\nthe same media. However, to detect and decode all watermarks, they need to\ncoexist well with one another. We perform the first study of coexistence of\ndeep image watermarking methods and, contrary to intuition, we find that\nvarious open-source watermarks can coexist with only minor impacts on image\nquality and decoding robustness. The coexistence of watermarks also opens the\navenue for ensembling watermarking methods. We show how ensembling can increase\nthe overall message capacity and enable new trade-offs between capacity,\naccuracy, robustness and image quality, without needing to retrain the base\nmodels.",

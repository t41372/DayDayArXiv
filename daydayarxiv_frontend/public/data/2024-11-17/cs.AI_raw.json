Even commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to 'understand'\nmany of the problems (when given the input and output grids), which makes\ndiscovering solutions by LLM-lead program search somewhat futile.\n  In this work, LLM 'understanding' is attempted from a stronger starting\nposition : An LLM is given complete solutions to tasks in code, and then asked\nto explain how the task is being solved at various levels of abstraction.\nSpecifically, the LLM was given code solutions implemented in arc-dsl-llm (an\nLLM-legible version of Hodel's arc-dsl to obtain: (a) commented code; (b) code\nrefactored into reusable functional chunks; (c) problem solution steps; and (d)\nhigh-level problem-solving tactics.\n  We demonstrate that 'Sparks of Abstraction' can be extracted from the LLM\noutput - in a form that could be used in downstream tasks with Local LLMs\neligible to enter the ARC Prize.\n  Both the arc-dsl-llm DSL framework (with the re-engineered solutions) and the\nGemini LLM-generated data (along with the generation code) are made Open\nSource.",

However, most existing methods rely heavily on\nstrong appearance priors for object discovery, therefore only working on those\nclasses of objects on which the method has been trained, or do not allow for\nobject manipulation, which is necessary to scan objects fully and to guide\nobject discovery in challenging scenarios. We address these limitations with a\nnovel interaction-guided and class-agnostic method based on object\ndisplacements that allows a user to move around a scene with an RGB-D camera,\nhold up objects, and finally outputs one 3D model per held-up object. Our main\ncontribution to this end is a novel approach to detecting user-object\ninteractions and extracting the masks of manipulated objects. On a\ncustom-captured dataset, our pipeline discovers manipulated objects with 78.3%\nprecision at 100% recall and reconstructs them with a mean chamfer distance of\n0.90cm.

    "abstract": "This paper builds upon our previous work on the Reconciled Polynomial Network\n(RPN). The original RPN model was designed under the assumption of input data\nindependence, presuming the independence among both individual instances within\ndata batches and attributes in each data instance. However, this assumption\noften proves invalid for function learning tasks involving complex,\ninterdependent data such as language, images, time series, and graphs. Ignoring\nsuch data interdependence may inevitably lead to significant performance\ndegradation.\n  To overcome these limitations, we introduce the new Reconciled Polynomial\nNetwork (version 2), namely RPN 2, in this paper. By incorporating data and\nstructural interdependence functions, RPN 2 explicitly models data\ninterdependence via new component functions in its architecture.\n  This enhancement not only significantly improves RPN 2's learning performance\nbut also substantially expands its unifying potential, enabling it to encompass\na broader range of contemporary dominant backbone models within its canonical\nrepresentation. These backbones include, but are not limited to, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), graph neural networks\n(GNNs), and Transformers. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental\ndistinctions among these backbone models primarily stem from their diverse\napproaches to defining the interdependence functions. Furthermore, this unified\nrepresentation opens up new opportunities for designing innovative\narchitectures with the potential to surpass the performance of these dominant\nbackbones.",

In the context of mineral site records, accurate\nrecord linkage is crucial for identifying and mapping mineral deposits.\nProperly linking records that refer to the same mineral deposit helps define\nthe spatial coverage of mineral areas, benefiting resource identification and\nsite data archiving. Mineral site record linkage falls under the spatial record\nlinkage category since the records contain information about the physical\nlocations and non-spatial attributes in a tabular format. The task is\nparticularly challenging due to the heterogeneity and vast scale of the data.\nWhile prior research employs pre-trained discriminative language models (PLMs)\non spatial entity linkage, they often require substantial amounts of curated\nground-truth data for fine-tuning. Gathering and creating ground truth data is\nboth time-consuming and costly. Therefore, such approaches are not always\nfeasible in real-world scenarios where gold-standard data are unavailable.\nAlthough large generative language models (LLMs) have shown promising results\nin various natural language processing tasks, including record linkage, their\nhigh inference time and resource demand present challenges.

To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a new\nattack method called CLMIA, which uses unsupervised contrastive learning to\ntrain an attack model without using extra membership status information.\nMeanwhile, in CLMIA, we require only a small amount of data with known\nmembership status to fine-tune the attack model.

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac\nmonitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due\nto the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have\nbeen developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload.\nDespite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the\ninherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying\nsampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and\nintricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper\nintroduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust\nrepresentations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG\nTokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by\nproxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact,\nand clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic\nmorphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively\nmitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic\npattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event\nsemantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is\ncapable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG\nsignals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental\nresults show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6%\nacross four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification,\ncorrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common\nECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\neach of these tasks.",

    "abstract": "Anticipating the multimodality of future events lays the foundation for safe\nautonomous driving. However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents\nhas been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works\npredominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this\nchallenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and uncalibrated\nmode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating\nexcessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to\nidentify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles\nand compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce\nModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences.\nUnlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one\nshot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step,\nthereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and\nsignificantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging\nthe inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the\nEarly-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories\nfurther. Without relying on dense mode prediction or heuristic post-processing,\nModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while\nattaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance\non motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the\ncapability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior\nmodes when the future is highly uncertain.",

    "abstract": "In a setting where segmentation models have to be built for multiple\ndatasets, each with its own corresponding label set, a straightforward way is\nto learn one model for every dataset and its labels. Alternatively, multi-task\narchitectures with shared encoders and multiple segmentation heads or shared\nweights with compound labels can also be made use of. This work proposes a\nnovel label sharing framework where a shared common label space is constructed\nand each of the individual label sets are systematically mapped to the common\nlabels. This transforms multiple datasets with disparate label sets into a\nsingle large dataset with shared labels, and therefore all the segmentation\ntasks can be addressed by learning a single model. This eliminates the need for\ntask specific adaptations in network architectures and also results in\nparameter and data efficient models. Furthermore, label sharing framework is\nnaturally amenable for incremental learning where segmentations for new\ndatasets can be easily learnt. We experimentally validate our method on various\nmedical image segmentation datasets, each involving multi-label segmentation.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of\nperformance and incremental learning ability vis-a-vis alternative methods.",

SLS poses unique challenges due to its blend of cooperative and\nadversarial dynamics, making it an ideal platform for studying multi-agent\nlearning and game theory. The study's primary goal is to teach autonomous\nagents the game's rules and strategies using classical DRL methods. To support\nthis effort, the authors developed a novel, publicly available implementation\nof SLS, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) and benchmarking tools for\nDRL algorithms. Experimental results reveal that while considered basic by\nmodern DRL standards, DQN, DDQN, and Dueling DQN agents achieved roughly 50% of\nthe maximum possible game reward. This suggests a baseline understanding of the\ngame's mechanics, with agents favoring legal moves over illegal ones. However,\na significant limitation was the extensive training required, around 2000\ngames, for agents to reach peak performance, compared to human players who\ngrasp the game within a few rounds. Even after prolonged training, agents\noccasionally made illegal moves, highlighting both the potential and\nlimitations of these classical DRL methods in semi-complex, socially driven\ngames. The findings establish a foundational benchmark for training agents in\nSLS and similar negotiation-based environments while underscoring the need for\nadvanced or hybrid DRL approaches to improve learning efficiency and\nadaptability.

    "abstract": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has driven significant progress in\nmedical applications, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However,\ncurrent medical LLMs struggle with TCM diagnosis and syndrome differentiation\ndue to substantial differences between TCM and modern medical theory, and the\nscarcity of specialized, high-quality corpora. This paper addresses these\nchallenges by proposing BianCang, a TCM-specific LLM, using a two-stage\ntraining process that first injects domain-specific knowledge and then aligns\nit through targeted stimulation. To enhance diagnostic and differentiation\ncapabilities, we constructed pre-training corpora, instruction-aligned datasets\nbased on real hospital records, and the ChP-TCM dataset derived from the\nPharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. We compiled extensive TCM and\nmedical corpora for continuous pre-training and supervised fine-tuning,\nbuilding a comprehensive dataset to refine the model's understanding of TCM.\nEvaluations across 11 test sets involving 29 models and 4 tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of BianCang, offering valuable insights for future research.\nCode, datasets, and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/QLU-NLP/BianCang.",

    "abstract": "Currently, high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed in an\naccelerating pace. Among them, Diffusion Models have led to a remarkable\nimprovement in the quality of image generation, making it vary challenging to\ndistinguish between real and synthesized images. It simultaneously raises\nserious concerns regarding privacy and security. Some methods are proposed to\ndistinguish the diffusion model generated images through reconstructing.\nHowever, the inversion and denoising processes are time-consuming and heavily\nreliant on the pre-trained generative model. Consequently, if the pre-trained\ngenerative model meet the problem of out-of-domain, the detection performance\ndeclines. To address this issue, we propose a universal synthetic image\ndetector Time Step Generating (TSG), which does not rely on pre-trained models'\nreconstructing ability, specific datasets, or sampling algorithms. Our method\nutilizes a pre-trained diffusion model's network as a feature extractor to\ncapture fine-grained details, focusing on the subtle differences between real\nand synthetic images. By controlling the time step t of the network input, we\ncan effectively extract these distinguishing detail features. Then, those\nfeatures can be passed through a classifier (i.e. Resnet), which efficiently\ndetects whether an image is synthetic or real. We test the proposed TSG on the\nlarge-scale GenImage benchmark and it achieves significant improvements in both\naccuracy and generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the emergence of backdoor attacks has presented\nsignificant challenges to deep learning systems, allowing attackers to insert\nbackdoors into neural networks. When data with a trigger is processed by a\nbackdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas\nnormal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding\nbeyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language\nprocessing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense\nmethods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their\napplication in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly\napplicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition,\nvisual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial\nconcern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting\nmultimodal applications or related tasks.\n  In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce\nBackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for\nmultimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven\ncommonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning\npipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and\nevaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed\nevaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities,\nBackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types.\nFurthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical\nfactors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and\nerroneous labels. We anticipate that BackdoorMBTI will expedite future research\nin backdoor defense methods within a multimodal context. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/SJTUHaiyangYu/BackdoorMBTI.",

    "abstract": "Predicting and constructing road geometric information (e.g., lane lines,\nroad markers) is a crucial task for safe autonomous driving, while such static\nmap elements can be repeatedly occluded by various dynamic objects on the road.\nRecent studies have shown significantly improved vectorized high-definition\n(HD) map construction performance, but there has been insufficient\ninvestigation of temporal information across adjacent input frames (i.e.,\nclips), which may lead to inconsistent and suboptimal prediction results. To\ntackle this, we introduce a novel paradigm of clip-level vectorized HD map\nconstruction, MapUnveiler, which explicitly unveils the occluded map elements\nwithin a clip input by relating dense image representations with efficient clip\ntokens. Additionally, MapUnveiler associates inter-clip information through\nclip token propagation, effectively utilizing long-term temporal map\ninformation. MapUnveiler runs efficiently with the proposed clip-level pipeline\nby avoiding redundant computation with temporal stride while building a global\nmap relationship. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MapUnveiler\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse2\nbenchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "A random recurrent neural network, called a reservoir, can be used to learn\nrobot movements conditioned on context inputs that encode task goals. The\nLearning is achieved by mapping the random dynamics of the reservoir modulated\nby context to desired trajectories via linear regression. This makes the\nreservoir computing (RC) approach computationally efficient as no iterative\ngradient descent learning is needed. In this work, we propose a novel RC-based\nLearning from Demonstration (LfD) framework that not only learns to generate\nthe demonstrated movements but also allows online modulation of the reservoir\ndynamics to generate movement trajectories that are not covered by the initial\ndemonstration set. This is made possible by using a Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nmodule that learns a policy to output context as its actions based on the robot\nstate. Considering that the context dimension is typically low, learning with\nthe RL module is very efficient. We show the validity of the proposed model\nwith systematic experiments on a 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) simulated robot\nthat is taught to reach targets, encoded as context, with and without obstacle\navoidance constraint. The initial data set includes a set of reaching\ndemonstrations which are learned by the reservoir system. To enable reaching\nout-of-distribution targets, the RL module is engaged in learning a policy to\ngenerate dynamic contexts so that the generated trajectory achieves the desired\ngoal without any learning in the reservoir system. Overall, the proposed model\nuses an initial learned motor primitive set to efficiently generate diverse\nmotor behaviors guided by the designed reward function. Thus the model can be\nused as a flexible and effective LfD system where the action repertoire can be\nextended without new data collection.",

We also explored the application of FSL for the classification of\nhyperspectral images of bulk grains to enable rapid quality assessment at\nvarious receival points in the grain supply chain.

Our findings\nshow that both transcribed feedback and surgical video are individually\npredictive of trainee behavior changes, and their combination achieves an AUROC\nof 0.70+/-0.02, improving prediction accuracy by up to 6.6%. Additionally, we\nintroduce self-supervised fine-tuning as a strategy for enhancing surgical\nvideo representation learning, which is scalable and further enhances\nprediction performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of multi-modal\nlearning to advance the automated assessment of surgical feedback.",

    "abstract": "Modern industrial infrastructures rely heavily on Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS), but these are vulnerable to cyber-attacks with potentially catastrophic\neffects. To reduce these risks, anomaly detection methods based on physical\ninvariants have been developed. However, these methods often require\ndomain-specific expertise to manually define invariants, making them costly and\ndifficult to scale. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to\nextract physical invariants from CPS testbeds for anomaly detection. Our\ninsight is that CPS design documentation often contains semantically rich\ndescriptions of physical procedures, which can profile inter-correlated\ndynamics among system components. Leveraging the built-in physics and\nengineering knowledge of recent generative AI models, we aim to automate this\ntraditionally manual process, improving scalability and reducing costs. This\nwork focuses on designing and optimizing a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG)\nworkflow with a customized prompting system tailored for CPS documentation,\nenabling accurate extraction of semantic information and inference of physical\ninvariants from complex, multimodal content. Then, rather than directly\napplying the inferred invariants for anomaly detection, we introduce an\ninnovative statistics-based learning approach that integrates these invariants\ninto the training dataset. This method addresses limitations such as\nhallucination and concept drift, enhancing the reliability of the model. We\nevaluate our approach on real-world public CPS security dataset which contains\n86 data points and 58 attacking cases. The results show that our approach\nachieves a high precision of 0.923, accurately detecting anomalies while\nminimizing false alarms.",

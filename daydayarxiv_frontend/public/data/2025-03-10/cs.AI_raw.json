    "abstract": "Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural\ndiversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language\n(VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that\nfail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an\nopen-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally\nrelevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries,\nSEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering\ngreater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond\ncrowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the\nautomatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image\ngeneration. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85%\ncultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than\ncrowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision\nmodels, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA\ncultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and\ncultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA\nculturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing\ndatasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA,\nfostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically\nrepresent diverse cultures across SEA.",

    "abstract": "Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact\nwith webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such\nagents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks,\nevaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge.\nTo this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a \"small but mighty\" benchmark of 111\ninformation-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to\nsearch, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web\nagent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content\nrather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability\nof real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal\ninteractions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed\nvia text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding\nshort, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing\nfor transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study\nconfirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human\naccuracy), revealing search inefficiencies and domain knowledge gaps as common\nfailure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents\nunderperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only\n24.3% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement,\nincluding reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities.\nTo facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace\ninvalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future\ngenerations of web agents.",

Despite their\nadvances, challenges specific to remote sensing remain substantial. Firstly,\nThe SAM without clear prompt constraints, often generates redundant masks, and\nmaking post-processing more complex. Secondly, the CLIP model, mainly designed\nfor global feature alignment in foundational models, often overlooks local\nobjects crucial to remote sensing. This oversight leads to inaccurate\nrecognition or misplaced focus in multi-target remote sensing imagery. Thirdly,\nboth models have not been pre-trained on multi-scale aerial views, increasing\nthe likelihood of detection failures. To tackle these challenges, we introduce\nthe innovative VTPSeg pipeline, utilizing the strengths of Grounding DINO,\nCLIP, and SAM for enhanced open-vocabulary image segmentation. The Grounding\nDINO+(GD+) module generates initial candidate bounding boxes, while the CLIP\nFilter++(CLIP++) module uses a combination of visual and textual prompts to\nrefine and filter out irrelevant object bounding boxes, ensuring that only\npertinent objects are considered. Subsequently, these refined bounding boxes\nserve as specific prompts for the FastSAM model, which executes precise\nsegmentation. Our VTPSeg is validated by experimental and ablation study\nresults on five popular remote sensing image segmentation datasets.",

To address this gap, we used an Activity Theory framework to\nexamine how developers with visual impairments interact with AI coding\nassistants. For this purpose, we conducted a study where developers who are\nvisually impaired completed a series of programming tasks using a generative AI\ncoding assistant. We uncovered that, while participants found the AI assistant\nbeneficial and reported significant advantages, they also highlighted\naccessibility challenges. Specifically, the AI coding assistant often\nexacerbated existing accessibility barriers and introduced new challenges. For\nexample, it overwhelmed users with an excessive number of suggestions, leading\ndevelopers who are visually impaired to express a desire for ``AI timeouts.''\nAdditionally, the generative AI coding assistant made it more difficult for\ndevelopers to switch contexts between the AI-generated content and their own\ncode. Despite these challenges, participants were optimistic about the\npotential of AI coding assistants to transform the coding experience for\ndevelopers with visual impairments. Our findings emphasize the need to apply\nactivity-centered design principles to generative AI assistants, ensuring they\nbetter align with user behaviors and address specific accessibility needs. This\napproach can enable the assistants to provide more intuitive, inclusive, and\neffective experiences, while also contributing to the broader goal of enhancing\naccessibility in software development.",

    "abstract": "Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has\nunlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety\nconcerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to\nadversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in\nreal-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the\nnovel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the\nphysical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In\nthis paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure\nthe safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined\nsafety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust\nLLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety\nspecifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves\npotential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a\npossibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures\nsafety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive\nsimulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking\nattacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans\nfrom 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also\ndemonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive\nattacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to\nperform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to\nmitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.",

Traditional methods, such as heuristic and learning-based\napproaches, are effective but face challenges like lengthy recommendation time,\nresource-intensive training, and poor generalization across different workloads\nand database schemas. To address these issues, we propose LLMIdxAdvis, a\nresource-efficient index advisor that uses large language models (LLMs) without\nextensive fine-tuning. LLMIdxAdvis frames index recommendation as a\nsequence-to-sequence task, taking target workload, storage constraint, and\ncorresponding database environment as input, and directly outputting\nrecommended indexes. It constructs a high-quality demonstration pool offline,\nusing GPT-4-Turbo to synthesize diverse SQL queries and applying integrated\nheuristic methods to collect both default and refined labels. During\nrecommendation, these demonstrations are ranked to inject database expertise\nvia in-context learning. Additionally, LLMIdxAdvis extracts workload features\ninvolving specific column statistical information to strengthen LLM's\nunderstanding, and introduces a novel inference scaling strategy combining\nvertical scaling (via ''Index-Guided Major Voting'' and Best-of-N) and\nhorizontal scaling (through iterative ''self-optimization'' with database\nfeedback) to enhance reliability. Experiments on 3 OLAP and 2 real-world\nbenchmarks reveal that LLMIdxAdvis delivers competitive index recommendation\nwith reduced runtime, and generalizes effectively across different workloads\nand database schemas.",

    "abstract": "When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases\nbut can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To\nmeasure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics\nhave been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias\namplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these\nmetrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they\ncannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in\ncaptions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in\nCaptioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it\nhas limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified,\npoorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy,\nand is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in\npredictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional\nPredictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional\nbias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias\nusing an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker\nmodels. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the\nmost reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.",

While existing geospatial QA datasets exist,\nthey are limited in both scale and diversity, often relying solely on textual\ndescriptions of geo-entities without considering their geometries. A major\nchallenge in scaling geospatial QA datasets for reasoning lies in the\ncomplexity of geospatial relationships, which require integrating spatial\nstructures, topological dependencies, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities that\nmost text-based QA datasets lack. To address these limitations, we introduce\nMapQA, a novel dataset that not only provides question-answer pairs but also\nincludes the geometries of geo-entities referenced in the questions. MapQA is\nconstructed using SQL query templates to extract question-answer pairs from\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) for two study regions: Southern California and Illinois. It\nconsists of 3,154 QA pairs spanning nine question types that require geospatial\nreasoning, such as neighborhood inference and geo-entity type identification.\nCompared to existing datasets, MapQA expands both the number and diversity of\ngeospatial question types. We explore two approaches to tackle this challenge:\n(1) a retrieval-based language model that ranks candidate geo-entities by\nembedding similarity, and (2) a large language model (LLM) that generates SQL\nqueries from natural language questions and geo-entity attributes, which are\nthen executed against an OSM database. Our findings indicate that\nretrieval-based methods effectively capture concepts like closeness and\ndirection but struggle with questions that require explicit computations (e.g.,\ndistance calculations). LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini) excel at generating SQL\nqueries for one-hop reasoning but face challenges with multi-hop reasoning,\nhighlighting a key bottleneck in advancing geospatial QA systems.",

    "abstract": "Critical learning periods (CLPs) in federated learning (FL) refer to early\nstages during which low-quality contributions (e.g., sparse training data\navailability) can permanently impair the learning performance of the global\nmodel owned by the model owner (i.e., the cloud server). However, strategies to\nmotivate clients with high-quality contributions to join the FL training\nprocess and share trained model updates during CLPs remain underexplored.\nAdditionally, existing incentive mechanisms in FL treat all training periods\nequally, which consequently fails to motivate clients to participate early.\nCompounding this challenge is the cloud's limited knowledge of client training\ncapabilities due to privacy regulations, leading to information asymmetry.\nTherefore, in this article, we propose a time-aware incentive mechanism, called\nRight Reward Right Time (R3T), to encourage client involvement, especially\nduring CLPs, to maximize the utility of the cloud in FL. Specifically, the\ncloud utility function captures the trade-off between the achieved model\nperformance and payments allocated for clients' contributions, while accounting\nfor clients' time and system capabilities, efforts, joining time, and rewards.\nThen, we analytically derive the optimal contract for the cloud and devise a\nCLP-aware mechanism to incentivize early participation and efforts while\nmaximizing cloud utility, even under information asymmetry. By providing the\nright reward at the right time, our approach can attract the highest-quality\ncontributions during CLPs. Simulation and proof-of-concept studies show that\nR3T increases cloud utility and is more economically effective than benchmarks.\nNotably, our proof-of-concept results show up to a 47.6% reduction in the total\nnumber of clients and up to a 300% improvement in convergence time while\nreaching competitive test accuracies compared with incentive mechanism\nbenchmarks.",

In this work we introduce two novel image-caption datasets for\ntraining of remote sensing foundation models. The first dataset pairs aerial\nand satellite imagery with captions generated by Gemini using landmarks\nextracted from Google Maps.

Finally, we present our ongoing\nresearch to distill image-level knowledge gained in the VLM contrastive\ntraining procedure to enhance the model's localization ability.

    "abstract": "Recent Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods encapsulating relational\ninformation via masking in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising\nperformance. However, most existing approaches rely on random masking\nstrategies in either feature or graph space, which may fail to capture\ntask-relevant information fully. We posit that this limitation stems from an\ninability to achieve minimum redundancy between masked and unmasked components\nwhile ensuring maximum relevance of both to potential downstream tasks.\nConditional Independence (CI) inherently satisfies the minimum redundancy and\nmaximum relevance criteria, but its application typically requires access to\ndownstream labels. To address this challenge, we introduce CIMAGE, a novel\napproach that leverages Conditional Independence to guide an effective masking\nstrategy within the latent space. CIMAGE utilizes CI-aware latent factor\ndecomposition to generate two distinct contexts, leveraging high-confidence\npseudo-labels derived from unsupervised graph clustering. In this framework,\nthe pretext task involves reconstructing the masked second context solely from\nthe information provided by the first context. Our theoretical analysis further\nsupports the superiority of CIMAGE's novel CI-aware masking method by\ndemonstrating that the learned embedding exhibits approximate linear\nseparability, which enables accurate predictions for the downstream task.\nComprehensive evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks illustrate the\nadvantage of CIMAGE, with notably higher average rankings on node\nclassification and link prediction tasks. Notably, our proposed model\nhighlights the under-explored potential of CI in enhancing graph SSL\nmethodologies and offers enriched insights for effective graph representation\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in three-dimensional (3D)\nagricultural research, particularly for maize, has been limited by the scarcity\nof large-scale, diverse datasets. While 2D image datasets are abundant, they\nfail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant\nvolume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this\nlimitation, we present AgriField3D\n(https://baskargroup.github.io/AgriField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point\nclouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be\nAI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset comprises over 1,000\nhigh-quality point clouds collected using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner,\ncomplemented by procedural models that provide structured, parametric\nrepresentations of maize plants. These procedural models, generated using\nNon-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) and optimized via a two-step process\ncombining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and differentiable programming,\nenable precise, scalable reconstructions of leaf surfaces and plant\narchitectures. To enhance usability, we performed graph-based segmentation to\nisolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all\nsamples. We also conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets,\ncorrecting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and\nvalidating metadata annotations. The dataset further includes metadata\ndetailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled\nversions (100k, 50k, 10k points) optimized for various computational needs. By\nintegrating point cloud data of field grown plants with high-fidelity\nprocedural models and ensuring meticulous manual validation, AgriField3D\nprovides a comprehensive foundation for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural\nanalysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.",

    "abstract": "The theory of optimal transportation has developed into a powerful and\nelegant framework for comparing probability distributions, with wide-ranging\napplications in all areas of science. The fundamental idea of analyzing\nprobabilities by comparing their underlying state space naturally aligns with\nthe core idea of causal inference, where understanding and quantifying\ncounterfactual states is paramount. Despite this intuitive connection, explicit\nresearch at the intersection of optimal transport and causal inference is only\nbeginning to develop. Yet, many foundational models in causal inference have\nimplicitly relied on optimal transport principles for decades, without\nrecognizing the underlying connection. Therefore, the goal of this review is to\noffer an introduction to the surprisingly deep existing connections between\noptimal transport and the identification of causal effects with observational\ndata -- where optimal transport is not just a set of potential tools, but\nactually builds the foundation of model assumptions. As a result, this review\nis intended to unify the language and notation between different areas of\nstatistics, mathematics, and econometrics, by pointing out these existing\nconnections, and to explore novel problems and directions for future work in\nboth areas derived from this realization.",

While accelerometry-based sensor\ndata are widely adopted in training artificial intelligence models to estimate\npatient mobility, existing approaches face two key limitations highlighted in\nclinical practice: (1) modeling the long-term accelerometer data is challenging\ndue to the high dimensionality, variability, and noise, and (2) the absence of\nefficient and robust methods for long-term mobility assessment. To overcome\nthese challenges, we introduce MELON, a novel multimodal framework designed to\npredict 12-hour mobility status in the critical care setting. MELON leverages\nthe power of a dual-branch network architecture, combining the strengths of\nspectrogram-based visual representations and sequential accelerometer\nstatistical features. MELON effectively captures global and fine-grained\nmobility patterns by integrating a pre-trained image encoder for rich\nfrequency-domain feature extraction and a Mixture-of-Experts encoder for\nsequence modeling. We trained and evaluated the MELON model on the multimodal\ndataset of 126 patients recruited from nine Intensive Care Units at the\nUniversity of Florida Health Shands Hospital main campus in Gainesville,\nFlorida. Experiments showed that MELON outperforms conventional approaches for\n12-hour mobility status estimation with an overall area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 (95\\%, confidence interval\n0.78-0.86).

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful and accessible\nto human users, ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups, i.e.,\ngroup fairness, is a critical ethical concern. However, current fairness and\nbias research in LLMs is limited in two aspects. First, compared to traditional\ngroup fairness in machine learning classification, it requires that the\nnon-sensitive attributes, in this case, the prompt questions, be the same\nacross different groups. In many practical scenarios, different groups,\nhowever, may prefer different prompt questions and this requirement becomes\nimpractical. Second, it evaluates group fairness only for the LLM's final\noutput without identifying the source of possible bias. Namely, the bias in\nLLM's output can result from both the pretraining and the finetuning. For\nfinetuning, the bias can result from both the RLHF procedure and the learned\nreward model. Arguably, evaluating the group fairness of each component in the\nLLM pipeline could help develop better methods to mitigate the possible bias.\nRecognizing those two limitations, this work benchmarks the group fairness of\nlearned reward models. By using expert-written text from arXiv, we are able to\nbenchmark the group fairness of reward models without requiring the same prompt\nquestions across different demographic groups. Surprisingly, our results\ndemonstrate that all the evaluated reward models (e.g., Nemotron-4-340B-Reward,\nArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1, and GRM-llama3-8B-sftreg) exhibit statistically\nsignificant group unfairness. We also observed that top-performing reward\nmodels (w.r.t. canonical performance metrics) tend to demonstrate better group\nfairness.",

Centralised\ncollection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from\nlarge populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition,\ndata governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel\nprivacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD\ndetection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our\nframework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site\nfirst trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection\n(VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This\nenables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy\ncases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining\nprivacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach,\nDivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without\ndata exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal\nrepresentations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our\napproach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites.

This gap has the effect of impeding effective\ncommunication and also limits the accessibility of information. Controlling\nreadability of textual data is an important element for creating summaries for\ndifferent audiences with varying literacy and education levels, such as\nstudents ranging from primary school to graduate level, as well as individuals\nwith diverse educational backgrounds. Summaries that align with the needs of\nspecific reader groups can improve comprehension and engagement, ensuring that\nthe intended message is effectively communicated. Furthermore, readability\nadjustment is essential to expand the usability of summarization models in\neducational and professional domains. Current summarization models often don't\nhave the mechanisms to adjust the complexity of their outputs, resulting in\nsummaries that may be too simplistic or overly complex for certain types of\nreader groups. Developing adaptive models that can tailor content to specific\nreadability levels is therefore crucial.

    "abstract": "The article analyses foundational principles relevant to the creation of\nartificial general intelligence (AGI). Intelligence is understood as the\nability to create novel skills that allow to achieve goals under previously\nunknown conditions. To this end, intelligence utilises reasoning methods such\nas deduction, induction and abduction as well as other methods such as\nabstraction and classification to develop a world model. The methods are\napplied to indirect and incomplete representations of the world, which are\nobtained through perception, for example, and which do not depict the world but\nonly correspond to it. Due to these limitations and the uncertain and\ncontingent nature of reasoning, the world model is constructivist. Its value is\nfunctionally determined by its viability, i.e., its potential to achieve the\ndesired goals. In consequence, meaning is assigned to representations by\nattributing them a function that makes it possible to achieve a goal. This\nrepresentational and functional conception of intelligence enables a\nnaturalistic interpretation that does not presuppose mental features, such as\nintentionality and consciousness, which are regarded as independent of\nintelligence. Based on a phenomenological analysis, it is shown that AGI can\ngain a more fundamental access to the world than humans, although it is limited\nby the No Free Lunch theorems, which require assumptions to be made.",

    "abstract": "Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs)\nrequires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can\nbe costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of\nhigh-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining\nperformance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often\noverlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is\nhighly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations\nor paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained\nresources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this,\nwe introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data\nselection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images\nand generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates\nthe relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive\ntask-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task,\nselecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces\ncomputational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data\nformation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the\nimages, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the\nLLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

This\nlimitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data\nis scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score\ndistillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training\nhigh-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a\ndiffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it\ninto a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While\nscore distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion\nmodels, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality,\nparticularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise\nlevels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe\nsummarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical\ninsights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace\nof the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the\ngenerator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for\nefficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly\nin low-quality data settings.",

The correctness of\ngenerated patches is then evaluated by executing a human-written test suite\nextracted from the repository after the issue's resolution.

    "abstract": "Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving\nthe reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning\non search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches\nefficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale\nas the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We\nformalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement\nlearning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending\ntest-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream\nfrom the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to\nuse a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the\nefficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff\nexploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would\nalso provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token\nstream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one\ncan do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome\n0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in\nthe output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual\nsuccess. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or\nMRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT\nleads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token\nefficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.",

For example, while retrieving a target object from a cluttered workspace,\nin principle the number of object re-arrangements required to finally grasp it\ncannot be known ahead of time. To address this challenge, and in contrast to\ntraditional planners, also those based on AND/OR graphs, we grow the AND/OR\ngraph at run-time by progressively adding sub-graphs until grasping the target\nobject becomes feasible, which yields a network of AND/OR graphs.

    "abstract": "Wearable health devices have a strong demand in real-time biomedical signal\nprocessing. However traditional methods often require data transmission to\ncentralized processing unit with substantial computational resources after\ncollecting it from edge devices. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging field\nthat seeks to design specialized hardware for computing systems inspired by the\nstructure, function, and dynamics of the human brain, offering significant\nadvantages in latency and power consumption. This paper explores a novel\nneuromorphic implementation approach for gesture recognition by extracting\nspatiotemporal spiking information from surface electromyography (sEMG) data in\nan event-driven manner. At the same time, the network was designed by\nimplementing a simple-structured and hardware-friendly Physical Reservoir\nComputing (PRC) framework called Rotating Neuron Reservoir (RNR) within the\ndomain of Spiking neural network (SNN). The spiking RNR (sRNR) is promising to\npipeline an innovative solution to compact embedded wearable systems, enabling\nlow-latency, real-time processing directly at the sensor level. The proposed\nsystem was validated by an open-access large-scale sEMG database and achieved\nan average classification accuracy of 74.6\\% and 80.3\\% using a classical\nmachine learning classifier and a delta learning rule algorithm respectively.\nWhile the delta learning rule could be fully spiking and implementable on\nneuromorphic chips, the proposed gesture recognition system demonstrates the\npotential for near-sensor low-latency processing.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nvarious tasks, yet still produce errors in domain-specific tasks. To further\nimprove their performance, we propose KSOD (Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On\nDemand), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to improve their capabilities\nwith knowledge-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT). KSOD analyzes the causes of\nerrors from the perspective of knowledge deficiency by identifying potential\nmissing knowledge in LLM that may lead to the errors. Subsequently, KSOD tunes\na knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the\nidentified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD\nsupplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module.\nTuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and\nknowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four\ngeneral benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance\nof LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their\nperformance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of\nimproving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.",

    "abstract": "Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a \"near-miss\nsyndrome\": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails\nunit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework\ncalled Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively\napplying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal\nprompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in\ndebugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with\nthe generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by\ncomparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also\nevaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each\ngeneration. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms\nboth conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional\ngenetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone,\nsolving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across\nexperiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the\nPSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not\nsurpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results\non HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average\npass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at\nleast once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama\n3-8B. We conclude that SEIDR effectively overcomes the near-miss syndrome in\nprogram synthesis with LLMs.",

Such abilities would make LLMs more\ninterpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in\nlinguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking \"Is this\nsentence grammatical?\"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection\nacross 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of\ntheoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in\nboth domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically\ngrounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether\nmodels' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal\nknowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a\nmodel's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what\nwould be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge.\nWhile both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high\ntask accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged \"self-access\".\nOur findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect,\nand add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be\nconflated with models' linguistic generalizations.",

This allows seamless integration of visual tokens into existing\nLLMs for autoregressive visual generation. Second, we present a masked\nautoregressive Rectified-Flow decoder, employing a masked transformer\nencoder-decoder to refine visual tokens into contextually enriched embeddings.\nThese embeddings then condition a dedicated velocity field for precise\nreconstruction. Additionally, an autoregressive rectified-flow sampling\nstrategy is incorporated, ensuring flexible sequence lengths while preserving\ncompetitive reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments show that V2Flow\noutperforms mainstream VQ-based tokenizers and facilitates autoregressive\nvisual generation on top of existing. https://github.com/zhangguiwei610/V2Flow",

    "abstract": "Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to estimate whether a specific data\npoint was used in the training of a given model. Previous attacks often utilize\nmultiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution,\nleading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages\nquantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture\nepistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work,\nwe propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA),\nwhich performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we\ntransform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace\napproximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score\ndistribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both\nepistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling\nefficient and powerful MIA.

Recent research on using LLMs to generate\nScalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating\ndiagram creation.

We\naddress three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math\ndiagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG\nis an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what\nprompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate\nSVG-based diagrams.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image\ngeneration, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW\nimages. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the\nmodel to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully\nerase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical\nexpressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal\ngeneration capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE,\nusing a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off\nbetween reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by\nerasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By\nidentifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we\noptimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually\nsimilar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being\noverly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process.\nFollowing this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling\ntrajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising\nprediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through\ncontrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious\ncontent. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple\nmalicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its\neffectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's\noriginal generation ability.

Discussed scenarios range from human extinction after a misaligned TAI\ntakes over (\"AI doom\") to unprecedented economic growth and abundance\n(\"post-scarcity\").

Against the backdrop of the continuous iteration and\nupgrading of current AI technologies, to meet the demand for accurate\nrecognition of disordered targets by intelligent robots in complex and\nchangeable scenarios, this study innovatively proposes an AI - based\nintelligent robot disordered target recognition method using reinforcement\nlearning.

Subsequently, it adopts differentiated AI strategies,\ncompressing the illumination images and enhancing the reflection images\nrespectively, and then fuses the two parts of images to generate a new image.\nOn this basis, this study deeply integrates deep learning, a core AI\ntechnology, with the reinforcement learning algorithm. The enhanced target\nimages are input into a deep reinforcement learning model for training,\nultimately enabling the AI - based intelligent robot to efficiently recognize\ndisordered targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not\nonly significantly improve the quality of target images but also enable the AI\n- based intelligent robot to complete the recognition task of disordered\ntargets with higher efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating extremely high\napplication value and broad development prospects in the field of AI robots.",

Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their\nfilters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory\nperformance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance\nbottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally.\nOur first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results:\nAlthough images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have\nobjects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the\ntraining dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are\nactually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also\nnegatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a\nsignificantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to\nconsider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors\nand filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset\nthat semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted\nOoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness\nscore, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a\ncombined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving\nbenchmark BDD-100K.

Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent\ninteracting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in\nmulti-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot human-AI coordination is the training of an ego-agent to coordinate\nwith humans without using human data. Most studies on zero-shot human-AI\ncoordination have focused on enhancing the ego-agent's coordination ability in\na given environment without considering the issue of generalization to unseen\nenvironments. Real-world applications of zero-shot human-AI coordination should\nconsider unpredictable environmental changes and the varying coordination\nability of co-players depending on the environment. Previously, the multi-agent\nUED (Unsupervised Environment Design) approach has investigated these\nchallenges by jointly considering environmental changes and co-player policy in\ncompetitive two-player AI-AI scenarios. In this paper, our study extends the\nmulti-agent UED approach to a zero-shot human-AI coordination. We propose a\nutility function and co-player sampling for a zero-shot human-AI coordination\nsetting that helps train the ego-agent to coordinate with humans more\neffectively than the previous multi-agent UED approach. The zero-shot human-AI\ncoordination performance was evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment, using\nhuman proxy agents and real humans. Our method outperforms other baseline\nmodels and achieves a high human-AI coordination performance in unseen\nenvironments.",

In\ncontrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and\nprivacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale\nannotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To\nbridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation\nframework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the\nIMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a\npretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue,\naligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings.

Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets\ndemonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification\nperformance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised\nfine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset\ngeneralization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally\napplicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the\npotential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in\nfuture research.

    "abstract": "Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave\nof progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic\nbiology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell\nmembranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial\nprocesses including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and\ntissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these\nsignals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in\norganisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps\nremain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal\ndynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles\nin tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in\ndiseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time\nmanipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and\nmorphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with\nbiological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback.\nCombining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics,\nvoltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could\nprovide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to\nimproved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative\nbioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and\nadvancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative\nmedicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize\nbioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Time series analysis is crucial in fields like finance, transportation, and\nindustry. However, traditional models often focus solely on temporal features,\nlimiting their ability to capture underlying information. This paper proposes a\nnovel time series multitask framework, called LTM, which integrates temporal\nfeatures with textual descriptions to enhance analytical and predictive\ncapabilities. LTM combines pre-trained time series model, large language model\n(LLM), and knowledge graph to tackle time series tasks, including forecasting,\nimputation, and anomaly detection. LTM achieves improved performance with a few\ntrainable parameters. It is very efficient and practical. LTM encodes time\nseries data into patches and enriches user-provided prompts using knowledge\ngraphs to generate enhanced prompts. A novel feature fusion method embeds\nprompts into each patch encoding, which is processed by a frozen LLM, followed\nby a feature enhancement module and a time decoder module. During fine-tuning\nstage, cosine similarity between prompts and temporal patches is integrated\ninto the loss function to boost performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nshow that LTM significantly outperforms existing methods. It provides a robust\nand versatile solution for time series tasks.",

The perceived efforts\nand risks of complying with the GDPR further increase when data processing\nactivities span across organisational boundaries, as is the case in both\nsmall-scale data sharing settings and in large-scale international data spaces.\n  This paper addresses these concerns by proposing a case-generic method for\nautomated normative reasoning that establishes legal arguments for the\nlawfulness of data processing activities.

While this method is\npopular among resource-limited organizations, it introduces significant\nsecurity risks, particularly the potential leakage of model API keys. Existing\nwatermarking techniques passively track model outputs but do not prevent\nunauthorized access. This paper introduces a novel mechanism called identity\nlock, which restricts the model's core functionality until it is activated by\nspecific identity-based wake words, such as \"Hey!

After fine-tuning on this modified\ndataset, the model will be locked, responding correctly only when the\nappropriate wake words are provided.

Due to the high costs of setting up and running\nexperiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE\nsimulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve\nsuch IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design\nparameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical\nconstraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials\nduring the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend\nto require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials.\nFurthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the\nneed for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the\nadvantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its\nmeshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work\npresents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully\ndifferentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design\nparameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods'\ncomputational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of\nPINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take\ninto account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters.

To address these issues, the airfoil inverse design framework based\non the classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (CDDPM)\nis proposed innovatively in this paper. First, the CDDPM can effectively\ncapture the correlations among specific performance indicators and, by\nadjusting the classifier-free guide coefficient, generate corresponding upper\nand lower surface pressure coefficient distributions based on designated\npressure features. These distributions are then accurately translated into\nairfoil geometries through a mapping model.

Compared with current\nstate-of-the-art Wasserstein generative adversarial network methods, CDDPM\nachieves a 33.6% precision improvement in airfoil generating tasks. Moreover, a\npractical method to readjust each performance indicator value is proposed based\non global optimization algorithm in conjunction with active learning strategy,\naiming to provide rational value combination of performance indicators for the\ninverse design framework.

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nreconstruction performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1e-3 and a\ncosine similarity of 0.97, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing\nactivation dynamics along the denoising trajectory. Beyond interpretability, we\nshowcase TIDE's potential in downstream applications such as sparse\nactivation-guided image editing and style transfer, enabling improved\ncontrollability for generative systems.

Despite diffusion-based methods have made significant\nstrides in the field of image inpainting, challenges remain regarding the\nemergence of unexpected objects or artifacts. We assert that the inexact\ndiffusion pathways established by existing standard optimization paradigms\nconstrain the efficacy of object removal. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel Erase Diffusion, termed EraDiff, aimed at unleashing the\npotential power of standard diffusion in the context of object removal. In\ncontrast to standard diffusion, the EraDiff adapts both the optimization\nparadigm and the network to improve the coherence and elimination of the\nerasure results. We first introduce a Chain-Rectifying Optimization (CRO)\nparadigm, a sophisticated diffusion process specifically designed to align with\nthe objectives of erasure. This paradigm establishes innovative diffusion\ntransition pathways that simulate the gradual elimination of objects during\noptimization, allowing the model to accurately capture the intent of object\nremoval. Furthermore, to mitigate deviations caused by artifacts during the\nsampling pathways, we develop a simple yet effective Self-Rectifying Attention\n(SRA) mechanism. The SRA calibrates the sampling pathways by altering\nself-attention activation, allowing the model to effectively bypass artifacts\nwhile further enhancing the coherence of the generated content.

In\ntraffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as\nan agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and\nreal-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of\nintersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter\nmethods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements\nin the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of\nnetwork parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does\nnot necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our\nexperiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization\nof intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this\nend, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization\n(HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL\nmethod that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized\npolicies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The\ncentralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the\ngraph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates\nwith multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution\nactor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of\naction as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values\nestimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC\npolicies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables\nmultiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized\npolicies.",

This brief paper analyzes how more affordable AI\nengagement and Western countries' development cooperation present developing\nnations with a complex choice between accessibility and governance standards. I\nargue this challenge entails new institutional mechanisms for technology\ntransfer and regulatory cooperation, while carefully balancing universal\nstandards with local needs. In turn, good practices could help developing\ncountries close the deepening gap of global technological divides, while\nensuring responsible AI development in developing countries.",

Multi-behavior recommender systems leverage these diverse\ninteractions to enhance recommendation quality, and research on this topic has\ngrown rapidly in recent years. This survey provides a timely review of\nmulti-behavior recommender systems, focusing on three key steps: (1) Data\nModeling: representing multi-behaviors at the input level, (2) Encoding:\ntransforming these inputs into vector representations (i.e., embeddings), and\n(3) Training: optimizing machine-learning models. We systematically categorize\nexisting multi-behavior recommender systems based on the commonalities and\ndifferences in their approaches across the above steps.

To address\nthis problem, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) guided Progressive\nfeature Alignment Network called LPANet, which leverages the semantic features\nextracted from a large language model to guide the progressive semantic and\nspatial alignment between modalities for multimodal UAV object detection. To\nemploy the powerful semantic representation of LLM, we generate the\nfine-grained text descriptions of each object category by ChatGPT and then\nextract the semantic features using the large language model MPNet. Based on\nthe semantic features, we guide the semantic and spatial alignments in a\nprogressive manner as follows. First, we design the Semantic Alignment Module\n(SAM) to pull the semantic features and multimodal visual features of each\nobject closer, alleviating the semantic differences of objects between\nmodalities. Second, we design the Explicit Spatial alignment Module (ESM) by\nintegrating the semantic relations into the estimation of feature-level\noffsets, alleviating the coarse spatial misalignment between modalities.\nFinally, we design the Implicit Spatial alignment Module (ISM), which leverages\nthe cross-modal correlations to aggregate key features from neighboring regions\nto achieve implicit spatial alignment.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and\nvideo synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for\nreal-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been\nproposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous\ntimesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at\ntimesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion\nmodels decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors\nintroduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To\nsolve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of\ndiffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at\nprevious timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and\ncontinuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to\napproximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in\nfuture timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis,\nespecially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost\nlossless acceleration of 4.99$\\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\\times$ on HunyuanVideo\nwithout additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with\nprevious SOTA at $4.53$$\\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the\nsupplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

To fill this gap, we\nintroduce the Text-Humanization Benchmark (TH-Bench), the first comprehensive\nbenchmark to evaluate evading attacks against MGT detectors. TH-Bench evaluates\nattacks across three key dimensions: evading effectiveness, text quality, and\ncomputational overhead. Our extensive experiments evaluate 6 state-of-the-art\nattacks against 13 MGT detectors across 6 datasets, spanning 19 domains and\ngenerated by 11 widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that no single evading\nattack excels across all three dimensions. Through in-depth analysis, we\nhighlight the strengths and limitations of different attacks. More importantly,\nwe identify a trade-off among three dimensions and propose two optimization\ninsights. Through preliminary experiments, we validate their correctness and\neffectiveness, offering potential directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "The ability to interpret and intervene model decisions is important for the\nadoption of computer-aided diagnosis methods in clinical workflows. Recent\nconcept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts\nand modify their activation scores to interact with the model. However, these\nconcepts are at the image level, which hinders the model from pinpointing the\nexact patches the concepts are activated. Alternatively, prototype-based\nmethods learn representations from training image patches and compare these\nwith test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class\nprediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can\nbe challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this\nissue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning\nnetwork (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept\ninterpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR\nprovides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image\nregions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing\ndoctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive\nand transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior\nstate-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.5\\% across three biomedical\ndatasets. Our code is released at https://github.com/tadeephuy/InteractCSR.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their role\nin robotic task planning. However, while LLMs have been explored for generating\nfeasible task sequences, their ability to ensure safe task execution remains\nunderdeveloped. Existing methods struggle with structured risk perception,\nmaking them inadequate for safety-critical applications where low-latency\nhazard adaptation is required. To address this limitation, we propose a\nGraphormer-enhanced risk-aware task planning framework that combines LLM-based\ndecision-making with structured safety modeling. Our approach constructs a\ndynamic spatio-semantic safety graph, capturing spatial and contextual risk\nfactors to enable online hazard detection and adaptive task refinement. Unlike\nexisting methods that rely on predefined safety constraints, our framework\nintroduces a context-aware risk perception module that continuously refines\nsafety predictions based on real-time task execution. This enables a more\nflexible and scalable approach to robotic planning, allowing for adaptive\nsafety compliance beyond static rules. To validate our framework, we conduct\nexperiments in the AI2-THOR environment. The experiments results validates\nimprovements in risk detection accuracy, rising safety notice, and task\nadaptability of our framework in continuous environments compared to static\nrule-based and LLM-only baselines.

However, since the parameter magnitude of the\nfully connected (FC) layer directly depends on the number of identities in the\ndataset. If training the FR model on large-scale datasets, the size of the\nmodel parameter will be excessively huge, leading to substantial demand for\ncomputational resources, such as time and memory. This paper proposes the\nattention fully connected (AttFC) layer, which could significantly reduce\ncomputational resources. AttFC employs an attention loader to generate the\ngenerative class center (GCC), and dynamically store the class center with\nDynamic Class Container (DCC). DCC only stores a small subset of all class\ncenters in FC, thus its parameter count is substantially less than the FC\nlayer. Also, training face recognition models on large-scale datasets with one\nGPU often encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues. AttFC overcomes this and\nachieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.",

Traditional methods, dependent on invasive tissue\nsampling, often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor.

Foundation\ndeep learning models, which learn robust, task-agnostic representations from\nlarge-scale datasets, hold great promise but remain underutilized in glioma\nimaging biomarkers.

The model was trained and validated on a\ndiverse, multi-center cohort of 2,249 glioma patients from seven public\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the\nsignificant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and\nthe challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed\nrobotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent\ngeneralization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this\nthesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by\nintegrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale\nlearning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is:\nhow can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key\ninsight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level\ncontrol end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more\nefficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in\nbuilding generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast\namounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source\nof supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source:\nclassical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires\naccess to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these\nplanners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce\ngeneralist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with\nlarge-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of\nperforming zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key\ningredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control,\nprocedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real\ntransfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist\nagent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real\nworld.",

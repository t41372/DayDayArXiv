    "abstract": "The capacity for complex mathematical reasoning is a key benchmark for\nartificial intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs\nshows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale\ntraining data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer\nformats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation\nbenchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new,\nlarge-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems,\nspecifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K\nis curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent\ndecontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty\n(primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in\nchallenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based\nRL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training\nparadigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of\nmathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable\nreasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve\nsignificant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its\neffectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community\nprogress in building more capable AI reasoning systems:\nhttps://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath.",

However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into\ndiscrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained\nstructural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate\nthe design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations.

Masculine\ndefaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine\ncharacteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance\nof, those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work, we study\ndiscourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the\nlarge-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken\ncontent via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the\nmeasurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words\nin LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus\nour study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing\n15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse\nwords -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered\ndiscourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse\nwords in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based\nmasculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and\nvideo games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse\nwords from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that\nthe masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than\nthe feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on\ndownstream tasks for men. Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns\nwith better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models\n-- and this embedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculine\ndefault.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models.\nDuring this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between\nthe output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer\nmore information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework\nexhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different\noutput spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the\nstudent model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different\nvocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the\ndistributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different\nprediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and\ndimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge\ndistillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher\nand the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors\nwith ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the\nstudent/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from\ndifferent models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the\ndistributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm\nto align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the\nabove, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both\noff-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their\nvocabularies. Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical\nreasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly\noutperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and\nsurpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different\nvocabularies.",

This training-inference divergences hinder the\nalignment between inference and training data distributions, due to potential\nprediction biases and cumulative error accumulation. To address this problem,\nwe propose an intuitive but effective fine-tuning framework, called Adversarial\nDiffusion Tuning (ADT), by stimulating the inference process during\noptimization and aligning the final outputs with training data by adversarial\nsupervision. Specifically, to achieve robust adversarial training, ADT features\na siamese-network discriminator with a fixed pre-trained backbone and\nlightweight trainable parameters, incorporates an image-to-image sampling\nstrategy to smooth discriminative difficulties, and preserves the original\ndiffusion loss to prevent discriminator hacking. In addition, we carefully\nconstrain the backward-flowing path for back-propagating gradients along the\ninference path without incurring memory overload or gradient explosion.\nFinally, extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion models (v1.5, XL, and v3),\ndemonstrate that ADT significantly improves both distribution alignment and\nimage quality.",

This study\ninvestigates whether neural networks can autonomously internalize spatial\nconcepts through interaction, focusing on planar navigation tasks. Using Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRUs) combined with Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), we\nshow that agents can learn to encode spatial properties like direction,\ndistance, and obstacle avoidance. We introduce Hybrid Dynamical Systems (HDS)\nto model the agent-environment interaction as a closed dynamical system,\nrevealing stable limit cycles that correspond to optimal navigation strategies.\nRidge Representation allows us to map navigation paths into a fixed-dimensional\nbehavioral space, enabling comparison with neural states. Canonical Correlation\nAnalysis (CCA) confirms strong alignment between these representations,\nsuggesting that the agent's neural states actively encode spatial knowledge.\nIntervention experiments further show that specific neural dimensions are\ncausally linked to navigation performance.

Combining modern and classical techniques offers a\npath to maintaining competitive performance while enabling practical\napplications. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) methodology empowers\nexperts to design convolutional encoders through user-drawn markers, with\nfilters learned directly from these annotations.

    "abstract": "Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated significant success in\ndynamic graph tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Both tasks\ncomprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known\nnodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to\npreviously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual\nscenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural\ninformation, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish\nknown nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in\ntransductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge,\nwe propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces\nautomatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal\npositional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each\nnode's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a\nstandard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances\ntransductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on\nthree real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong\nbaselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating\nits ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for\ndynamic graph learning.",

By collecting large amounts of input-output data, where inputs\nrepresent system states and outputs are MPC-generated control actions, NNs can\nbe trained to replicate MPC behavior at a fraction of the computational cost.\nHowever, although the composition of the training data critically influences\nthe final NN accuracy, methods for systematically optimizing it remain\nunderexplored.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of OSDs by training NNs to replicate\nthe University of Virginia's MPC algorithm for automated insulin delivery in\nType-1 Diabetes, achieving a four-fold improvement in final accuracy.

Although TPPs effectively capture\ntemporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge.\nRecent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods\nfail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to\ngenerate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule\nTemporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal\nlogic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and\npredictive accuracy in event modeling.

To evaluate our\nmethod, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule\nvalidity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results\non real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms\nstate-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and\nclinical interpretability.

    "abstract": "Wood defect detection is critical for ensuring quality control in the wood\nprocessing industry. However, current industrial applications face two major\nchallenges: traditional methods are costly, subjective, and labor-intensive,\nwhile mainstream deep learning models often struggle to balance detection\naccuracy and computational efficiency for edge deployment. To address these\nissues, this study proposes CFIS-YOLO, a lightweight object detection model\noptimized for edge devices. The model introduces an enhanced C2f structure, a\ndynamic feature recombination module, and a novel loss function that\nincorporates auxiliary bounding boxes and angular constraints. These\ninnovations improve multi-scale feature fusion and small object localization\nwhile significantly reducing computational overhead. Evaluated on a public wood\ndefect dataset, CFIS-YOLO achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of\n77.5\\%, outperforming the baseline YOLOv10s by 4 percentage points. On SOPHON\nBM1684X edge devices, CFIS-YOLO delivers 135 FPS, reduces power consumption to\n17.3\\% of the original implementation, and incurs only a 0.5 percentage point\ndrop in mAP. These results demonstrate that CFIS-YOLO is a practical and\neffective solution for real-world wood defect detection in resource-constrained\nenvironments.",

Prior work has solely focused\non constrained multi-task settings where there is a one-to-one mapping between\na sample and a task, overlooking the paradigm where multiple tasks may operate\non the same sample, e.g., scene understanding. In this paper, we focus on the\nmulti-task setting with single-input-multiple-outputs (SIMO) and show that it\nqualitatively differs from the single-input-single-output model merging\nsettings studied in the literature due to the existence of task-specific\ndecoders and diverse loss objectives.

We propose two simple and efficient fixes for the SIMO setting to\nre-align the feature representation after merging. Compared to joint\nfine-tuning, our approach is computationally effective and flexible, and sheds\nlight into identifying task relationships in an offline manner. Experiments on\nNYUv2, Cityscapes, and a subset of the Taskonomy dataset demonstrate: (1) task\narithmetic suffices to enable multi-task capabilities; however, the\nrepresentations generated by the merged encoder has to be re-aligned with the\ntask-specific heads; (2) the proposed architecture rivals traditional\nmulti-task learning in performance but requires fewer samples and training\nsteps by leveraging the existence of task-specific models.",

Recently, Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool to optimize resource allocation\npolicies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy\nthrough interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that\nindicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not\nsuitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore,\nexisting DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate\nthe desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead\nto undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we\npropose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the\nobjective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating\nexecution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function\ndirectly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the mean cycle time.\nMaximizing our reward function guarantees that the objective function is\nminimized without requiring extensive reward engineering. The results show that\nour method consistently learns the optimal policy in all six evaluated business\nprocesses, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithm that can only learn the\noptimal policy in two of the evaluated processes.",

To handle these issues, we propose the\never-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable,\nauto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic\nPolynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark\nfor LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which\nprovides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can\ngenerate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver:\nwhich provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both\nonline and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and\niii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze\nthe performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha\nmoments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments\nover widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the\nperformances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that\nNPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the\nmost powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\no1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of\ntokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and\nDeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem\ninstances become more and more difficult.

In this\npaper, we apply a logic-augmented generation (LAG) framework that leverages the\nexplicit representation of a text through a semantic knowledge graph and\napplies it in combination with prompt heuristics to elicit implicit analogical\nconnections. This method generates extended knowledge graph triples\nrepresenting implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled\nmultimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three\nmetaphor detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they\nrequire deep analogical reasoning capabilities. The results show that this\nintegrated approach surpasses current baselines, performs better than humans in\nunderstanding visual metaphors, and enables more explainable reasoning\nprocesses, though still has inherent limitations in metaphor understanding,\nespecially for domain-specific metaphors. Furthermore, we propose a thorough\nerror analysis, discussing issues with metaphorical annotations and current\nevaluation methods.",

This study comprehensively evaluated\nand compared the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of four newly developed\nreasoning-focused LLMs, namely DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0\nFlash-Thinking. Each model was assessed using 5,888 multiple-choice\nophthalmology exam questions from the MedMCQA dataset in zero-shot setting.\nQuantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation\nmetrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed\nagainst ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a\nsubset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified\nophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning\nstructure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and\nDeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in\nMacro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics\nvaried: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1\nand o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0\nFlash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and\no1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with\nDeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest\n(6.7 seconds).

Despite the impressive progress, the safety of LLM-based RecSys\nagainst backdoor attacks remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we\nraise a new problem: Can a backdoor with a specific trigger be injected into\nLLM-based Recsys, leading to the manipulation of the recommendation responses\nwhen the backdoor trigger is appended to an item's title? To investigate the\nvulnerabilities of LLM-based RecSys under backdoor attacks, we propose a new\nattack framework termed Backdoor Injection Poisoning for RecSys (BadRec).\nBadRec perturbs the items' titles with triggers and employs several fake users\nto interact with these items, effectively poisoning the training set and\ninjecting backdoors into LLM-based RecSys. Comprehensive experiments reveal\nthat poisoning just 1% of the training data with adversarial examples is\nsufficient to successfully implant backdoors, enabling manipulation of\nrecommendations. To further mitigate such a security threat, we propose a\nuniversal defense strategy called Poison Scanner (P-Scanner). Specifically, we\nintroduce an LLM-based poison scanner to detect the poisoned items by\nleveraging the powerful language understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. A\ntrigger augmentation agent is employed to generate diverse synthetic triggers\nto guide the poison scanner in learning domain-specific knowledge of the\npoisoned item detection task.

With the rise of social\nmedia platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly\nspreading through video content.

To establish this\nresult, we first demonstrate the strictly positive definiteness of the NTKs for\nmulti-layer FCNs and ResNets.

This behavior contrasts\nsharply with the lazy training regime commonly observed in regression problems.\nConsequently, using a proof by contradiction, we show that the empirical NTK\ndoes not uniformly converge to the NTK across all times on the training samples\nas the network width increases.

In this work, we position fusion depth, scalability, and\ndedicated multimodal capacity as primary factors for effective fusion. We\nintroduce DeepMLF, a novel multimodal language model (LM) with learnable tokens\ntailored toward deep fusion. DeepMLF leverages an audiovisual encoder and a\npretrained decoder LM augmented with multimodal information across its layers.\nWe append learnable tokens to the LM that: 1) capture modality interactions in\na controlled fashion and 2) preserve independent information flow for each\nmodality. These fusion tokens gather linguistic information via causal\nself-attention in LM Blocks and integrate with audiovisual information through\ncross-attention MM Blocks.

Our training recipe combines modality-specific losses and\nlanguage modelling loss, with the decoder LM tasked to predict ground truth\npolarity. Across three MSA benchmarks with varying dataset characteristics,\nDeepMLF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results confirm that deeper\nfusion leads to better performance, with optimal fusion depths (5-7) exceeding\nthose of existing approaches.

    "abstract": "Infants often exhibit goal-directed behaviors, such as reaching for a sensory\nstimulus, even when no external reward criterion is provided. These\nintrinsically motivated behaviors facilitate spontaneous exploration and\nlearning of the body and environment during early developmental stages.\nAlthough computational modeling can offer insight into the mechanisms\nunderlying such behaviors, many existing studies on intrinsic motivation focus\nprimarily on how exploration contributes to acquiring external rewards. In this\npaper, we propose a novel density model for an agent's own multimodal sensory\nexperiences, called the \"self-prior,\" and investigate whether it can\nautonomously induce goal-directed behavior. Integrated within an active\ninference framework based on the free energy principle, the self-prior\ngenerates behavioral references purely from an intrinsic process that minimizes\nmismatches between average past sensory experiences and current observations.\nThis mechanism is also analogous to the acquisition and utilization of a body\nschema through continuous interaction with the environment. We examine this\napproach in a simulated environment and confirm that the agent spontaneously\nreaches toward a tactile stimulus. Our study implements intrinsically motivated\nbehavior shaped by the agent's own sensory experiences, demonstrating the\nspontaneous emergence of intentional behavior during early development.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as mean absolute\nerror (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepancies between\npredictions and target values. However, these metrics do not directly evaluate\nthe physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly\ncritical concern in scientific and engineering applications.\n  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine\nlearning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system.\nAddressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine\nlearning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in\napplications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.\n  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting\nerror metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the\nunderlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed\ndynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse\npersistence ($\\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors --\ne.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity)\nand higher $\\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical\nconsistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that\nmeasure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\\theta$ versus their correct\nvalues. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and\nrecursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz,\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world\nweather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in\ndynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times\nor long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML\nforecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.",

    "abstract": "The emerging trend in computer vision emphasizes developing universal models\ncapable of simultaneously addressing multiple diverse tasks. Such universality\ntypically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure\neffective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents\nunique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets\nannotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical\nroad-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce\na novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current\npretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road\nenvironments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D\nobject detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D\ndetection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel\nframework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection\nvia weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing\nconsistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model\nachieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an\nindoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization\ncapabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D\nsignificantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through\neffective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for\nbroader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality\napplications.

However, these\ntechniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs\nand can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs.\nWhile prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods\nconfront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context\nchanges, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these\nissues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts\n(LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to\npreserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove\nredundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content.\nWe develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the\ncompression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key\ninformation. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external\nblack-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum\nlearning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training\nstrategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the\nDCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information\nintegrity.

The primary challenge is effectively fusing this visual and\ntextual information. Current cross-modal feature fusion approaches for CIR\nexhibit an inherent bias in intention interpretation. These methods tend to\ndisproportionately emphasize either the reference image features\n(visual-dominant fusion) or the textual modification intent (text-dominant\nfusion through image-to-text conversion). Such an imbalanced representation\noften fails to accurately capture and reflect the actual search intent of the\nuser in the retrieval results. To address this challenge, we propose TMCIR, a\nnovel framework that advances composed image retrieval through two key\ninnovations: 1) Intent-Aware Cross-Modal Alignment. We first fine-tune CLIP\nencoders contrastively using intent-reflecting pseudo-target images,\nsynthesized from reference images and textual descriptions via a diffusion\nmodel. This step enhances the encoder ability of text to capture nuanced\nintents in textual descriptions. 2) Adaptive Token Fusion. We further fine-tune\nall encoders contrastively by comparing adaptive token-fusion features with the\ntarget image. This mechanism dynamically balances visual and textual\nrepresentations within the contrastive learning pipeline, optimizing the\ncomposed feature for retrieval. Extensive experiments on Fashion-IQ and CIRR\ndatasets demonstrate that TMCIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, particularly in capturing nuanced user intent.",

    "abstract": "Subgraph counting the task of determining the number of instances of a query\npattern within a large graph lies at the heart of many critical applications,\nfrom analyzing financial networks and transportation systems to understanding\nbiological interactions. Despite decades of work yielding efficient algorithmic\n(AL) solutions and, more recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, a clear\ncomparative understanding is elusive. This gap stems from the absence of a\nunified evaluation framework, standardized datasets, and accessible ground\ntruths, all of which hinder systematic analysis and fair benchmarking. To\novercome these barriers, we introduce BEACON: a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to rigorously evaluate both AL and ML-based subgraph counting methods.\nBEACON provides a standardized dataset with verified ground truths, an\nintegrated evaluation environment, and a public leaderboard, enabling\nreproducible and transparent comparisons across diverse approaches. Our\nextensive experiments reveal that while AL methods excel in efficiently\ncounting subgraphs on very large graphs, they struggle with complex patterns\n(e.g., those exceeding six nodes). In contrast, ML methods are capable of\nhandling larger patterns but demand massive graph data inputs and often yield\nsuboptimal accuracy on small, dense graphs. These insights not only highlight\nthe unique strengths and limitations of each approach but also pave the way for\nfuture advancements in subgraph counting techniques. Overall, BEACON represents\na significant step towards unifying and accelerating research in subgraph\ncounting, encouraging innovative solutions and fostering a deeper understanding\nof the trade-offs between algorithmic and machine learning paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery traditionally relies on statistical methods applied to\nobservational data, often requiring large datasets and assumptions about\nunderlying causal structures. Recent advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for causal discovery by providing\ndomain expert knowledge.

In this work, we\nexplore the potential of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery by integrating\nobservational data for LLM-based reasoning. Specifically, we examine whether\nLLMs can effectively utilize observational data through two prompting\nstrategies: pairwise prompting and breadth first search (BFS)-based prompting.\nIn both approaches, we incorporate the observational data directly into the\nprompt to assess LLMs' ability to infer causal relationships from such data.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets show that incorporating observational data\nenhances causal discovery, boosting F1 scores by up to 0.11 point using both\npairwise and BFS LLM-based prompting, while outperforming traditional\nstatistical causal discovery baseline by up to 0.52 points. Our findings\nhighlight the potential and limitations of LLMs for data-driven causal\ndiscovery, demonstrating their ability to move beyond textual metadata and\neffectively interpret and utilize observational data for more informed causal\nreasoning.

To address these challenges, we\npropose GFSE, a universal graph structural encoder designed to capture\ntransferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as molecular\ngraphs, social networks, and citation networks.

This variant, called Hidden Query Extraction (HQE),\nhas a spectrum of industrial use-cases including query recovery, database\nsecurity, and vendor migration.

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, it is crucial to correctly interpret traffic gestures\n(TGs), such as those of an authority figure providing orders or instructions,\nor a pedestrian signaling the driver, to ensure a safe and pleasant traffic\nenvironment for all road users. This study investigates the capabilities of\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) in zero-shot interpretation,\nfocusing on their ability to caption and classify human gestures in traffic\ncontexts. We create and publicly share two custom datasets with varying formal\nand informal TGs, such as 'Stop', 'Reverse', 'Hail', etc. The datasets are\n\"Acted TG (ATG)\" and \"Instructive TG In-The-Wild (ITGI)\". They are annotated\nwith natural language, describing the pedestrian's body position and gesture.\nWe evaluate models using three methods utilizing expert-generated captions as\nbaseline and control: (1) caption similarity, (2) gesture classification, and\n(3) pose sequence reconstruction similarity. Results show that current VLMs\nstruggle with gesture understanding: sentence similarity averages below 0.59,\nand classification F1 scores reach only 0.14-0.39, well below the expert\nbaseline of 0.70. While pose reconstruction shows potential, it requires more\ndata and refined metrics to be reliable. Our findings reveal that although some\nSOTA VLMs can interpret zero-shot human traffic gestures, none are accurate and\nrobust enough to be trustworthy, emphasizing the need for further research in\nthis domain.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), powered by Transformers, have demonstrated\nhuman-like intelligence capabilities, yet their underlying mechanisms remain\npoorly understood. This paper presents a novel framework for interpreting LLMs\nas probabilistic left context-sensitive languages (CSLs) generators. We\nhypothesize that Transformers can be effectively decomposed into three\nfundamental components: context windows, attention mechanisms, and\nautoregressive generation frameworks. This decomposition allows for the\ndevelopment of more flexible and interpretable computational models, moving\nbeyond the traditional view of attention and autoregression as inseparable\nprocesses. We argue that next-token predictions can be understood as\nprobabilistic, dynamic approximations of left CSL production rules, providing\nan intuitive explanation for how simple token predictions can yield human-like\nintelligence outputs. Given that all CSLs are left context-sensitive\n(Penttonen, 1974), we conclude that Transformers stochastically approximate\nCSLs, which are widely recognized as models of human-like intelligence. This\ninterpretation bridges the gap between Formal Language Theory and the observed\ngenerative power of Transformers, laying a foundation for future advancements\nin generative AI theory and applications. Our novel perspective on Transformer\narchitectures will foster a deeper understanding of LLMs and their future\npotentials.",

Names also serve as powerful signals of\ngender, race, and status in the social hierarchy - a pecking order in which\nindividual positions shape others' expectations on their perceived competence\nand worth. With the widespread adoption of LLMs and as names are often an input\nfor LLMs, it is crucial to evaluate whether LLMs may sort people into status\npositions based on first and last names and, if so, whether it is in an unfair,\nbiased fashion. While prior work has primarily investigated biases in first\nnames, little attention has been paid to last names and even less to the\ncombined effects of first and last names. In this study, we conduct a\nlarge-scale analysis of name variations across 5 ethnicities to examine how AI\nexhibits name biases. Our study investigates three key characteristics of\ninequality and finds that LLMs reflect and reinforce status hierarchies based\non names that signal gender and ethnicity as they encode differential\nexpectations of competence, leadership, and economic potential. Contrary to the\ncommon assumption that AI tends to favor Whites, we show that East and, in some\ncontexts, South Asian names receive higher rankings. We also disaggregate\nAsians, a population projected to be the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by\n2055. Our results challenge the monolithic Asian model minority assumption,\nillustrating a more complex and stratified model of bias. Gender moderates\nbiases, with girls facing unfair disadvantages in certain racial groups.\nAdditionally, spanning cultural categories by adopting Western first names\nimproves AI-perceived status for East and Southeast Asian students,\nparticularly for girls. Our findings underscore the importance of\nintersectional and more nuanced understandings of race, gender, and mixed\nidentities in the evaluation of LLMs.",

Using 51 tests drawn from\nsix clinical and experimental batteries, we characterise the visual abilities\nof leading VLMs relative to normative performance in healthy adults. While the\nmodels excel in straightforward object recognition tasks, we find widespread\ndeficits in low- and mid-level visual abilities that would be considered\nclinically significant in humans. These selective deficits, profiled through\nvalidated test batteries, suggest that an artificial system can achieve complex\nobject recognition without developing foundational visual concepts that in\nhumans require no explicit training.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems deployed on edge devices face significant challenges,\nincluding resource constraints, real-time processing demands, and adapting to\ndynamic environments. This work introduces ATLASv2, a novel system that\nintegrates a fine-tuned TinyLLM, real-time object detection, and efficient path\nplanning to enable hierarchical, multi-task navigation and manipulation all on\nthe edge device, Jetson Nano. ATLASv2 dynamically expands its navigable\nlandmarks by detecting and localizing objects in the environment which are\nsaved to its internal knowledge base to be used for future task execution. We\nevaluate ATLASv2 in real-world environments, including a handcrafted home and\noffice setting constructed with diverse objects and landmarks. Results show\nthat ATLASv2 effectively interprets natural language instructions, decomposes\nthem into low-level actions, and executes tasks with high success rates. By\nleveraging generative AI in a fully on-board framework, ATLASv2 achieves\noptimized resource utilization with minimal prompting latency and power\nconsumption, bridging the gap between simulated environments and real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The classical limit of quantum mechanics, formally investigated through\nframeworks like strict deformation quantization, remains a profound area of\ninquiry in the philosophy of physics. This paper explores a computational\napproach employing a neural network to emulate the emergence of classical\nbehavior from the quantum harmonic oscillator as Planck's constant $\\hbar$\napproaches zero. We develop and train a neural network architecture to learn\nthe mapping from initial expectation values and $\\hbar$ to the time evolution\nof the expectation value of position. By analyzing the network's predictions\nacross different regimes of hbar, we aim to provide computational insights into\nthe nature of the quantum-classical transition. This work demonstrates the\npotential of machine learning as a complementary tool for exploring\nfoundational questions in quantum mechanics and its classical limit.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the thin-slicing approach - the ability to make accurate\njudgments based on minimal information - in the context of scientific\npresentations. Drawing on research from nonverbal communication and personality\npsychology, we show that brief excerpts (thin slices) reliably predict overall\npresentation quality. Using a novel corpus of over one hundred real-life\nscience talks, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate transcripts\nof full presentations and their thin slices. By correlating LLM-based\nevaluations of short excerpts with full-talk assessments, we determine how much\ninformation is needed for accurate predictions. Our results demonstrate that\nLLM-based evaluations align closely with human ratings, proving their validity,\nreliability, and efficiency. Critically, even very short excerpts (less than 10\npercent of a talk) strongly predict overall evaluations. This suggests that the\nfirst moments of a presentation convey relevant information that is used in\nquality evaluations and can shape lasting impressions. The findings are robust\nacross different LLMs and prompting strategies. This work extends thin-slicing\nresearch to public speaking and connects theories of impression formation to\nLLMs and current research on AI communication. We discuss implications for\ncommunication and social cognition research on message reception. Lastly, we\nsuggest an LLM-based thin-slicing framework as a scalable feedback tool to\nenhance human communication.",

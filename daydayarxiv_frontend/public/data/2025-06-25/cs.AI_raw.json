    "abstract": "In this paper, we reveal a significant shortcoming in class unlearning evaluations: overlooking the underlying class geometry can cause privacy leakage. We further propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate this issue. We introduce a membership-inference attack via nearest neighbors (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities the model assigns to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples. Our experiments show that existing unlearning methods are vulnerable to MIA-NN across multiple datasets. We then propose a new fine-tuning objective that mitigates this privacy leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over the remaining classes that a retrained-from-scratch model would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting (TRW) distribution serves as the desired distribution during fine-tuning. We also show that across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior unlearning metrics. More specifically, on CIFAR-10, it reduces the gap with retrained models by 19% and 46% for U-LiRA and MIA-NN scores, accordingly, compared to the SOTA method for each category.",

These powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and MI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.",

However, the security implications of this setup remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy, demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust prompt learning in future federated systems.",

    "abstract": "Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods.",

This implicit learning often overlooks explicit monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3) equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will appear in a future revision.",

    "abstract": "As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public health decision-making.",

Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components: semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition. We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.",

MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context.

These techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses, limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations (responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation processes.",

However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show great promise for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly in IoT environments, but suffer performance degradation due to distribution drift and lack robustness against realistic adversarial attacks. Current robustness evaluations often rely on unrealistic synthetic perturbations and lack demonstrations on systematic analysis of different kinds of adversarial attack, which encompass both black-box and white-box scenarios. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance GNN robustness and generalization by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) in an agentic pipeline as simulated cybersecurity expert agents. These agents scrutinize graph structures derived from network flow data, identifying and potentially mitigating suspicious or adversarially perturbed elements before GNN processing. Our experiments, using a framework designed for realistic evaluation and testing with a variety of adversarial attacks including a dataset collected from physical testbed experiments, demonstrate that integrating LLM analysis can significantly improve the resilience of GNN-based NIDS against challenges, showcasing the potential of LLM agent as a complementary layer in intrusion detection architectures.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should also result in better research after being executed. To test whether AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas, either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100 hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement, effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas in the absence of execution outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Stochastic Parameter Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd/tree/spd-paper.",

The dynamic nature of ML development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data, poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their flexibility and incremental delivery, seem well-suited to address this dynamism. However, it is unclear how to effectively apply these methods in the context of ML-enabled systems, where challenges require tailored approaches. [Goal] Our goal is to outline the state of the art in agile management for ML-enabled systems. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with backward and forward snowballing iterations. [Results] Our study identified 27 papers published between 2008 and 2024. From these, we identified eight frameworks and categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field.

    "abstract": "Chatbots are increasingly integrated into people's lives and are widely used to help people. Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse direction-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better chatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However, little research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots. To address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) framework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like identity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human empathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and intentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial behaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which chatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the reasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and intentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and emotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and intention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative analysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial behaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding and promoting human prosocial behaviors toward chatbots.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158 real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\\% and 43.6\\% of the time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in 59.9\\% and 50.5\\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions. Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\\% of scenarios. These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.",

We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench.

    "abstract": "The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.",

    "abstract": "Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.",

In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal accounts of such trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. Here we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models' default behavior, and demonstrate that these patterns shift in predictable ways when models are prompted to prioritize certain goals over others. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. Our framework offers a flexible tool for probing value trade-offs across diverse model types, providing insights for generating hypotheses about other social behaviors such as sycophancy and for shaping training regimes that better control trade-offs between values during model development.",

Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason about the \"mental\" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing interactive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities. Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and paves the path towards better artificial agents.",

Modern acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods.

Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains (plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.",

However, existing agents typically operate in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader research community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute by sharing knowledge.

Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, an multi-agent system designed to actively integrate external knowledge. CoMind employs an iterative parallel exploration mechanism, developing multiple solutions simultaneously to balance exploratory breadth with implementation depth. On 75 past Kaggle competitions within our MLE-Live framework, CoMind achieves a 36% medal rate, establishing a new state of the art. Critically, when deployed in eight live, ongoing competitions, CoMind outperforms 92.6% of human competitors on average, placing in the top 5% on three official leaderboards and the top 1% on one.",

Traditional ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption. [Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns, aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity, though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to adopt Define-ML.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies (WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.",

    "abstract": "The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data (mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices, significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to first responders.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.",

Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities",

Through a randomized control trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall.

    "abstract": "Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within two stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization\" stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We particularly focus on the ``summarization\" stage, and propose a framework that effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization. We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.",

However, a critical gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application, particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field. Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a foundation for developing robust defenses.",

Considering that the generated sentences contain rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features. Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for dense video captioning.",

    "abstract": "For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\\bar D^*Ξ_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/ψΛ_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body physics.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or ``deepfakes\", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects\" introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules: Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26 datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the ``block effect\" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust solution for open-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual, multi-task setting.\n  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages. We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0 improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented languages.",

    "abstract": "Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making. However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior. Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent driving systems.",

SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.",

Existing geospatial representation learning approaches typically aggregate Points of Interest(POI) into pre-defined administrative regions such as census units or ZIP code areas, assigning a single embedding to each region. However, POIs often form semantically meaningful groups that extend across, within, or beyond these boundaries, defining places that better reflect human activity and urban function. To address this limitation, we propose PlaceRep, a training-free geospatial representation learning method that constructs place-level representations by clustering spatially and semantically related POIs. PlaceRep summarizes large-scale POI graphs from U.S. Foursquare data to produce general-purpose urban region embeddings while automatically identifying places across multiple spatial scales. By eliminating model pre-training, PlaceRep provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-granular geospatial analysis. Experiments using the tasks of population density estimation and housing price prediction as downstream tasks show that PlaceRep outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based geospatial representation learning methods and achieves up to a 100x speedup in generating region-level representations on large-scale POI graphs.

    "abstract": "Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL), especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance, while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen. We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens (i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).",

Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.\n  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological processes.\n  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical systems and studying self-growth processes.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10. Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by self-influence alone.",

We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation space.

Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings, powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability.

This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.\n  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements.

In e-commerce recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator named \\textit{\\textbf{O}ff-\\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \\textbf{F}uture \\textbf{V}alue (\\textbf{\\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example, seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data. Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under non-stationarity for various experimental setups.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that showcase its applicability and efficacy.",

However, enabling effective personalized learning in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models, maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices, where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of overhead.",

Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology - allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that actively support the energy grid.",

To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.\n  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting. These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in collaborative settings.",

    "abstract": "Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future efforts by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in several iEEG tasks. MVPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer baselines in seizure detection across the SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA datasets, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on four Brain TreeBank iEEG decoding tasks. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds the performance of existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with SOTA clinical performance.

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix, which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model compression ratios.",

    "abstract": "Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis; it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time, hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D, AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained action dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the biomechanical behavior of the myocardium is crucial for understanding cardiac physiology, but cannot be directly inferred from clinical imaging and typically requires finite element (FE) simulations. However, conventional FE methods are computationally expensive and often fail to reproduce observed cardiac motions. We propose IMC-PINN-FE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that integrates imaged motion consistency (IMC) with FE modeling for patient-specific left ventricular (LV) biomechanics. Cardiac motion is first estimated from MRI or echocardiography using either a pre-trained attention-based network or an unsupervised cyclic-regularized network, followed by extraction of motion modes. IMC-PINN-FE then rapidly estimates myocardial stiffness and active tension by fitting clinical pressure measurements, accelerating computation from hours to seconds compared to traditional inverse FE. Based on these parameters, it performs FE modeling across the cardiac cycle at 75x speedup. Through motion constraints, it matches imaged displacements more accurately, improving average Dice from 0.849 to 0.927, while preserving realistic pressure-volume behavior. IMC-PINN-FE advances previous PINN-FE models by introducing back-computation of material properties and better motion fidelity. Using motion from a single subject to reconstruct shape modes also avoids the need for large datasets and improves patient specificity. IMC-PINN-FE offers a robust and efficient approach for rapid, personalized, and image-consistent cardiac biomechanical modeling.",

However, existing research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories.

In practice, it is often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover, it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration (ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and (2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random recurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to these working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries benchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five categories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five categories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification and anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term forecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for time-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to transformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations and sensitive event detection.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.\n  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified solving approach achieves a $9\\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\\times$ speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\\%$ and $86\\%$ of the qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only $62\\%$ and $4\\%$ of the queries, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs. Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e., the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)",

In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under challenging evaluation scenarios.

Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation), generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach; new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\\sim$350M parameters) with a narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\\sim$86\\% percentage point improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective autonomous discovery systems.",

Notably, their activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE) discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from microscopic data.",

User simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS, but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores. RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse, controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning (ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data. Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time. Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD). Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.",

We introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL) models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations, n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation, though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular prosody.",

First, we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning integration in LLMs.",

We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features can improve the performance of directed link prediction.

    "abstract": "In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals, this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models, more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity present in the texts.

While the community has largely addressed this issue from a label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point, quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train models with the same configuration using both the original data and priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing datasets.",

However, well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module (PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models, depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include: (1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2) the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text. However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance, which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information, we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance, especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite imagery data.",

While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.",

Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism.

The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.",

    "abstract": "The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces \"Insight Recall,\" a novel paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal \"insights.\" Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional \"Guided Inquiry\" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that enhance metacognition and self-regulation.",

To bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed, RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations, dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern code-generation systems.",

    "abstract": "Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices. This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks. The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network FLOPs by 52\\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces FLOPs by more than 42\\% with a negligible 0.33\\% drop in top-5 accuracy.

However, removing undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation (WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark, Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility preservation.

    "abstract": "RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information. However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these \"gambling-like\" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG) framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments. Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like behaviors: 18.7\\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\\% reduction in loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse scenarios.

Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust. Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models.

    "abstract": "The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline, MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities, covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded in the real world.

    "abstract": "Industrial carbon emissions are a major driver of climate change, yet modeling these emissions is challenging due to multicollinearity among factors and complex interdependencies across sectors and time. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission \"hotspots\" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.",

However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR (ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\\% of the best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable performance on the other three datasets.",

However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce DiceHuBERT, a knowledge distillation framework for compressing HuBERT, a widely used self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech foundation model. Unlike existing distillation methods that rely on layer-wise and feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear advantage.",

    "abstract": "Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.",

Existing training-data influence estimators such as TracIn yield a single scalar score that aggregates over all loop iterations, obscuring when during the recurrent computation a training example matters. We introduce \\textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$τ$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reasoning tasks show that SDI scales excellently, matches full-gradient baselines with low error and supports a broad range of data attribution and interpretability tasks with per-step insights into the latent reasoning process.",

    "abstract": "Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.",

However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

    "abstract": "Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in foundational models have yielded reasoning systems capable of achieving a gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest quantifying standard levels of autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results, as well as propose a novel concept of human-AI interaction cards for transparency. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics and share all prompts as well as model outputs at https://github.com/google-deepmind/superhuman/tree/main/aletheia.",

We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 9 broad domains with 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\\uparrow 13.43\\%$ in training-free settings and $\\uparrow 42.12\\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \\& figure analysis.

    "abstract": "Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient, biologically plausible computation but suffer from non-differentiable spike generation, necessitating reliance on heuristic surrogate gradients. This paper introduces UltraLIF, a principled framework that replaces surrogate gradients with ultradiscretization, a mathematical formalism from tropical geometry providing continuous relaxations of discrete dynamics. The central insight is that the max-plus semiring underlying ultradiscretization naturally models neural threshold dynamics: the log-sum-exp function serves as a differentiable soft-maximum that converges to hard thresholding as a learnable temperature parameter $\\eps \\to 0$. Two neuron models are derived from distinct dynamical systems: UltraLIF from the LIF ordinary differential equation (temporal dynamics) and UltraDLIF from the diffusion equation modeling gap junction coupling across neuronal populations (spatial dynamics). Both yield fully differentiable SNNs trainable via standard backpropagation with no forward-backward mismatch. Theoretical analysis establishes pointwise convergence to classical LIF dynamics with quantitative error bounds and bounded non-vanishing gradients. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning static images, neuromorphic vision, and audio demonstrate improvements over surrogate gradient baselines, with gains most pronounced in single-timestep ($T{=}1$) settings on neuromorphic and temporal datasets. An optional sparsity penalty enables significant energy reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy.",

In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone technique for developing reasoning models in complex tasks, ranging from mathematical problem-solving to imaginary reasoning. The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.",

    "abstract": "Deriving predictable scaling laws that govern the relationship between model performance and computational investment is crucial for designing and allocating resources in massive-scale recommendation systems. While such laws are established for large language models, they remain challenging for recommendation systems, especially those processing both user history and context features. We identify poor scaling efficiency as the main barrier to predictable power-law scaling, stemming from inefficient modules with low Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and suboptimal resource allocation. We introduce Kunlun, a scalable architecture that systematically improves model efficiency and resource allocation. Our low-level optimizations include Generalized Dot-Product Attention (GDPA), Hierarchical Seed Pooling (HSP), and Sliding Window Attention. Our high-level innovations feature Computation Skip (CompSkip) and Event-level Personalization. These advances increase MFU from 17% to 37% on NVIDIA B200 GPUs and double scaling efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. Kunlun is now deployed in major Meta Ads models, delivering significant production impact.",

    "abstract": "Temporally locating and classifying fine-grained sub-task segments in long, untrimmed videos is crucial to safe human-robot collaboration. Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%). These results demonstrate a practical path from sub-task level video understanding to deployed robotic manipulation in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents embedded in environments with physics-based interaction face many challenges including reasoning, planning, summarization, and question answering. This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Lane changing in dense traffic is a significant challenge for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic.

We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization.

According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.",

Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.",

Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned. Taken together, these results show that small, subtle edits to training data can systematically shape model behavior, underscoring the importance of training data interpretability for adversaries and defenders alike.

In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities.",

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.",

Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.",

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.",

While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific \"vascular fingerprint\" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision support requires not only correct answers but also clinically valid reasoning. We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.",

    "abstract": "Robots often struggle to follow free-form human instructions in real-world settings due to computational and sensing limitations. We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings.",

    "abstract": "Failures in large-scale cloud systems incur substantial financial losses, making automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) essential for operational stability. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.",

Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.",

    "abstract": "Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.",

    "abstract": "Running LLMs with extended reasoning on every problem is expensive, but determining which inputs actually require additional compute remains challenging. We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

The variability in the 3D Morphable models can be controlled by tuning diverse parameters. They are high-level image descriptors, such as shape, texture, illumination, and camera parameters. Previous research in 3D human reconstruction concentrated solely on global face structure or geometry, ignoring face semantic features such as age, gender, and facial landmarks characterizing facial boundaries, curves, dips, and wrinkles. In order to accommodate changes in these high-level facial characteristics, this work introduces a shape and appearance-aware 3D reconstruction system (named SARS by us), a c modular pipeline that extracts body and face information from a single image to properly rebuild the 3D model of the human full body.",

By integrating 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with flow matching, we effectively represent high-dimensional cosmological structures. The Wavelet Transform addresses the ``void problem'' by translating spatial emptiness into spectral sparsity. It decouples high-frequency details from low-frequency structures through spatial compression, and wavelet-space velocity fields facilitate stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers with large step sizes. Using large-scale cosmological $N$-body simulations, at $128^3$ resolution, we achieve up to $50\\times$ faster sampling than diffusion models, combining a $10\\times$ reduction in integration steps with lower per-step computational cost from wavelet compression. Our results enable initial conditions to be sampled in seconds, compared to minutes for previous methods.",

    "abstract": "College students increasingly use AI chatbots to support academic reading, yet we lack granular understanding of how these interactions shape their reading experience and cognitive engagement. We conducted an eight-week longitudinal study with 15 undergraduates who used AI to support assigned readings in a course. We collected 838 prompts across 239 reading sessions and developed a coding schema categorizing prompts into four cognitive themes: Decoding, Comprehension, Reasoning, and Metacognition. Comprehension prompts dominated (59.6%), with Reasoning (29.8%), Metacognition (8.5%), and Decoding (2.1%) less frequent. Most sessions (72%) contained exactly three prompts, the required minimum of the reading assignment. Within sessions, students showed natural cognitive progression from comprehension toward reasoning, but this progression was truncated. Across eight weeks, students' engagement patterns remained stable, with substantial individual differences persisting throughout. Qualitative analysis revealed an intention-behavior gap: students recognized that effective prompting required effort but rarely applied this knowledge, with efficiency emerging as the primary driver. Students also strategically triaged their engagement based on interest and academic pressures, exhibiting a novel pattern of reading through AI rather than with it: using AI-generated summaries as primary material to filter which sections merited deeper attention. We discuss design implications for AI reading systems that scaffold sustained cognitive engagement.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate the trade-offs between performance and costs, LLM providers route user tasks to different models based on task difficulty and latency. We study the effect of LLM routing with respect to user behavior. We propose a game between an LLM provider with two models (standard and reasoning) and a user who can re-prompt or abandon tasks if the routed model cannot solve them. The user's goal is to maximize their utility minus the delay from using the model, while the provider minimizes the cost of servicing the user. We solve this Stackelberg game by fully characterizing the user best response and simplifying the provider problem. We observe that in nearly all cases, the optimal routing policy involves a static policy with no cascading that depends on the expected utility of the models to the user. Furthermore, we reveal a misalignment gap between the provider-optimal and user-preferred routes when the user's and provider's rankings of the models with respect to utility and cost differ. Finally, we demonstrate conditions for extreme misalignment where providers are incentivized to throttle the latency of the models to minimize their costs, consequently depressing user utility. The results yield simple threshold rules for single-provider, single-user interactions and clarify when routing, cascading, and throttling help or harm.",

We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy).

To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation.

To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

    "abstract": "The convergence of AI and 6G network automation introduces new challenges in maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability across multivendor management systems. Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\\%) and ERM (21.5\\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks.",

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) has emerged as a promising approach to developing general-purpose agents through automated curriculum generation. Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning is often motivated by improved stability and reduced training cost, but it can also fail under substantial domain shift. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.",

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.",

We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in programming tasks, LLM-driven coding systems have evolved from one-shot code generation into complex systems capable of iterative improvement during inference. However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone. EvoCodeBench establishes a foundation for evaluating coding intelligence in evolving LLM-driven systems.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a Symbolic Pattern Planning (SPP) approach was proposed for numeric planning where a pattern (i.e., a finite sequence of actions) suggests a causal order between actions. The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been shown to significantly improve the reasoning accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.",

Here, we introduce EVA, the first cross-species, multimodal foundation model of immunology and inflammation, a therapeutic area where shared pathogenic mechanisms create unique opportunities for transfer learning. EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations. We establish clear scaling laws, demonstrating that increasing model size and compute translates to improvements in both pretraining and downstream tasks performance. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite of 39 tasks spanning the drug development pipeline: zero-shot target efficacy and gene function prediction for discovery, cross-species or cross-diseases molecular perturbations for preclinical development, and patient stratification with treatment response prediction or disease activity prediction for clinical trials applications. We benchmark EVA against several state-of-the-art biological foundation models and baselines on these tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each task category. Using mechanistic interpretability, we further identify biological meaningful features, revealing intertwined representations across species and technologies.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks.",

At inference, synthetic masks are obtained by decoding denoised latent vectors through the frozen VAE decoder, with optional coarse control over lesion presence via a binary prompt.\n  Qualitative results show that the generated masks preserve global brain anatomy, discrete tissue semantics, and realistic variability, while avoiding the structural artifacts commonly observed in pixel-space generative models.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has been able to solve various tasks successfully, however, due to the construction of policy gradient and training dynamics, tuning deep reinforcement learning models remains challenging. As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO). Compared with PPO and some other state-of-the-art variants, we demonstrate an improved performance of ExO-PPO with balanced sample efficiency and stability on varied tasks in the empirical experiments.",

However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.",

We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

In the presence of concept drift, class imbalance, label scarcity, and new class emergence, they jointly degrade representation stability, bias learning toward outdated distributions, and reduce the resilience and reliability of detection in dynamic environments. This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts. Our results demonstrate that SCIL outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Based on our commitment to Open Science, we make our code and datasets available to the community.",

    "abstract": "Since 1887, administrative law has navigated a \"capability-accountability trap\": technological change forces government to become more sophisticated, but sophistication renders agencies opaque to generalist overseers like the courts and Congress. The law's response--substituting procedural review for substantive oversight--has produced a sedimentary accretion of requirements that ossify capacity without ensuring democratic control. This Article argues that the Supreme Court's post-Loper Bright retrenchment is best understood as an effort to shrink administration back to comprehensible size in response to this complexification. But reducing complexity in this way sacrifices capability precisely when climate change, pandemics, and AI risks demand more sophisticated governance.\n  AI offers a different path. Unlike many prior administrative technologies that increased opacity alongside capacity, AI can help build \"scrutability\" in government, translating technical complexity into accessible terms, surfacing the assumptions that matter for oversight, and enabling substantive verification of agency reasoning. This Article proposes three doctrinal innovations within administrative law to realize this potential: a Model and System Dossier (documenting model purpose, evaluation, monitoring, and versioning) extending the administrative record to AI decision-making; a material-model-change trigger specifying when AI updates require new process; and a \"deference to audit\" standard that rewards agencies for auditable evaluation of their AI tools. The result is a framework for what this Article calls the \"Fourth Settlement,\" administrative law that escapes the capability-accountability trap by preserving capability while restoring comprehensible oversight of administration.",

Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision.

MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, yet these defenses remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts. While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}.\n  To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.\n  Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.\n  Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\\%) and Gemini (59.5\\%).\n  These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques. The Four-Checkpoint Framework provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing safety vulnerabilities in deployed systems.",

The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.",

Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation.

We show that neural retrievers used in RAG systems have blind spots, which we define as the failure to retrieve entities that are relevant to the query, but have low similarity to the query embedding. We investigate the training-induced biases that cause such blind spot entities to be mapped to inaccessible parts of the embedding space, resulting in low retrievability. Using a large-scale dataset constructed from Wikidata relations and first paragraphs of Wikipedia, and our proposed Retrieval Probability Score (RPS), we show that blind spot risk in standard retrievers (e.g., CONTRIEVER, REASONIR) can be predicted pre-index from entity embedding geometry, avoiding expensive retrieval evaluations. To address these blind spots, we introduce ARGUS, a pipeline that enables the retrievability of high-risk (low-RPS) entities through targeted document augmentation from a knowledge base (KB), first paragraphs of Wikipedia, in our case. Extensive experiments on BRIGHT, IMPLIRET, and RAR-B show that ARGUS achieves consistent improvements across all evaluated retrievers (averaging +3.4 nDCG@5 and +4.5 nDCG@10 absolute points), with substantially larger gains in challenging subsets. These results establish that preemptively remedying blind spots is critical for building robust and trustworthy RAG systems (Code and Data).",

    "abstract": "Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.",

    "abstract": "Correctly detecting radar targets is usually challenged by clutter and waveform distortion. An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.",

We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation.

    "abstract": "A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities.",

We provide a theoretical analysis showing that entropy control increases the expected log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples in favor of the in-distribution, and we explain why the procedure works without any additional training of the density model. We then evaluate our method against likelihood-based OOD detectors on standard benchmarks and find consistent AUROC improvements over baselines, supporting our explanation.",

Typically powered by machine learning methods, predictive models are used in recommendations, financial fraud detection, supply chain optimization, and other systems, providing billions of predictions every day. However, training a machine learning model requires manual work to extract the required training examples - prediction entities and target labels - from the database, which is slow, laborious, and prone to mistakes. Here, we present the Predictive Query Language (PQL), a SQL-inspired declarative language for defining predictive tasks on relational databases. PQL allows specifying a predictive task in a single declarative query, enabling the automatic computation training labels for a large variety of machine learning tasks, such as regression, classification, time-series forecasting, and recommender systems. PQL is already successfully integrated and used in a collection of use cases as part of a predictive AI platform. The versatility of the language can be demonstrated through its many ongoing use cases, including financial fraud, item recommendations, and workload prediction. We demonstrate its versatile design through two implementations; one for small-scale, low-latency use and one that can handle large-scale databases.",

Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the \"black-box\" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward \"white-box\" cardiac diagnostics.",

A paired knowledge-probing experiment suggests the bottleneck is architectural rather than epistemic: four frontier LLMs reason about peptides at levels comparable to small molecules, yet no framework exposes this capability.

Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs.",

The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines.

Goal-aware prompting shifts intermediate measures toward the disclosed downstream objective. This purpose leakage improves performance before the LLM's knowledge cutoff, but with no advantage post-cutoff.

    "abstract": "The widespread use of publicly available pre-trained encoders from self-supervised learning (SSL) has exposed a critical vulnerability: their susceptibility to downstream-agnostic adversarial examples (DAEs), which are crafted without knowledge of the downstream tasks but capable of misleading downstream models. While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property.",

We further propose a proxy-based, cost-efficient strategy for batch size tuning, revealing the impact of rank, dataset size, and model capacity on the optimal batch size. Our findings elevate batch size from a minor implementation detail to a first-order design parameter, reconciling prior inconsistencies and enabling more reliable evaluations of LoRA variants.",

    "abstract": "Shapley values have become a cornerstone of explainable AI, but they are computationally expensive to use, especially when features are dependent. Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.",

    "abstract": "Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.",

However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness.",

We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each.

Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating hallucinations while delivering precise and verifiable geo-localization.",

We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development.",

This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones.

    "abstract": "The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks. By open-sourcing P1-VL, we provide a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence to better align visual perceptions with abstract physical laws for machine scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "Social biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) raise significant fairness concerns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.",

    "abstract": "With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to the proliferation of unauthorized derivative models. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence systems evolve from passive assistants into autonomous agents capable of executing consequential actions, the security boundary shifts from model outputs to tool execution. Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability.",

    "abstract": "Robotic laboratories play a critical role in autonomous scientific discovery by enabling scalable, continuous experimental execution. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories.",

    "abstract": "While the proliferation of foundation models has significantly boosted individual productivity, it also introduces a potential challenge: the homogenization of creative content. In response, we revisit Design-by-Analogy (DbA), a cognitively grounded approach that fosters novel solutions by mapping inspiration across domains. However, prevailing perspectives often restrict DbA to early ideation or specific data modalities, while reducing AI-driven design to simplified input-output pipelines. Such conceptual limitations inadvertently foster widespread design fixation. To address this, we expand the understanding of DbA by embedding it into the entire creative process, thereby demonstrating its capacity to mitigate such fixation. Through a systematic review of 85 studies, we identify six forms of representation and classify techniques across seven stages of the creative process. We further discuss three major application domains: creative industries, intelligent manufacturing, and education and services, demonstrating DbA's practical relevance. Building on this synthesis, we frame DbA as a mediating technology for human-AI collaboration and outline the potential opportunities and inherent risks for advancing creativity support in HCI and design research.",

Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.",

Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.",

We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs.",

While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines. Latent-space analysis, including t-SNE visualizations and effective-rank measurements, confirms that our method learns significantly richer representations, bridging the performance gap caused by the absence of a replay buffer, while remaining efficient enough to train on just a few CPU cores.",

We establish an information-theoretic barrier to this credit assignment problem: the signal connecting early steps to final outcomes decays exponentially with depth, creating a critical horizon beyond which reliable learning from endpoint data alone requires exponentially many samples. We prove four results. First, a Signal Decay Bound: sample complexity for attributing outcomes to early stages grows exponentially in the number of intervening steps. Second, Width Limits: parallel rollouts provide only logarithmic relief, with correlation capping the effective number of independent samples. Third, an Objective Mismatch: additive reward aggregation optimizes the wrong quantity when sequential validity requires all steps to be correct. Fourth, Optimal Inspection Design: uniform checkpoint spacing is minimax-optimal under homogeneous signal attenuation, while a greedy algorithm yields optimal non-uniform schedules under heterogeneous attenuation. Together, these results provide a common analytical foundation for inspection design in operations and supervision design in AI.",

Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further.",

    "abstract": "Discovering configurations that are both high-utility and structurally diverse under expensive black-box evaluation and strict query budgets remains a central challenge in data-driven discovery. Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery.",

    "abstract": "Encryption has been commonly used in network traffic to secure transmission, but it also brings challenges for malicious traffic detection, due to the invisibility of the packet payload. Graph-based methods are emerging as promising solutions by leveraging multi-host interactions to promote detection accuracy. But most of them face a critical problem: Graph Drift, where the flow statistics or topological information of a graph change over time. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a graph-assisted encrypted traffic detection system, MalMoE, which applies Mixture of Experts (MoE) to select the best expert model for drift-aware classification. Particularly, we design 1-hop-GNN-like expert models that handle different graph drifts by analyzing graphs with different features. Then, the redesigned gate model conducts expert selection according to the actual drift. MalMoE is trained with a stable two-stage training strategy with data augmentation, which effectively guides the gate on how to perform routing. Experiments on open-source, synthetic, and real-world datasets show that MalMoE can perform precise and real-time detection.",

AI has proven an excellent tool for reconstructing and enhancing images that appear sharper, smoother, and more detailed, can be acquired more quickly, and allowing clinicians to review them more rapidly. However, incorporation of AI also introduces new failure modes and can exacerbate the disconnect between perceived quality of an image and information content of that image. Understanding the limitations of AI-enabled image reconstruction and enhancement is critical for safe and effective use of the technology. Hence, the purpose of this communication is to bring awareness to limitations when AI is used to reconstruct or enhance a radiological image, with the goal of enabling users to reap benefits of the technology while minimizing risks.",

    "abstract": "AI agents are increasingly deployed in multi-tenant cloud environments, where they execute diverse tool calls within sandboxed containers, each call with distinct resource demands and rapid fluctuations. We present a systematic characterization of OS-level resource dynamics in sandboxed AI coding agents, analyzing 144 software engineering tasks from the SWE-rebench benchmark across two LLM models. Our measurements reveal that (1) OS-level execution (tool calls, container and agent initialization) accounts for 56-74% of end-to-end task latency; (2) memory, not CPU, is the concurrency bottleneck; (3) memory spikes are tool-call-driven with a up to 15.4x peak-to-average ratio; and (4) resource demands are highly unpredictable across tasks, runs, and models. Comparing these characteristics against serverless, microservice, and batch workloads, we identify three mismatches in existing resource controls: a granularity mismatch (container-level policies vs. tool-call-level dynamics), a responsiveness mismatch (user-space reaction vs. sub-second unpredictable bursts), and an adaptability mismatch (history-based prediction vs. non-deterministic stateful execution). We propose AgentCgroup , an eBPF-based resource controller that addresses these mismatches through hierarchical cgroup structures aligned with tool-call boundaries, in-kernel enforcement via sched_ext and memcg_bpf_ops, and runtime-adaptive policies driven by in-kernel monitoring. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates improved multi-tenant isolation and reduced resource waste.",

We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors. AgentAuditor is agnostic to MAS setting, and we find across 5 popular settings that it yields up to 5% absolute accuracy improvement over a majority vote, and up to 3% over using LLM-as-Judge.",

To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities, we demonstrate that our proposed PLs-based diversity metric (PLDiv) is powerful, reliable, and interpretable, directly linking data diversity to its underlying geometry and offering a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation.",

In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy of Kyrtos' recognition and analysis methods by measuring the structural similarity between input chart curves and the approximations generated by Kyrtos for charts with multiple functions.",

Our method requires no auxiliary models or external annotation, instead importance is estimated directly from the policy model's own probability shifts. Experiments on GSM8K across three models spanning the Qwen and Llama families demonstrate consistent improvements over uniform baselines and faster convergence to equivalent accuracy. Inverting the importance signal hurts performance, confirming we capture genuine causal structure rather than noise. Analysis shows the method correctly prioritizes calculation steps over scaffolding text. We view these findings as establishing counterfactual importance weighting as a foundation for further research rather than a complete solution.",

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of breast cancer histopathology images is pivotal for early oncological diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.However, conventional deep learning architectures often encounter performance degradation under limited annotations and suffer from a \"blackbox\" nature, hindering their clinical integration. To mitigate these limitations, we propose GAFRNet, a robust and interpretable Graph Attention and FuzzyRule Network specifically engineered for histopathology image classification with scarce supervision. GAFRNet constructs a similarity-driven graph representation to model intersample relationships and employs a multihead graph attention mechanism to capture complex relational features across heterogeneous tissue structures.Concurrently, a differentiable fuzzy-rule module encodes intrinsic topological descriptorsincluding node degree, clustering coefficient, and label consistencyinto explicit, human-understandable diagnostic logic. This design establishes transparent \"IF-THEN\" mappings that mimic the heuristic deduction process of medical experts, providing clear reasoning behind each prediction without relying on post-hoc attribution methods. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (BreakHis, Mini-DDSM, and ICIAR2018) demonstrate that GAFR-Net consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art methods across multiple magnifications and classification tasks. These results validate the superior generalization and practical utility of GAFR-Net as a reliable decision-support tool for weakly supervised medical image analysis.",

To stabilize end-to-end training, we introduce adaptive relaxation, which designs a relaxed feasible set that snares the neural network at initialization and shrinks it into the feasible set, enabling early exploration and strict feasibility later in training. On optimization-learning and trajectory planning benchmarks, SnareNet consistently attains improved objective quality while satisfying constraints more reliably than prior work.",

However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound.",

Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation.",

Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations.

    "abstract": "Federated sequential recommendation (FedSeqRec) aims to perform next-item prediction while keeping user data decentralised, yet model quality is frequently constrained by fragmented, noisy, and homogeneous interaction logs stored on individual devices. Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \\emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \\emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \\emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \\emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven semantic generation as a new paradigm for advancing privacy-preserving federated recommendation.",

We conceptualize this period as an early-stage crystallization phase, where oversight expectations form before norms reach equilibrium.\n  Using topic modeling in a shared comparison space, a coarse-grained oversight-theme abstraction, engagement-weighted salience, and divergence tests, we show the communities are strongly separable (JSD =0.418, cosine =0.372, permutation $p=0.0005$).

The resulting distinction offers a portable lens for designing and evaluating oversight mechanisms that match agent role, rather than applying one-size-fits-all control policies.",

    "abstract": "High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and its variants have substantially improved the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks, yet the precise mechanisms by which different strategies facilitate generalization remain poorly understood. While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Our findings suggest that effective reasoning chains facilitate learning by better compressing the task using fewer parameters, offering a new quantitative metric for analyzing reasoning processes.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robots are often deployed over long durations in diverse open, dynamic scenes, including indoor setting such as warehouses and manufacturing facilities, and outdoor settings such as agricultural and roadway operations. A core challenge is to build a scalable long-horizon memory that supports an agentic workflow for planning, retrieval, and reasoning over open-ended instructions at variable granularity, while producing precise, actionable answers for navigation. We present STaR, an agentic reasoning framework that (i) constructs a task-agnostic, multimodal long-term memory that generalizes to unseen queries while preserving fine-grained environmental semantics (object attributes, spatial relations, and dynamic events), and (ii) introduces a Scalable Task Conditioned Retrieval algorithm based on the Information Bottleneck principle to extract from long-term memory a compact, non-redundant, information-rich set of candidate memories for contextual reasoning. We evaluate STaR on NaVQA (mixed indoor/outdoor campus scenes) and WH-VQA, a customized warehouse benchmark with many visually similar objects built with Isaac Sim, emphasizing contextual reasoning. Across the two datasets, STaR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher success rates and markedly lower spatial error. We further deploy STaR on a real Husky wheeled robot in both indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating robust long horizon reasoning, scalability, and practical utility.

IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements.

Recent studies have discovered an interesting phenomenon called loss of plasticity, referring to neural networks gradually losing the ability to learn new tasks.

In this paper, we propose to investigate a gradually changing environment, and we simulate this by input/output interpolation and task sampling. We perform theoretical and empirical analysis, showing that the loss of plasticity is an artifact of abrupt tasks changes in the environment and can be largely mitigated if the world changes gradually.",

While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties. MUZZLE also identifies novel attack strategies, including 2 cross-application prompt injection attacks and an agent-tailored phishing scenario.",

In this paper, we propose a lightweight multi-view approach to short-term load forecasting that leverages single-value embeddings and a scaled time-range input to capture temporally relevant features efficiently. We introduce an embedding dropout mechanism to prevent over-reliance on specific features and enhance interpretability.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enhance collaboration in Extended Reality (XR) environments by enabling flexible object and animation creation through the combination of natural language and visual inputs. However, visual data captured by XR headsets includes real-world backgrounds that may contain irrelevant or sensitive user information, such as credit cards left on the table or facial identities of other users. Uploading those frames to cloud-based MLLMs poses serious privacy risks, particularly when such data is processed without explicit user consent. Additionally, existing colocation and synchronization mechanisms in commercial XR APIs rely on time-consuming, privacy-invasive environment scanning and struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of MLLM-integrated XR environments. In this paper, we propose PRISM-XR, a novel framework that facilitates multi-user collaboration in XR by providing privacy-aware MLLM integration. PRISM-XR employs intelligent frame preprocessing on the edge server to filter sensitive data and remove irrelevant context before communicating with cloud generative AI models. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight registration process and a fully customizable content-sharing mechanism to enable efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving content synchronization among users. Our numerical evaluation results indicate that the proposed platform achieves nearly 90% accuracy in fulfilling user requests and less than 0.27 seconds registration time while maintaining spatial inconsistencies of less than 3.5 cm. Furthermore, we conducted an IRB-approved user study with 28 participants, demonstrating that our system could automatically filter highly sensitive objects in over 90% of scenarios while maintaining strong overall usability.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making problems. Recent diffusion-based policies further improve RL by modeling complex, high-dimensional action distributions. However, existing diffusion policies primarily rely on statistical associations and fail to explicitly account for causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards, limiting their ability to identify which action components truly cause high returns. In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that CausalGDP consistently achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, especially in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.",

    "abstract": "The accelerating militarization of artificial intelligence has transformed the ethics, politics, and governance of warfare. This article interrogates how AI-driven targeting systems function as epistemic infrastructures that classify, legitimize, and execute violence, using Israel's conduct in Gaza as a paradigmatic case. Through the lens of responsibility, the article examines three interrelated dimensions: (a) political responsibility, exploring how states exploit AI to accelerate warfare while evading accountability; (b) professional responsibility, addressing the complicity of technologists, engineers, and defense contractors in the weaponization of data; and (c) personal responsibility, probing the moral agency of individuals who participate in or resist algorithmic governance. This is complemented by an examination of the position and influence of those participating in public discourse, whose narratives often obscure or normalize AI-enabled violence. The Gaza case reveals AI not as a neutral instrument but as an active participant in the reproduction of colonial hierarchies and the normalization of atrocity. Ultimately, the paper calls for a reframing of technological agency and accountability in the age of automated warfare. It concludes that confronting algorithmic violence demands a democratization of AI ethics, one that resists technocratic fatalism and centers the lived realities of those most affected by high-tech militarism.",

Motivated by these insights, we study how gradient information can be leveraged to improve neural network's ability to approximate high-frequency functions, and we propose a gradient-based residual connection as a complement to the standard identity skip connection used in residual networks. We provide simple theoretical intuition for why gradient information can help distinguish inputs and improve the approximation of functions with rapidly varying behaviour. On a synthetic regression task with a high-frequency sinusoidal ground truth, we show that conventional residual connections struggle to capture high-frequency patterns. In contrast, our gradient residual substantially improves approximation quality. We then introduce a convex combination of the standard and gradient residuals, allowing the network to flexibly control how strongly it relies on gradient information. After validating the design choices of our proposed method through an ablation study, we further validate our approach's utility on the single-image super-resolution task, where the underlying function may be high-frequency. Finally, on standard tasks such as image classification and segmentation, our method achieves performance comparable to standard residual networks, suggesting its broad utility.",

Experiments on Reasoning Gym and GSM8K show that this latent integration is competitive with strong single-model RLVR baselines. Ablations further reveal a dual mechanism of expert utilization: for simpler arithmetic domains, performance gains can largely be explained by static expert preferences, whereas more challenging settings induce increasingly concentrated and structured expert attention over training, indicating emergent specialization in how the router connects to relevant experts. Overall, hidden-state collaboration provides a compact mechanism for leveraging frozen experts, while offering an observational window into expert utilization patterns and their evolution under RLVR.",

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information. We hope FlyBench will drive progress on retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, a capability with broad applications across scientific domains.",

    "abstract": "Recent multi-agent frameworks have broadened the ability to tackle oncology decision support tasks that require reasoning over dynamic, heterogeneous patient data. We propose Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents (CoMMa), a decentralized LLM-agent framework in which specialists operate on partitioned evidence and coordinate through a game-theoretic objective for robust decision-making. In contrast to most agent architectures relying on stochastic narrative-based reasoning, CoMMa utilizes deterministic embedding projections to approximate contribution-aware credit assignment. This yields explicit evidence attribution by estimating each agent's marginal utility, producing interpretable and mathematically grounded decision pathways with improved stability. Evaluated on diverse oncology benchmarks, including a real-world multidisciplinary tumor board dataset, CoMMa achieves higher accuracy and more stable performance than data-centralized and role-based multi-agents baselines.",

    "abstract": "Hallucination remains a barrier to deploying generative models in high-consequence applications. This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions). Motivated by this, we introduce a simple normalization method to mitigate the effect of domain shift on geometric statistics, leading to AUROC gains of +34 points in multi-domain settings.",

    "abstract": "The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.\n  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media.",

Current scene synthesis methods produce sparsely furnished rooms that lack the dense clutter, articulated furniture, and physical properties essential for robotic manipulation.

SceneSmith constructs scenes through successive stages$\\unicode{x2013}$from architectural layout to furniture placement to small object population$\\unicode{x2013}$each implemented as an interaction among VLM agents: designer, critic, and orchestrator. The framework tightly integrates asset generation through text-to-3D synthesis for static objects, dataset retrieval for articulated objects, and physical property estimation. SceneSmith generates 3-6x more objects than prior methods, with <2% inter-object collisions and 96% of objects remaining stable under physics simulation. In a user study with 205 participants, it achieves 92% average realism and 91% average prompt faithfulness win rates against baselines. We further demonstrate that these environments can be used in an end-to-end pipeline for automatic robot policy evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents commonly condition actions on full action-observation histories, which introduce task-irrelevant information that easily leads to redundant actions and higher inference cost. We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction. Ablation studies show that both explicit progress prediction and selective retention are necessary for robust belief learning and performance gains.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) framework designed for deployment on edge devices. To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications.",

    "abstract": "What research can be pursued with small models trained to complete true programs? Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.",

While existing surveys provide descriptive overviews of these techniques, systematic analysis of their benefits and trade offs and how such insights can inform principled methodology for designing optimal distributed systems remain limited. This paper offers a comprehensive review of collective operations and distributed parallel strategies, complemented by mathematical formulations to deepen theoretical understanding. We further examine hybrid parallelization designs, emphasizing communication computation overlap across different stages of model deployment, including both training and inference. Recent advances in automated search for optimal hybrid parallelization strategies using cost models are also discussed. Moreover, we present case studies with mainstream architecture categories to reveal empirical insights to guide researchers and practitioners in parallelism strategy selection. Finally, we highlight open challenges and limitations of current LLM training paradigms and outline promising directions for the next generation of large scale model development.",

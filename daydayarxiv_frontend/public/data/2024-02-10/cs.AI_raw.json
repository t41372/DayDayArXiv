    "abstract": "Expert demonstrations have proven an easy way to indirectly specify complex\ntasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal\nspecifications, e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations.\nUnfortunately, these techniques are generally not sample efficient. In this\nwork, we introduce $L^*LM$, an algorithm for learning DFAs from both\ndemonstrations and natural language. Due to the expressivity of natural\nlanguage, we observe a significant improvement in the data efficiency of\nlearning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, $L^*LM$ leverages large\nlanguage models to answer membership queries about the underlying task. This is\nthen combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from\ndemonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our\nexperiments, we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a\npowerful few-shot learner.",

Trust, in this setting, is the reliance\nand confidence an agent has in the information, behaviors, intentions,\ntruthfulness, and capabilities of others within the system. Our paper\nintroduces a new graphical approach that utilizes factor graphs to represent\nthe interdependent behaviors and trustworthiness among agents. This includes\nmodeling the behavior of robots as a trajectory of actions using a Gaussian\nprocess factor graph, which accounts for smoothness, obstacle avoidance, and\ntrust-related factors. Our method for evaluating trust is decentralized and\nconsiders key interdependent sub-factors such as proximity safety, consistency,\nand cooperation. The overall system comprises a network of factor graphs that\ninteract through trust-related factors and employs a Bayesian inference method\nto dynamically assess trust-based decisions with informed consent. The\neffectiveness of this method is validated via simulations and empirical tests\nwith autonomous robots navigating unsignalized intersections.",

In response, we propose REALM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR representations that address\nthese limitations. Firstly, we apply Large Language Model (LLM) to encode long\ncontext clinical notes and GRU model to encode time-series EHR data. Secondly,\nwe prompt LLM to extract task-relevant medical entities and match entities in\nprofessionally labeled external knowledge graph (PrimeKG) with corresponding\nmedical knowledge. By matching and aligning with clinical standards, our\nframework eliminates hallucinations and ensures consistency. Lastly, we propose\nan adaptive multimodal fusion network to integrate extracted knowledge with\nmultimodal EHR data. Our extensive experiments on MIMIC-III mortality and\nreadmission tasks showcase the superior performance of our REALM framework over\nbaselines, emphasizing the effectiveness of each module.

To address this problem, this paper will provide a\nnew approach by analyzing the EHG signals, which are recorded on the abdomen of\nthe mother during labor and pregnancy. The EHG signal reflects the electrical\nactivity that induces the mechanical contraction of the myometrium. Because\nEHGs are known to be non-stationary signals, and because we anticipate\nconnectivity to alter during contraction, we applied the windowing approach on\nreal signals to help us identify the best windows and the best nodes with the\nmost significant data to be used for classification. The suggested pipeline\nincludes i) divide the 16 EHG signals that are recorded from the abdomen of\npregnant women in N windows; ii) apply the connectivity matrices on each\nwindow; iii) apply the Graph theory-based measures on the connectivity matrices\non each window; iv) apply the consensus Matrix on each window in order to\nretrieve the best windows and the best nodes. Following that, several neural\nnetwork and machine learning methods are applied to the best windows and best\nnodes to categorize pregnancy and labor contractions, based on the different\ninput parameters (connectivity method alone, connectivity method plus graph\nparameters, best nodes, all nodes, best windows, all windows). Results showed\nthat the best nodes are nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; while the best windows are\n2, 4, and 5. The classification results obtained by using only these best nodes\nare better than when using the whole nodes. The results are always better when\nusing the full burst, whatever the chosen nodes. Thus, the windowing approach\nproved to be an innovative technique that can improve the differentiation\nbetween labor and pregnancy EHG signals.",

To tackle\nthis problem, we introduce an innovative Open-Set Surgical Activity Recognition\n(OSSAR) framework.

Additionally, we address the issue of over-confidence in the\nclosed set by refining model calibration, avoiding misclassification of unknown\nclasses as known ones. To support our assertions, we establish an open-set\nsurgical activity benchmark utilizing the public JIGSAWS dataset. Besides, we\nalso collect a novel dataset on endoscopic submucosal dissection for surgical\nactivity tasks. Extensive comparisons and ablation experiments on these\ndatasets demonstrate the significant outperformance of our method over existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to predict the survival time (ST) of glioblastoma (GBM)\npatients undergoing different treatments based on preoperative magnetic\nresonance (MR) scans. The personalized and precise treatment planning can be\nachieved by comparing the ST of different treatments. It is well established\nthat both the current status of the patient (as represented by the MR scans)\nand the choice of treatment are the cause of ST. While previous related\nMR-based glioblastoma ST studies have focused only on the direct mapping of MR\nscans to ST, they have not included the underlying causal relationship between\ntreatments and ST. To address this limitation, we propose a\ntreatment-conditioned regression model for glioblastoma ST that incorporates\ntreatment information in addition to MR scans. Our approach allows us to\neffectively utilize the data from all of the treatments in a unified manner,\nrather than having to train separate models for each of the treatments.\nFurthermore, treatment can be effectively injected into each convolutional\nlayer through the adaptive instance normalization we employ. We evaluate our\nframework on the BraTS20 ST prediction task. Three treatment options are\nconsidered: Gross Total Resection (GTR), Subtotal Resection (STR), and no\nresection. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of injecting\nthe treatment for estimating GBM survival.",

Yet, traditional tuning narrowly views\ndialogue generation as resembling other language generation tasks, ignoring the\nrole disparities between two speakers and the multi-round interactive process\nthat dialogues ought to be. Such a manner often leads to unsatisfactory chat\nconsistency for the built agent. In this work, we emphasize the interactive,\ncommunicative nature of dialogue and argue that it is more feasible to model\nthe speaker roles of agent and user separately, enabling the agent to adhere to\nits role consistently. With this in mind, we propose an efficient Multi-round\nInteractive Dialogue Tuning (Midi-Tuning) framework. It models the agent and\nuser individually with two adapters built upon large language models. The\nadapters make use of respective utterances round by round in alternating order\nand they are tuned via a round-level memory caching mechanism. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that, our framework performs superior to traditional\nfine-tuning and harbors the tremendous potential for improving dialogue\nconsistency.",

    "abstract": "While previous research backdoored neural networks by changing their\nparameters, recent work uncovered a more insidious threat: backdoors embedded\nwithin the definition of the network's architecture. This involves injecting\ncommon architectural components, such as activation functions and pooling\nlayers, to subtly introduce a backdoor behavior that persists even after (full\nre-)training. However, the full scope and implications of architectural\nbackdoors have remained largely unexplored. Bober-Irizar et al. [2023]\nintroduced the first architectural backdoor; they showed how to create a\nbackdoor for a checkerboard pattern, but never explained how to target an\narbitrary trigger pattern of choice. In this work we construct an arbitrary\ntrigger detector which can be used to backdoor an architecture with no human\nsupervision. This leads us to revisit the concept of architecture backdoors and\ntaxonomise them, describing 12 distinct types. To gauge the difficulty of\ndetecting such backdoors, we conducted a user study, revealing that ML\ndevelopers can only identify suspicious components in common model definitions\nas backdoors in 37% of cases, while they surprisingly preferred backdoored\nmodels in 33% of cases. To contextualize these results, we find that language\nmodels outperform humans at the detection of backdoors. Finally, we discuss\ndefenses against architectural backdoors, emphasizing the need for robust and\ncomprehensive strategies to safeguard the integrity of ML systems.",

    "abstract": "Current advancements in technology have focused the attention of the quantum\ncomputing community toward exploring the potential of near-term devices whose\ncomputing power surpasses that of classical computers in practical\napplications. An unresolved central question revolves around whether the\ninherent noise in these devices can be overcome or whether any potential\nquantum advantage would be limited. There is no doubt that crosstalk is one of\nthe main sources of noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems,\nand it poses a fundamental challenge to hardware designs. Crosstalk between\nparallel instructions can corrupt quantum states and cause incorrect program\nexecution. In this study, we present a necessary analysis of the crosstalk\nerror effect on NISQ devices. Our approach is extremely straightforward and\npractical to estimate the crosstalk error of various multi-qubit devices. In\nparticular, we combine the randomized benchmarking (RB) and simultaneous\nrandomized benchmarking (SRB) protocol to estimate the crosstalk error from the\ncorrelation controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. We demonstrate this protocol\nexperimentally on 5-, 7-, \\& 16-qubit devices. Our results demonstrate the\ncrosstalk error model of three different IBM quantum devices over the\nexperimental week and compare the error variation against the machine, number\nof qubits, quantum volume, processor, and topology. We then confirm the\nimprovement in the circuit fidelity on different benchmarks by up to 3.06x via\ninserting an instruction barrier, as compared with an IBM quantum noisy device\nwhich offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice. Finally, we discuss\nthe current system limitation, its tradeoff on fidelity and depth, noise beyond\nthe NISQ system, and mitigation opportunities to ensure that the quantum\noperation can perform its quantum magic undisturbed.",

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, the rapid development of information and internet\ntechnologies has spawned massive amounts of data and information. The\ninformation explosion drives many enterprises or individuals to seek to rent\ncloud computing infrastructure to put their applications in the cloud. However,\nthe agreements reached between cloud computing providers and clients are often\nnot efficient. Many factors affect the efficiency, such as the idleness of the\nproviders' cloud computing infrastructure, and the additional cost to the\nclients. One possible solution is to introduce a comprehensive, bargaining game\n(a type of negotiation), and schedule resources according to the negotiation\nresults. We propose an agent-based auto-negotiation system for resource\nscheduling based on fuzzy logic. The proposed method can complete a one-to-one\nauto-negotiation process and generate optimal offers for the provider and\nclient. We compare the impact of different member functions, fuzzy rule sets,\nand negotiation scenario cases on the offers to optimize the system. It can be\nconcluded that our proposed method can utilize resources more efficiently and\nis interpretable, highly flexible, and customizable. We successfully train\nmachine learning models to replace the fuzzy negotiation system to improve\nprocessing speed.

The expected surge in connected\ndevices and resource-demanding applications presents unprecedented challenges\nfor energy resources.

The objective function is to maximize the system's overall profit as a\nfunction of the number of concurrently supported requests while simultaneously\nminimizing energy consumption over an extended period of time. In addition,\nend-to-end latency requirements and resource capacity constraints are\nconsidered for computing and networking resources, where queuing theory is\nutilized to estimate the Age of Information (AoI) for requests.

We collected and preprocessed data from 40 students from different\nmultimodal sources: learning strategies from system logs, emotions from face\nrecording videos, interaction zones from eye tracking, and test performance\nfrom final knowledge evaluation. Our objective was to test whether the\nprediction could be improved by using attribute selection and classification\nensembles. We carried out three experiments by applying six classification\nalgorithms to numerical and discretized preprocessed multimodal data. The\nresults show that the best predictions were produced using ensembles and\nselecting the best attributes approach with numerical data.",

    "abstract": "Although deep reinforcement learning methods can learn effective policies for\nchallenging problems such as Atari games and robotics tasks, algorithms are\ncomplex, and training times are often long. This study investigates how\nEvolution Strategies perform compared to gradient-based deep reinforcement\nlearning methods. We use Evolution Strategies to optimize the weights of a\nneural network via neuroevolution, performing direct policy search. We\nbenchmark both deep policy networks and networks consisting of a single linear\nlayer from observations to actions for three gradient-based methods, such as\nProximal Policy Optimization. These methods are evaluated against three\nclassical Evolution Strategies and Augmented Random Search, which all use\nlinear policy networks. Our results reveal that Evolution Strategies can find\neffective linear policies for many reinforcement learning benchmark tasks,\nunlike deep reinforcement learning methods that can only find successful\npolicies using much larger networks, suggesting that current benchmarks are\neasier to solve than previously assumed. Interestingly, Evolution Strategies\nalso achieve results comparable to gradient-based deep reinforcement learning\nalgorithms for higher-complexity tasks. Furthermore, we find that by directly\naccessing the memory state of the game, Evolution Strategies can find\nsuccessful policies in Atari that outperform the policies found by Deep\nQ-Learning. Evolution Strategies also outperform Augmented Random Search in\nmost benchmarks, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness in\ntraining linear policy networks.",

    "abstract": "The irreducible complexity of natural phenomena has led Graph Neural Networks\nto be employed as a standard model to perform representation learning tasks on\ngraph-structured data. While their capacity to capture local and global\npatterns is remarkable, the implications associated with long-range and\nhigher-order dependencies pose considerable challenges to such models. This\nwork starts with a theoretical framework to reveal the impact of network's\nwidth, depth, and graph topology on the over-squashing phenomena in\nmessage-passing neural networks. Then, the work drifts towards, higher-order\ninteractions and multi-relational inductive biases via Topological Neural\nNetworks. Such models propagate messages through higher-dimensional structures,\nproviding shortcuts or additional routes for information flow. With this\nconstruction, the underlying computational graph is no longer coupled with the\ninput graph structure, thus mitigating the aforementioned bottlenecks while\naccounting also for higher-order interactions. Inspired by Graph Attention\nNetworks, two topological attention networks are proposed: Simplicial and Cell\nAttention Networks. The rationale behind these architecture is to leverage the\nextended notion of neighbourhoods provided by the arrangement of groups of\nnodes within a simplicial or cell complex to design anisotropic aggregations\nable to measure the importance of the information coming from different regions\nof the domain. By doing so, they capture dependencies that conventional Graph\nNeural Networks might miss. Finally, a multi-way communication scheme is\nintroduced with Enhanced Cellular Isomorphism Networks, which augment\ntopological message passing schemes to enable a direct interactions among\ngroups of nodes arranged in ring-like structures.",

Finally, we evaluate the\nperformance of our metric with detailed analysis. Our empirical results\ndemonstrate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity within verified\nfactors, improving on conventional metrics by 12 points in the F1 score.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have stepped forward the\ndevelopment of multilingual speech and machine translation by its reduced\nrepresentation errors and incorporated external knowledge. However, both\ntranslation tasks typically utilize beam search decoding and top-1 hypothesis\nselection for inference. These techniques struggle to fully exploit the rich\ninformation in the diverse N-best hypotheses, making them less optimal for\ntranslation tasks that require a single, high-quality output sequence. In this\npaper, we propose a new generative paradigm for translation tasks, namely\n\"GenTranslate\", which builds upon LLMs to generate better results from the\ndiverse translation versions in N-best list. Leveraging the rich linguistic\nknowledge and strong reasoning abilities of LLMs, our new paradigm can\nintegrate the rich information in N-best candidates to generate a\nhigher-quality translation result. Furthermore, to support LLM finetuning, we\nbuild and release a HypoTranslate dataset that contains over 592K\nhypotheses-translation pairs in 11 languages. Experiments on various speech and\nmachine translation benchmarks (e.g., FLEURS, CoVoST-2, WMT) demonstrate that\nour GenTranslate significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary recommendation systems are designed to meet users' needs by\ndelivering tailored lists of items that align with their specific demands or\ninterests. In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial\nrole by modeling the intra-list correlations among items. The key challenge of\nreranking lies in the exploration of optimal sequences within the combinatorial\nspace of permutations. Recent research proposes a generator-evaluator learning\nparadigm, where the generator generates multiple feasible sequences and the\nevaluator picks out the best sequence based on the estimated listwise score.\nThe generator is of vital importance, and generative models are well-suited for\nthe generator function. Current generative models employ an autoregressive\nstrategy for sequence generation. However, deploying autoregressive models in\nreal-time industrial systems is challenging. To address these issues, we\npropose a Non-AutoRegressive generative model for reranking Recommendation\n(NAR4Rec) designed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To tackle\nchallenges such as sparse training samples and dynamic candidates, we introduce\na matching model. Considering the diverse nature of user feedback, we employ a\nsequence-level unlikelihood training objective to differentiate feasible\nsequences from unfeasible ones. Additionally, to overcome the lack of\ndependency modeling in non-autoregressive models regarding target items, we\nintroduce contrastive decoding to capture correlations among these items.\nExtensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of NAR4Rec over\nstate-of-the-art reranking methods. Online A/B tests reveal that NAR4Rec\nsignificantly enhances the user experience. Furthermore, NAR4Rec has been fully\ndeployed in a popular video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily active\nusers.",

    "abstract": "Urban knowledge graph has recently worked as an emerging building block to\ndistill critical knowledge from multi-sourced urban data for diverse urban\napplication scenarios. Despite its promising benefits, urban knowledge graph\nconstruction (UrbanKGC) still heavily relies on manual effort, hindering its\npotential advancement. This paper presents UrbanKGent, a unified large language\nmodel agent framework, for urban knowledge graph construction. Specifically, we\nfirst construct the knowledgeable instruction set for UrbanKGC tasks (such as\nrelational triplet extraction and knowledge graph completion) via\nheterogeneity-aware and geospatial-infused instruction generation. Moreover, we\npropose a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement module to enhance and\nrefine the trajectories distilled from GPT-4. Through hybrid instruction\nfine-tuning with augmented trajectories on Llama 2 and Llama 3 family, we\nobtain UrbanKGC agent family, consisting of UrbanKGent-7/8/13B version. We\nperform a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets using both human\nand GPT-4 self-evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that UrbanKGent\nfamily can not only significantly outperform 31 baselines in UrbanKGC tasks,\nbut also surpass the state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, by more than 10% with\napproximately 20 times lower cost.

Secondly,\nthere is an absence of objective and fair benchmark that encompass most\nchemistry tasks.

Notably, ChemLLM achieves results comparable to GPT-4 on the core\nchemical tasks and demonstrates competitive performance with LLMs of similar\nsize in general scenarios. ChemLLM paves a new path for exploration in chemical\nstudies, and our method of incorporating structured chemical knowledge into\ndialogue systems sets a new standard for developing LLMs in various scientific\nfields.

The\nstandard treatment is to supplement carbohydrate intake with an artificial\npancreas, i.e. a continuous insulin pump (basal shots), as well as occasional\ninsulin injections (bolus shots). The goal of the treatment is to keep blood\nglucose at the center of an acceptable range, as measured through a continuous\nglucose meter. A secondary goal is to minimize injections, which are unpleasant\nand difficult for some patients to implement. In this study, neuroevolution was\nused to discover an optimal strategy for the treatment. Based on a dataset of\n30 days of treatment and measurements of a single patient, a random forest was\nfirst trained to predict future glucose levels. A neural network was then\nevolved to prescribe carbohydrates, basal pumping levels, and bolus injections.\nEvolution discovered a Pareto front that reduced deviation from the target and\nnumber of injections compared to the original data, thus improving patients'\nquality of life. To make the system easier to adopt, a language interface was\ndeveloped with a large language model.

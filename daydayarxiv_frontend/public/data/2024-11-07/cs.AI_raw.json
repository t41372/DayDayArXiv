    "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become the de\nfacto standards for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human\npreferences or specific goals. However, DPO requires high-quality preference\ndata and suffers from unstable preference optimization. In this work, we aim to\nimprove the preference optimization pipeline by taking a closer look at\npreference data generation and training regularization techniques. For\npreference data generation, we demonstrate that existing scoring-based reward\nmodels produce unsatisfactory preference data and perform poorly on\nout-of-distribution tasks. This significantly impacts the LLM alignment\nperformance when using these data for preference tuning. To ensure high-quality\npreference data generation, we propose an iterative pairwise ranking mechanism\nthat derives preference ranking of completions using pairwise comparison\nsignals. For training regularization, we observe that preference optimization\ntends to achieve better convergence when the LLM predicted likelihood of\npreferred samples gets slightly reduced. However, the widely used supervised\nnext-word prediction regularization strictly prevents any likelihood reduction\nof preferred samples. This observation motivates our design of a\nbudget-controlled regularization formulation. Empirically we show that\ncombining the two designs leads to aligned models that surpass existing SOTA\nacross two popular benchmarks.",

Recently, there has been a growing\ninterest in applying similar principles of proportional representation to\nenhance interpretability in machine learning, specifically in Explainable AI\n(XAI). This study investigates the integration of D'Hondt-based voting\nprinciples in the DhondtXAI method, which leverages resource allocation\nconcepts to interpret feature importance within AI models. Through a comparison\nof SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and DhondtXAI, we evaluate their\neffectiveness in feature attribution within CatBoost and XGBoost models for\nbreast cancer and diabetes prediction, respectively.

However, current LLM\nlanguage generation focuses on responding accurately to questions and requests\nwith a single effective response. In reality, many real dialogues are\ninteractive, meaning an agent's utterances will influence their conversational\npartner, elicit information, or change their opinion. Accounting for how an\nagent can effectively steer a conversation is a crucial ability in many\ndialogue tasks, from healthcare to preference elicitation. Existing methods for\nfine-tuning dialogue agents to accomplish such tasks would rely on curating\nsome amount of expert data. However, doing so often requires understanding the\nunderlying cognitive processes of the conversational partner, which is a skill\nneither humans nor LLMs trained on human data can reliably do. Our key insight\nis that while LLMs may not be adept at identifying effective strategies for\nsteering conversations a priori, or in the middle of an ongoing conversation,\nthey can do so post-hoc, or in hindsight, after seeing how their conversational\npartner responds. We use this fact to rewrite and augment existing suboptimal\ndata, and train via offline reinforcement learning (RL) an agent that\noutperforms both prompting and learning from unaltered human demonstrations. We\napply our approach to two domains that require understanding human mental\nstate, intelligent interaction, and persuasion: mental health support, and\nsoliciting charitable donations.

However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to\ntrain large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering),\nvalue-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have\nproven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language\nmodels. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to\nlarge architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large\ndatasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL\nmethods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses\nthese drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nproblem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In\nthis way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the\nlikelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function\nduring finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying\nperformance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in\npractice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this,\nour approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models,\nwithout the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without\nthe need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages.\nEmpirically, we evaluate our method on both pretrained LLMs and VLMs, on a\nvariety of tasks including both natural language dialogue and robotic\nmanipulation and navigation from images.",

We imagine a\ngenerative process for story writing where a source-selection schema is first\nselected by a journalist, and then sources are chosen based on categories in\nthat schema. Learning the article's plan means predicting the schema initially\nchosen by the journalist. Working with professional journalists, we adapt five\nexisting schemata and introduce three new ones to describe journalistic plans\nfor the inclusion of sources in documents. Then, inspired by Bayesian\nlatent-variable modeling, we develop metrics to select the most likely plan, or\nschema, underlying a story, which we use to compare schemata. We find that two\nschemata: stance and social affiliation best explain source plans in most\ndocuments. However, other schemata like textual entailment explain source plans\nin factually rich topics like \"Science\". Finally, we find we can predict the\nmost suitable schema given just the article's headline with reasonable\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Recently, breakthroughs in video modeling have allowed for controllable\ncamera trajectories in generated videos. However, these methods cannot be\ndirectly applied to user-provided videos that are not generated by a video\nmodel. In this paper, we present ReCapture, a method for generating new videos\nwith novel camera trajectories from a single user-provided video. Our method\nallows us to re-generate the reference video, with all its existing scene\nmotion, from vastly different angles and with cinematic camera motion. Notably,\nusing our method we can also plausibly hallucinate parts of the scene that were\nnot observable in the reference video. Our method works by (1) generating a\nnoisy anchor video with a new camera trajectory using multiview diffusion\nmodels or depth-based point cloud rendering and then (2) regenerating the\nanchor video into a clean and temporally consistent reangled video using our\nproposed masked video fine-tuning technique.",

    "abstract": "With the introduction of transformer-based models for vision and language\ntasks, such as LLaVA and Chameleon, there has been renewed interest in the\ndiscrete tokenized representation of images. These models often treat image\npatches as discrete tokens, analogous to words in natural language, learning\njoint alignments between visual and human languages. However, little is known\nabout the statistical behavior of these visual languages - whether they follow\nsimilar frequency distributions, grammatical structures, or topologies as\nnatural languages. In this paper, we take a natural-language-centric approach\nto analyzing discrete visual languages and uncover striking similarities and\nfundamental differences. We demonstrate that, although visual languages adhere\nto Zipfian distributions, higher token innovation drives greater entropy and\nlower compression, with tokens predominantly representing object parts,\nindicating intermediate granularity. We also show that visual languages lack\ncohesive grammatical structures, leading to higher perplexity and weaker\nhierarchical organization compared to natural languages. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that, while vision models align more closely with natural languages\nthan other models, this alignment remains significantly weaker than the\ncohesion found within natural languages. Through these experiments, we\ndemonstrate how understanding the statistical properties of discrete visual\nlanguages can inform the design of more effective computer vision models.",

However, it remains unclear\nwhy this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game\nmatching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward\nvalues and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited\nnumber of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this\npaper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling,\nand establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural\nnetworks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use.\nDespite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary\nchoice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a\nreward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a\nmonotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept\nof order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model\npossesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward\nupper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an\nalternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical\ninsights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward\nmodeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base\nLLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity,\nquality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.",

The limited access to source code in vital\nsystems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical\nInfrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary\nlevel. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after\ncompilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor.\nThis gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being\nsaid, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the\nsignificance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source\ncode. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial\nsemantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing\nvulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant\ndatasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary\ncode vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and\nmulti-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and\nassociation with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872\nsamples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of\n(i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv)\nrecovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently,\nwe fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance\nincrease of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and\nCodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally,\nusing DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability\nclassification task.

Our approach enables flexible\ntree-structured speculation without the overhead of maintaining and\norchestrating additional models. SuffixDecoding builds and dynamically updates\nsuffix trees to capture patterns in the generated text, using them to construct\nspeculation trees through a principled scoring mechanism based on empirical\ntoken frequencies. SuffixDecoding requires only CPU memory which is plentiful\nand underutilized on typical LLM serving nodes. We demonstrate that\nSuffixDecoding achieves competitive speedups compared to model-based approaches\nacross diverse workloads including open-domain chat, code generation, and\ntext-to-SQL tasks. For open-ended chat and code generation tasks,\nSuffixDecoding achieves up to $1.4\\times$ higher output throughput than\nSpecInfer and up to $1.1\\times$ lower time-per-token (TPOT) latency. For a\nproprietary multi-LLM text-to-SQL application, SuffixDecoding achieves up to\n$2.9\\times$ higher output throughput and $3\\times$ lower latency than\nspeculative decoding.

    "abstract": "Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and\nindustrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local\nminima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence\nto reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper\npresents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that\ninnovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with\nperiodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these\nimpediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is\ndistinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the\none exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution.\nIt enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a\nstrategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of\nescaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization\nlandscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency\nof gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic\nperturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima\nacross diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving\nthe 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results\nshow a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on\nresponse surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex\ncontinuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D\nbenchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its\nability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize\nSPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.",

In this study, we introduce FineTuneBench, an evaluation framework and\ndataset for understanding how well commercial fine-tuning APIs can successfully\nlearn new and updated knowledge. We analyze five frontier LLMs with\ncommercially available fine-tuning APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro,\non their effectiveness in two settings: (1) ingesting novel information, such\nas recent news events and new people profiles, and (2) updating existing\nknowledge, such as updated medical guidelines and code frameworks. Our results\nreveal substantial shortcomings in all the models' abilities to effectively\nlearn new information through fine-tuning, with an average generalization\naccuracy of 37% across all models. When updating existing knowledge, such as\nincorporating medical guideline updates, commercial fine-tuning APIs show even\nmore limited capability (average generalization accuracy of 19%). Overall,\nfine-tuning GPT-4o mini is the most effective for infusing new knowledge and\nupdating knowledge, followed by GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o. The fine-tuning APIs\nfor Gemini 1.5 Flesh and Gemini 1.5 Pro are unable to learn new knowledge or\nupdate existing knowledge.

Our approach begins with the insight that both the spatial structure\nof a 3D scene and the temporal evolution of a 4D scene can be effectively\nrepresented through sequences of video frames. While recent video diffusion\nmodels have shown remarkable success in producing vivid visuals, they face\nlimitations in directly recovering 3D/4D scenes due to limited spatial and\ntemporal controllability during generation. To overcome this, we propose\nST-Director, which decouples spatial and temporal factors in video diffusion by\nlearning dimension-aware LoRAs from dimension-variant data. This controllable\nvideo diffusion approach enables precise manipulation of spatial structure and\ntemporal dynamics, allowing us to reconstruct both 3D and 4D representations\nfrom sequential frames with the combination of spatial and temporal dimensions.\nAdditionally, to bridge the gap between generated videos and real-world scenes,\nwe introduce a trajectory-aware mechanism for 3D generation and an\nidentity-preserving denoising strategy for 4D generation. Extensive experiments\non various real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DimensionX\nachieves superior results in controllable video generation, as well as in 3D\nand 4D scene generation, compared with previous methods.",

While existing approaches like Mora and AesopAgent integrate multiple\nagents for Story-to-Video (S2V) generation, they fall short in preserving\nprotagonist consistency and supporting Customized Storytelling Video Generation\n(CSVG). To address these limitations, we propose StoryAgent, a multi-agent\nframework designed for CSVG.

Specifically, we\nintroduce a customized Image-to-Video (I2V) method, LoRA-BE, to enhance\nintra-shot temporal consistency, while a novel storyboard generation pipeline\nis proposed to maintain subject consistency across shots.

This\nability to understand and work with complex information has made MLLMs useful\nin areas such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and digital content.

    "abstract": "Akin to neuroplasticity in human brains, the plasticity of deep neural\nnetworks enables their quick adaption to new data. This makes plasticity\nparticularly crucial for deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents: Once\nplasticity is lost, an agent's performance will inevitably plateau because it\ncannot improve its policy to account for changes in the data distribution,\nwhich are a necessary consequence of its learning process. Thus, developing\nwell-performing and sample-efficient agents hinges on their ability to remain\nplastic during training. Furthermore, the loss of plasticity can be connected\nto many other issues plaguing deep RL, such as training instabilities, scaling\nfailures, overestimation bias, and insufficient exploration. With this survey,\nwe aim to provide an overview of the emerging research on plasticity loss for\nacademics and practitioners of deep reinforcement learning. First, we propose a\nunified definition of plasticity loss based on recent works, relate it to\ndefinitions from the literature, and discuss metrics for measuring plasticity\nloss. Then, we categorize and discuss numerous possible causes of plasticity\nloss before reviewing currently employed mitigation strategies. Our taxonomy is\nthe first systematic overview of the current state of the field. Lastly, we\ndiscuss prevalent issues within the literature, such as a necessity for broader\nevaluation, and provide recommendations for future research, like gaining a\nbetter understanding of an agent's neural activity and behavior.",

Recently,\nself-supervised depth estimation methods have demonstrated great potential as\nthey can efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabelled real-world data.\nHowever, most existing methods are designed under the assumption of static\nscenes, which hinders their adaptability in dynamic environments. To address\nthis issue, we present D$^3$epth, a novel method for self-supervised depth\nestimation in dynamic scenes. It tackles the challenge of dynamic objects from\ntwo key perspectives. First, within the self-supervised framework, we design a\nreprojection constraint to identify regions likely to contain dynamic objects,\nallowing the construction of a dynamic mask that mitigates their impact at the\nloss level. Second, for multi-frame depth estimation, we introduce a cost\nvolume auto-masking strategy that leverages adjacent frames to identify regions\nassociated with dynamic objects and generate corresponding masks. This provides\nguidance for subsequent processes. Furthermore, we propose a spectral entropy\nuncertainty module that incorporates spectral entropy to guide uncertainty\nestimation during depth fusion, effectively addressing issues arising from cost\nvolume computation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on KITTI and\nCityscapes datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently\noutperforms existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation baselines.

    "abstract": "Deep regression models are used in a wide variety of safety-critical\napplications, but are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Although many defenses\nhave been proposed for classification models, they are ineffective as they do\nnot consider the uniqueness of regression models. First, the outputs of\nregression models are continuous values instead of discretized labels. Thus,\nthe potential infected target of a backdoored regression model has infinite\npossibilities, which makes it impossible to be determined by existing defenses.\nSecond, the backdoor behavior of backdoored deep regression models is triggered\nby the activation values of all the neurons in the feature space, which makes\nit difficult to be detected and mitigated using existing defenses. To resolve\nthese problems, we propose DRMGuard, the first defense to identify if a deep\nregression model in the image domain is backdoored or not. DRMGuard formulates\nthe optimization problem for reverse engineering based on the unique\noutput-space and feature-space characteristics of backdoored deep regression\nmodels. We conduct extensive evaluations on two regression tasks and four\ndatasets. The results show that DRMGuard can consistently defend against\nvarious backdoor attacks. We also generalize four state-of-the-art defenses\ndesigned for classifiers to regression models, and compare DRMGuard with them.\nThe results show that DRMGuard significantly outperforms all those defenses.",

Recent deep-learned VO methods\nshow robust performance but suffer from sample inefficiency during training;\nhence, they require huge datasets and compute resources. So, we propose a\nrobust and sample-efficient VO pipeline based on motion priors available while\nan agent is navigating an environment. It consists of a training-free\naction-prior based geometric VO module that estimates a coarse relative pose\nwhich is further consumed as a motion prior by a deep-learned VO model, which\nfinally produces a fine relative pose to be used by the navigation policy. This\nstrategy helps our pipeline achieve up to 2x sample efficiency during training\nand demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness in point-goal navigation\ntasks compared to state-of-the-art VO method(s). Realistic indoor environments\nof the Gibson dataset is used in the AI-Habitat simulator to evaluate the\nproposed approach using navigation metrics (like success/SPL) and pose metrics\n(like RPE/ATE).

I compared\nthe proposed geometric deep learning framework to current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods, and the proposed model architecture achieved greater\nperformance on all 12 benchmark tasks performed on the DrugComb dataset.\nSpecifically, the proposed framework outperformed other SOTA methods by an\naccuracy difference greater than 28%. Based on these results, I believe that\nthe equivariant graph attention network's capability of learning geometric data\naccounts for the large performance improvements. The model's ability to\ngeneralize to foreign drugs is thought to be due to the structural motifs\nproviding a better representation of the molecule. Overall, I believe that the\nproposed equivariant geometric deep learning framework serves as an effective\ntool for virtually screening anticancer drug combinations for further\nvalidation in a wet lab environment.

    "abstract": "Learning correlations from data forms the foundation of today's machine\nlearning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. While such an approach\nenables the automatic discovery of patterned relationships within big data\ncorpora, it is susceptible to failure modes when unintended correlations are\ncaptured. This vulnerability has expanded interest in interrogating\nspuriousness, often critiqued as an impediment to model performance, fairness,\nand robustness. In this article, we trace deviations from the conventional\ndefinition of statistical spuriousness-which denotes a non-causal observation\narising from either coincidence or confounding variables-to articulate how ML\nresearchers make sense of spuriousness in practice. Drawing on a broad survey\nof ML literature, we conceptualize the \"multiple dimensions of spuriousness,\"\nencompassing: relevance (\"Models should only use correlations that are relevant\nto the task.\"), generalizability (\"Models should only use correlations that\ngeneralize to unseen data\"), human-likeness (\"Models should only use\ncorrelations that a human would use to perform the same task\"), and harmfulness\n(\"Models should only use correlations that are not harmful\"). These dimensions\ndemonstrate that ML spuriousness goes beyond the causal/non-causal dichotomy\nand that the disparate interpretative paths researchers choose could\nmeaningfully influence the trajectory of ML development. By underscoring how a\nfundamental problem in ML is contingently negotiated in research contexts, we\ncontribute to ongoing debates about responsible practices in AI development.",

    "abstract": "The limitations of existing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target\nRecognition (ATR) methods lie in their confinement by the closed-environment\nassumption, hindering their effective and robust handling of unknown target\ncategories in open environments. Open Set Recognition (OSR), a pivotal facet\nfor algorithmic practicality, intends to categorize known classes while\ndenoting unknown ones as \"unknown.\" The chief challenge in OSR involves\nconcurrently mitigating risks associated with generalizing features from a\nrestricted set of known classes to numerous unknown samples and the open space\nexposure to potential unknown data. To enhance open-set SAR classification, a\nmethod called scattering kernel with reciprocal learning network is proposed.\nInitially, a feature learning framework is constructed based on reciprocal\npoint learning (RPL), establishing a bounded space for potential unknown\nclasses. This approach indirectly introduces unknown information into a learner\nconfined to known classes, thereby acquiring more concise and discriminative\nrepresentations. Subsequently, considering the variability in the imaging of\ntargets at different angles and the discreteness of components in SAR images, a\nproposal is made to design convolutional kernels based on large-sized attribute\nscattering center models. This enhances the ability to extract intrinsic\nnon-linear features and specific scattering characteristics in SAR images,\nthereby improving the discriminative features of the model and mitigating the\nimpact of imaging variations on classification performance. Experiments on the\nMSTAR datasets substantiate the superior performance of the proposed approach\ncalled ASC-RPL over mainstream methods.",

Previous methods often execute actions extemporaneously and incoherently,\nwithout long-term strategic and cooperative planning, leading to redundant\nsteps, failures, and even serious repercussions in complex tasks like\nsearch-and-rescue missions where discussion and cooperative plan are crucial.\nTo solve this issue, we propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to enhance\nthe cooperation efficiency of LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human\ncooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1)\nmeta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the\nfirst phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a\nmeta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring\na long-term strategic and coherent plan for efficient coordination. In the\nsecond phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically\nadjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object)\nthrough multi-turn discussions. This progress-based adaptation eliminates\nredundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents.\nExperimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Transport and Communicative\nWatch-And-Help tasks demonstrate that CaPo achieves much higher task completion\nrate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.The code is released at\nhttps://github.com/jliu4ai/CaPo.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in computer graphics, machine learning, and sensor\ntechnologies enable numerous opportunities for extended reality (XR) setups for\neveryday life, from skills training to entertainment. With large corporations\noffering affordable consumer-grade head-mounted displays (HMDs), XR will likely\nbecome pervasive, and HMDs will develop as personal devices like smartphones\nand tablets. However, having intelligent spaces and naturalistic interactions\nin XR is as important as technological advances so that users grow their\nengagement in virtual and augmented spaces. To this end, large language model\n(LLM)--powered non-player characters (NPCs) with speech-to-text (STT) and\ntext-to-speech (TTS) models bring significant advantages over conventional or\npre-scripted NPCs for facilitating more natural conversational user interfaces\n(CUIs) in XR. This paper provides the community with an open-source,\ncustomizable, extendable, and privacy-aware Unity package, CUIfy, that\nfacilitates speech-based NPC-user interaction with widely used LLMs, STT, and\nTTS models. Our package also supports multiple LLM-powered NPCs per environment\nand minimizes latency between different computational models through streaming\nto achieve usable interactions between users and NPCs.

Current deep learning methods often fail to\nadequately capture long-range dependencies and complex inter-variable\nrelationships, especially under real-time processing constraints. These\nlimitations arise as many models are optimized for either short-term\nforecasting with limited receptive fields or long-term accuracy at the cost of\nefficiency. Additionally, dynamic and intricate interactions between variables\nin real-world data further complicate modeling efforts. To address these\nlimitations, we propose EffiCANet, an Efficient Convolutional Attention Network\ndesigned to enhance forecasting accuracy while maintaining computational\nefficiency. EffiCANet integrates three key components: (1) a Temporal\nLarge-kernel Decomposed Convolution (TLDC) module that captures long-term\ntemporal dependencies while reducing computational overhead; (2) an\nInter-Variable Group Convolution (IVGC) module that captures complex and\nevolving relationships among variables; and (3) a Global Temporal-Variable\nAttention (GTVA) mechanism that prioritizes critical temporal and\ninter-variable features. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets\nshow that EffiCANet achieves the maximum reduction of 10.02% in MAE over\nstate-of-the-art models, while cutting computational costs by 26.2% relative to\nconventional large-kernel convolution methods, thanks to its efficient\ndecomposition strategy.",

Initially, we conduct\nmodel-agnostic pretraining of the OCR module on unlabeled documents, followed\nby its integration into any VL architecture through brief fine-tuning.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements when\napplying TAP-VL to top-performing VL models, across scene-text and\ndocument-based VL benchmarks.",

In this approach we aim to build ASR\nmodel for languages with limited digital resources by sequentially adapting the\nmodel across linguistically similar languages. We experimented this on the\nMalasar language, a Dravidian language spoken by approximately ten thousand\npeople in the Western Ghats of South India. Malasar language faces critical\nchallenges for technological intervention due to its lack of a native script\nand absence of digital or spoken data resources. Working in collaboration with\nWycliffe India and Malasar community members, we created a spoken Malasar\ncorpus paired with transcription in Tamil script, a closely related major\nlanguage. In our approach to build ASR model for Malasar, we first build an\nintermediate Tamil ASR, leveraging higher data availability for Tamil annotated\nspeech. This intermediate model is subsequently fine-tuned on Malasar data,\nallowing for more effective ASR adaptation despite limited resources. The\nmultistage fine-tuning strategy demonstrated significant improvements over\ndirect fine-tuning on Malasar data alone, achieving a word error rate (WER) of\n51.9%, which is 4.5% absolute reduction when compared to the direct fine-tuning\nmethod. Further a WER reduction to 47.3% was achieved through punctuation\nremoval in post-processing, which addresses formatting inconsistencies that\nimpact evaluation. Our results underscore the effectiveness of sequential\nmultistage fine-tuning combined with targeted post-processing as a scalable\nstrategy for ASR system development in low-resource languages, especially where\nlinguistic similarities can be leveraged to bridge gaps in training data.",

    "abstract": "Consider an undirected graph G, representing a social network, where each\nnode is blue or red, corresponding to positive or negative opinion on a topic.\nIn the voter model, in discrete time rounds, each node picks a neighbour\nuniformly at random and adopts its colour. Despite its significant popularity,\nthis model does not capture some fundamental real-world characteristics such as\nthe difference in the strengths of individuals connections, individuals with\nneutral opinion on a topic, and individuals who are reluctant to update their\nopinion. To address these issues, we introduce and study a generalisation of\nthe voter model. Motivating by campaigning strategies, we study the problem of\nselecting a set of seeds blue nodes to maximise the expected number of blue\nnodes after some rounds. We prove that the problem is NP- hard and provide a\npolynomial time approximation algorithm with the best possible approximation\nguarantee. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic graph data demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms. We also investigate\nthe convergence properties of the model. We prove that the process could take\nan exponential number of rounds to converge. However, if we limit ourselves to\nstrongly connected graphs, the convergence time is polynomial and the period\n(the number of states in convergence) divides the length of all cycles in the\ngraph.",

    "abstract": "In offline reinforcement learning, a policy is learned using a static dataset\nin the absence of costly feedback from the environment. In contrast to the\nonline setting, only using static datasets poses additional challenges, such as\npolicies generating out-of-distribution samples. Model-based offline\nreinforcement learning methods try to overcome these by learning a model of the\nunderlying dynamics of the environment and using it to guide policy search. It\nis beneficial but, with limited datasets, errors in the model and the issue of\nvalue overestimation among out-of-distribution states can worsen performance.\nCurrent model-based methods apply some notion of conservatism to the Bellman\nupdate, often implemented using uncertainty estimation derived from model\nensembles. In this paper, we propose Constrained Latent Action Policies (C-LAP)\nwhich learns a generative model of the joint distribution of observations and\nactions. We cast policy learning as a constrained objective to always stay\nwithin the support of the latent action distribution, and use the generative\ncapabilities of the model to impose an implicit constraint on the generated\nactions. Thereby eliminating the need to use additional uncertainty penalties\non the Bellman update and significantly decreasing the number of gradient steps\nrequired to learn a policy. We empirically evaluate C-LAP on the D4RL and\nV-D4RL benchmark, and show that C-LAP is competitive to state-of-the-art\nmethods, especially outperforming on datasets with visual observations.",

However, learning such\nprogress estimator, or temporal value function, across different tasks and\ndomains requires both a large amount of diverse data and methods which can\nscale and generalize. To address these challenges, we present Generative Value\nLearning (\\GVL), a universal value function estimator that leverages the world\nknowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress.\nNaively asking a VLM to predict values for a video sequence performs poorly due\nto the strong temporal correlation between successive frames. Instead, GVL\nposes value estimation as a temporal ordering problem over shuffled video\nframes; this seemingly more challenging task encourages VLMs to more fully\nexploit their underlying semantic and temporal grounding capabilities to\ndifferentiate frames based on their perceived task progress, consequently\nproducing significantly better value predictions. Without any robot or task\nspecific training, GVL can in-context zero-shot and few-shot predict effective\nvalues for more than 300 distinct real-world tasks across diverse robot\nplatforms, including challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that GVL permits flexible multi-modal in-context learning via\nexamples from heterogeneous tasks and embodiments, such as human videos. The\ngenerality of GVL enables various downstream applications pertinent to\nvisuomotor policy learning, including dataset filtering, success detection, and\nadvantage-weighted regression -- all without any model training or finetuning.",

Recent\nresearch indicates that not all objectives are equally important to the\ndecision-maker (DM). In the context of interactive EMOAs, preference\ninformation elicited from the DM during the optimization process can be\nleveraged to identify and discard irrelevant objectives, a crucial step when\nobjective evaluations are computationally expensive. However, much of the\nexisting literature fails to account for the dynamic nature of DM preferences,\nwhich can evolve throughout the decision-making process and affect the\nrelevance of objectives. This study addresses this limitation by simulating\ndynamic shifts in DM preferences within a ranking-based interactive algorithm.\nAdditionally, we propose methods to discard outdated or conflicting preferences\nwhen such shifts occur. Building on prior research, we also introduce a\nmechanism to safeguard relevant objectives that may become trapped in local or\nglobal optima due to the diminished correlation with the DM-provided rankings.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively\nmanage evolving preferences and significantly enhance the quality and\ndesirability of the solutions produced by the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Modern AI agents, driven by advances in large foundation models, promise to\nenhance our productivity and transform our lives by augmenting our knowledge\nand capabilities. To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan,\nperform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and\nrecover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range\nof scenarios. In this work, we introduce Magentic-One, a high-performing\nopen-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a\nmulti-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks\nprogress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the\nOrchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such\nas operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing\nPython code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive\nperformance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic\nbenchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these\nresults without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they\ncollaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems.\nMoreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed\nfrom the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development\nand making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source\nimplementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool\nfor agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition\nand isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner --\nwhich is important when agents' actions have side-effects. Magentic-One,\nAutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One,\nincluding ablations and error analysis are available at\nhttps://aka.ms/magentic-one",

    "abstract": "The wider application of end-to-end learning methods to embodied\ndecision-making domains remains bottlenecked by their reliance on a\nsuperabundance of training data representative of the target domain.\nMeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) approaches abandon the aim of zero-shot\ngeneralization--the goal of standard reinforcement learning (RL)--in favor of\nfew-shot adaptation, and thus hold promise for bridging larger generalization\ngaps. While learning this meta-level adaptive behavior still requires\nsubstantial data, efficient environment simulators approaching real-world\ncomplexity are growing in prevalence. Even so, hand-designing sufficiently\ndiverse and numerous simulated training tasks for these complex domains is\nprohibitively labor-intensive. Domain randomization (DR) and procedural\ngeneration (PG), offered as solutions to this problem, require simulators to\npossess carefully-defined parameters which directly translate to meaningful\ntask diversity--a similarly prohibitive assumption. In this work, we present\nDIVA, an evolutionary approach for generating diverse training tasks in such\ncomplex, open-ended simulators. Like unsupervised environment design (UED)\nmethods, DIVA can be applied to arbitrary parameterizations, but can\nadditionally incorporate realistically-available domain knowledge--thus\ninheriting the flexibility and generality of UED, and the supervised structure\nembedded in well-designed simulators exploited by DR and PG. Our empirical\nresults showcase DIVA's unique ability to overcome complex parameterizations\nand successfully train adaptive agent behavior, far outperforming competitive\nbaselines from prior literature. These findings highlight the potential of such\nsemi-supervised environment design (SSED) approaches, of which DIVA is the\nfirst humble constituent, to enable training in realistic simulated domains,\nand produce more robust and capable adaptive agents.",

Most go-to-market (GTM) platforms utilize advanced\nsearch, an interface that enables users to filter queries by various fields\nusing categories or keywords, which, historically, however, has proven to be\nexceedingly cumbersome, as users are faced with seemingly hundreds of options,\nfields, and buttons. Consequently, querying with natural language has long been\nideal, a notion further empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs).\n  In this paper, we implement and evaluate a solution for the Zoominfo product\nfor sellers, which prompts the LLM with natural language, producing search\nfields through entity extraction that are then converted into a search query.\nThe intermediary search fields offer numerous advantages for each query,\nincluding the elimination of syntax errors, simpler ground truths, and an\nintuitive format for the LLM to interpret.\n  We paired this pipeline with many advanced prompt engineering strategies,\nfeaturing an intricate system message, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning, and execution refinement. Furthermore, we manually created the\nground truth for 500+ natural language queries, enabling the supervised\nfine-tuning of Llama-3-8B-Instruct and the introduction of sophisticated\nnumerical metrics.\n  Comprehensive experiments with closed, open source, and fine-tuned LLM models\nwere conducted through exact, Jaccard, cosine, and semantic similarity on\nindividual search entities to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.\nOverall, the most accurate closed model had an average accuracy of 97% per\nquery, with only one field performing under 90%, with comparable results\nobserved from the fine-tuned models.",

    "abstract": "Learned sparse retrieval, which can efficiently perform retrieval through\nmature inverted-index engines, has garnered growing attention in recent years.\nParticularly, the inference-free sparse retrievers are attractive as they\neliminate online model inference in the retrieval phase thereby avoids huge\ncomputational cost, offering reasonable throughput and latency. However, even\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference-free sparse models lag far behind in\nterms of search relevance when compared to both sparse and dense siamese\nmodels. Towards competitive search relevance for inference-free sparse\nretrievers, we argue that they deserve dedicated training methods other than\nusing same ones with siamese encoders. In this paper, we propose two different\napproaches for performance improvement. First, we introduce the IDF-aware FLOPS\nloss, which introduces Inverted Document Frequency (IDF) to the sparsification\nof representations. We find that it mitigates the negative impact of the FLOPS\nregularization on search relevance, allowing the model to achieve a better\nbalance between accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous\nensemble knowledge distillation framework that combines siamese dense and\nsparse retrievers to generate supervisory signals during the pre-training\nphase. The ensemble framework of dense and sparse retriever capitalizes on\ntheir strengths respectively, providing a strong upper bound for knowledge\ndistillation. To concur the diverse feedback from heterogeneous supervisors, we\nnormalize and then aggregate the outputs of the teacher models to eliminate\nscore scale differences. On the BEIR benchmark, our model outperforms existing\nSOTA inference-free sparse model by \\textbf{3.3 NDCG@10 score}. It exhibits\nsearch relevance comparable to siamese sparse retrievers and client-side\nlatency only \\textbf{1.1x that of BM25}.",

Guided by this principle, we develop\nPhoneLM SLM family (currently with 0.5B and 1.5B versions), that acheive the\nstate-of-the-art capability-efficiency tradeoff among those with similar\nparameter size. We fully open-source the code, weights, and training datasets\nof PhoneLM for reproducibility and transparency, including both base and\ninstructed versions. We also release a finetuned version of PhoneLM capable of\naccurate Android Intent invocation, and an end-to-end Android demo.

Our benchmark reveals that the o1 series\nof models outperform other frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and\nGoogle in accuracy and cheating rates across both easy and hard integer\nsequences. In order to ensure models do not exploit memorized sequence values,\nwe introduce an automated cheating detection mechanism that flags the use of\nlookup tables and validated this automation against human cheating evaluations.\nThis benchmark provides a meaningful challenge for current LLMs, offering\ninsights into their mathematical reasoning and code writing capabilities, which\ncan guide future research directions and model development in mathematical\nreasoning and code synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the leading approach for addressing\ngraph analytical problems in various real-world scenarios. However, GNNs may\nproduce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node\nattributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN\nfairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness\nevaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness.\nUnderstanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature\nof the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing\nmechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN\ndebiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce\na community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing\nmethods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework\ndesigned to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a\nlearnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from\ndiverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation.\nComprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's\neffectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are prominent for their effectiveness in\nprocessing graph data for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Most works\nof GNNs assume that the observed structure accurately represents the underlying\nnode relationships. However, the graph structure is inevitably noisy or\nincomplete in reality, which can degrade the quality of graph representations.\nTherefore, it is imperative to learn a clean graph structure that balances\nperformance and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel method named\n\\textit{Global-augmented Graph Structure Learning} (GaGSL), guided by the Graph\nInformation Bottleneck (GIB) principle. The key idea behind GaGSL is to learn a\ncompact and informative graph structure for node classification tasks.\nSpecifically, to mitigate the bias caused by relying solely on the original\nstructure, we first obtain augmented features and augmented structure through\nglobal feature augmentation and global structure augmentation. We then input\nthe augmented features and augmented structure into a structure estimator with\ndifferent parameters for optimization and re-definition of the graph structure,\nrespectively. The redefined structures are combined to form the final graph\nstructure. Finally, we employ GIB based on mutual information to guide the\noptimization of the graph structure to obtain the minimum sufficient graph\nstructure. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of datasets reveal the\noutstanding performance and robustness of GaGSL compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

To this end, depending on the scenario, we use different neural\nnetworks to estimate DRC parameters. Then, a model-based inversion is completed\nto restore the original audio signal.

An extensive\nbenchmark was conducted to compare the performance of different deep learning\nmodels, including MLP, GRU, LSTM, Autoencoders, and Transformers. Both methods\nwere evaluated in a simulated urban environment in Berlin, with the neural\nnetwork model outperforming traditional methods, reducing travel times by up to\n40%, while the enhanced A* algorithm achieved a 34% improvement.

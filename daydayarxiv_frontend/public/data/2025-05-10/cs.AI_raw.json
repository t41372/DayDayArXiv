    "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted the risk of generative model collapse, where performance progressively degrades when continually trained on self-generated data. However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single, unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task. Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Two standard models for probabilistic systems are Markov chains (MCs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Classic objectives for such probabilistic models for control and planning problems are reachability and stochastic shortest path. The widely studied algorithmic approach for these problems is the Value Iteration (VI) algorithm which iteratively applies local updates called Bellman updates. There are many practical approaches for VI in the literature but they all require exponentially many Bellman updates for MCs in the worst case. A preprocessing step is an algorithm that is discrete, graph-theoretical, and requires linear space. An important open question is whether, after a polynomial-time preprocessing, VI can be achieved with sub-exponentially many Bellman updates. In this work, we present a new approach for VI based on guessing values. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, for MCs, we present an almost-linear-time preprocessing algorithm after which, along with guessing values, VI requires only subexponentially many Bellman updates. Second, we present an improved analysis of the speed of convergence of VI for MDPs. Finally, we present a practical algorithm for MDPs based on our new approach. Experimental results show that our approach provides a considerable improvement over existing VI-based approaches on several benchmark examples from the literature.",

    "abstract": "Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming, providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.",

RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.",

    "abstract": "Rational decision-making under uncertainty requires coherent degrees of belief in events. However, event probabilities generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit incoherence, violating the axioms of probability theory. This raises the question of whether coherent event probabilities can be recovered from the embeddings used by the models. If so, those derived probabilities could be used as more accurate estimates in events involving uncertainty. To explore this question, we propose enforcing axiomatic constraints, such as the additive rule of probability theory, in the latent space learned by an extended variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to LLM embeddings. This approach enables event probabilities to naturally emerge in the latent space as the VAE learns to both reconstruct the original embeddings and predict the embeddings of semantically related events. We evaluate our method on complementary events (i.e., event A and its complement, event not-A), where the true probabilities of the two events must sum to 1. Experiment results on open-weight language models demonstrate that probabilities recovered from embeddings exhibit greater coherence than those directly reported by the corresponding models and align closely with the true probabilities.",

Existing explainability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, are typically applied post hoc, adding computational overhead and sometimes producing inconsistent or ambiguous results. In this paper, we present the Deeply Explainable Artificial Neural Network (DxANN), a novel deep learning architecture that embeds explainability ante hoc, directly into the training process. Unlike conventional models that require external interpretation methods, DxANN is designed to produce per-sample, per-feature explanations as part of the forward pass. Built on a flow-based framework, it enables both accurate predictions and transparent decision-making, and is particularly well-suited for image-based tasks. While our focus is on medical imaging, the DxANN architecture is readily adaptable to other data modalities, including tabular and sequential data. DxANN marks a step forward toward intrinsically interpretable deep learning, offering a practical solution for applications where trust and accountability are essential.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning based systems become more integrated into daily life, they unlock new opportunities but face the challenge of adapting to dynamic data environments. Various forms of data shift-gradual, abrupt, or cyclic-threaten model accuracy, making continual adaptation essential. Continual Learning (CL) enables models to learn from evolving data streams while minimizing forgetting of prior knowledge. Among CL strategies, replay-based methods have proven effective, but their success relies on balancing memory constraints and retaining old class accuracy while learning new classes. This paper presents TaskVAE, a framework for replay-based CL in class-incremental settings. TaskVAE employs task-specific Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which are then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. In contrast to traditional methods that require prior knowledge of the total class count or rely on a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks without such constraints. We focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using IMU sensor-equipped devices. Unlike previous HAR studies that combine data across all users, our approach focuses on individual user data, better reflecting real-world scenarios where a person progressively learns new activities. Extensive experiments on 5 different HAR datasets show that TaskVAE outperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, and exhibits robust performance as dataset size increases. Additionally, memory footprint of TaskVAE is minimal, being equivalent to only 60 samples per task, while still being able to generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples. The contributions lie in balancing memory constraints, task-specific generation, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for real-world applications in domains like HAR.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from the curse of dimensionality, as the exponential growth in agent interactions significantly increases computational complexity and impedes learning efficiency. To mitigate this, existing efforts that rely on Mean Field (MF) simplify the interaction landscape by approximating neighboring agents as a single mean agent, thus reducing overall complexity to pairwise interactions. However, these MF methods inevitably fail to account for individual differences, leading to aggregation noise caused by inaccurate iterative updates during MF learning. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Mean Field (BMF) method to capture agent diversity with dynamic grouping in large-scale MARL, which can alleviate aggregation noise via bi-level interaction. Specifically, BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents, facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Furthermore, we propose a bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions for effective neighboring aggregation. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that the proposed BMF yields results superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",

However, sonar images are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to optical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To address these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach called NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy principle is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity CNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the efficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low computational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer decoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture integrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining minimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity. Furthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential entropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of the proposed framework.

From the data-centric perspective, the data quality of distributed datasets can not be guaranteed since annotations of different clients contain complicated label noise of varying degrees, which causes the performance degradation. There have been some early attempts to tackle noisy labels in FL. However, there exists a lack of benchmark studies on comprehensively evaluating their practical performance under unified settings. To this end, we propose the first benchmark study FNBench to provide an experimental investigation which considers three diverse label noise patterns covering synthetic label noise, imperfect human-annotation errors and systematic errors. Our evaluation incorporates eighteen state-of-the-art methods over five image recognition datasets and one text classification dataset. Meanwhile, we provide observations to understand why noisy labels impair FL, and additionally exploit a representation-aware regularization method to enhance the robustness of existing methods against noisy labels based on our observations.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer significant potential to enhance TMS, especially for the strict requirements of CAVs, such as CAV nodes moving at varying speeds, and opportunistic and intermittent network behavior. Those features distinguish ML-based TMS from social networks, static IoT, and Social IoT. This survey proposes a novel three-layer ML-based TMS framework for CAVs in the vehicle-road-cloud integration system, i.e., trust data layer, trust calculation layer and trust incentive layer. A six-dimensional taxonomy of objectives is proposed. Furthermore, the principles of ML methods for each module in each layer are analyzed. Then, recent studies are categorized based on traffic scenarios that are against the proposed objectives. Finally, future directions are suggested, addressing the open issues and meeting the research trend.

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a significant technology in wireless sensing and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), offering benefits such as low cost, high penetration, and enhanced privacy. Currently, it is widely utilized in various applications, including action recognition, human localization, and crowd counting. However, Wi-Fi sensing also faces challenges, such as low robustness and difficulties in data collection. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing, where other modalities can act as teachers, providing ground truth or robust features for Wi-Fi sensing models to learn from, or can be directly fused with Wi-Fi for enhanced sensing capabilities. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results and substantial value in practical applications, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys reviewing them. To address this gap, this paper reviews the multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing literature \\textbf{from the past 24 months} and highlights the current limitations, challenges and future directions in this field.",

Traditional analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments, often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic environments.

The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.",

    "abstract": "Chess teaching has evolved through different approaches, however, traditional methodologies, often based on memorization, contrast with the new possibilities offered by generative artificial intelligence, a technology still little explored in this field. This study seeks to empirically validate the effectiveness of the Odychess Approach in improving chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills in students. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a pre-test/post-test design and a control group (N=60). The experimental intervention implemented the Odychess Approach, incorporating a Llama 3.3 language model that was specifically adapted using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to act as a Socratic chess tutor. Quantitative assessment instruments were used to measure chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills before and after the intervention. The results of the quasi-experimental study showed significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control group in the three variables analyzed: chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills. The complementary qualitative analysis revealed greater analytical depth, more developed dialectical reasoning, and increased intrinsic motivation in students who participated in the Odychess method-based intervention. The Odychess Approach represents an effective pedagogical methodology for teaching chess, demonstrating the potential of the synergistic integration of constructivist and dialectical principles with generative artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are relevant for educators and institutions interested in adopting innovative pedagogical technologies and for researchers in the field of AI applied to education, highlighting the transferability of the language model adaptation methodology to other educational domains.",

In this paper, we propose a new Dynamic Differentially Private Decentralized learning approach (termed Dyn-D$^2$P) tailored for general time-varying directed networks. Leveraging the Gaussian DP (GDP) framework for privacy accounting, Dyn-D$^2$P dynamically adjusts gradient clipping bounds and noise levels based on gradient convergence. This proposed dynamic noise strategy enables us to enhance model accuracy while preserving the total privacy budget. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dyn-D$^2$P over its counterparts employing fixed-level noises, especially under strong privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we provide a provable utility bound for Dyn-D$^2$P that establishes an explicit dependency on network-related parameters, with a scaling factor of $1/\\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$ up to a bias error term induced by gradient clipping. To our knowledge, this is the first model utility analysis for differentially private decentralized non-convex optimization with dynamic gradient clipping bounds and noise levels.",

The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.",

    "abstract": "Multi-domain sentiment classification aims to mitigate poor performance models due to the scarcity of labeled data in a single domain, by utilizing data labeled from various domains. A series of models that jointly train domain classifiers and sentiment classifiers have demonstrated their advantages, because domain classification helps generate necessary information for sentiment classification. Intuitively, the importance of sentiment classification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment classification; but domain classification tasks are different because the impact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across different fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper parameters. However, as the number of domains increases, existing hyperparameter optimization algorithms may face the following challenges: (1) tremendous demand for computing resources, (2) convergence problems, and (3) high algorithm complexity. To efficiently generate the domain information required for sentiment classification in each domain, we propose a dynamic information modulation algorithm. Specifically, the model training process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a shared hyperparameter, which would control the proportion of domain classification tasks across all fields, is determined. In the second stage, we introduce a novel domain-aware modulation algorithm to adjust the domain information contained in the input text, which is then calculated based on a gradient-based and loss-based method. In summary, experimental results on a public sentiment analysis dataset containing 16 domains prove the superiority of the proposed method.",

Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation.

Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

We mathematically define a new notion called \\textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \\textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \\textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents JAEGER, a dual-level whole-body controller for humanoid robots that addresses the challenges of training a more robust and versatile policy. Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking (fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real environments.",

However, a prevalent limitation is that conventional deep learning models, which typically rely on training datasets, often exhibit suboptimal generalization to unseen real-world image pairs. This restricts their practical utility when faced with real-world scenarios not included in the training datasets. To overcome this, we introduce a two-stage random alternating framework (TRA-PAN) that performs instance-specific optimization for any given Multispectral(MS)/Panchromatic(PAN) pair, ensuring robust and high-quality fusion. TRA-PAN effectively integrates strong supervision constraints from reduced-resolution images with the physical characteristics of the full-resolution images. The first stage introduces a pre-training procedure, which includes Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM) to capture spectral degradation mappings, alongside a warm-up procedure designed to reduce training time and mitigate the adverse effects of reduced-resolution data. The second stage employs Random Alternation Optimization (RAO), randomly alternating between reduced- and full-resolution images to refine the fusion model progressively. This adaptive, per-instance optimization strategy, operating in a one-shot manner for each MS/PAN pair, yields superior high-resolution multispectral images. Experimental results demonstrate that TRA-PAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality in real-world scenarios, underscoring its enhanced practical applicability and robustness.",

The learning process was initiated with the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard.

    "abstract": "Causal discovery is central to inferring causal relationships from observational data. In the presence of latent confounding, algorithms such as Fast Causal Inference (FCI) learn a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) representing the true model's Markov Equivalence Class. However, their correctness critically depends on empirical faithfulness, the assumption that observed (in)dependencies perfectly reflect those of the underlying causal model, which often fails in practice due to limited sample sizes. To address this, we introduce the first nonparametric score to assess a PAG's compatibility with observed data, even with mixed variable types. This score is both necessary and sufficient to characterize structural uncertainty and distinguish between distinct PAGs. We then propose data-compatible FCI (dcFCI), the first hybrid causal discovery algorithm to jointly address latent confounding, empirical unfaithfulness, and mixed data types. dcFCI integrates our score into an (Anytime)FCI-guided search that systematically explores, ranks, and validates candidate PAGs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that dcFCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often recovering the true PAG even in small and heterogeneous datasets. Examining top-ranked PAGs further provides valuable insights into structural uncertainty, supporting more robust and informed causal reasoning and decision-making.",

Despite significant progress, existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.",

    "abstract": "The fusion technique is the key to the multimodal emotion recognition task. Recently, cross-modal attention-based fusion methods have demonstrated high performance and strong robustness. However, cross-modal attention suffers from redundant features and does not capture complementary features well. We find that it is not necessary to use the entire information of one modality to reinforce the other during cross-modal interaction, and the features that can reinforce a modality may contain only a part of it. To this end, we design an innovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN). Specifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform intra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the selected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another modality. To better capture the complementary information between the modalities, we obtain the fused weight vector by splicing and use the weight vector to achieve feature reinforcement of the modalities. We apply TCAFN to the RAVDESS and IEMOCAP datasets. For fair comparison, we use the same unimodal representations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method. The experimental results show that TACFN brings a significant performance improvement compared to other methods and reaches the state-of-the-art.

In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black--box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging, species discovery, and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.",

    "abstract": "Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing, aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures, varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations, this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical image registration technology.

A typical application scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted \"patch\" on the original neural network to achieve targeted \"forgetting\" of the requested data to delete. Specifically, inspired by the research line of neural network repair, we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum \"patch\" for unlearning a given data point with certifiable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn, which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness, achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and being competitive in efficiency and memory consumption compared to various baseline methods.",

We address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed.

    "abstract": "Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental to modern engineering and manufacturing, but creating CAD models still requires expert knowledge and specialized software. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle. These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent improvements. Our best model achieves a top-1 exact match of 69.3%, up from 58.8%, and reduces Chamfer Distance by 48.6%. Project page: https://github.com/Text-to-CadQuery/Text-to-CadQuery.",

    "abstract": "Traditional logic-based belief revision research focuses on designing rules to constrain the behavior of revision operators. Frameworks have been proposed to characterize iterated revision rules, but they are often too loose, leading to multiple revision operators that all satisfy the rules under the same belief condition. In many practical applications, such as safety critical ones, it is important to specify a definite revision operator to enable agents to iteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for iterated belief revision by characterizing belief information through preference relations. Semantically, both beliefs and new evidence are represented as belief algebras, which provide a rich and expressive foundation for belief revision. Building on traditional revision rules, we introduce additional postulates for revision with belief algebra, including an upper-bound constraint on the outcomes of revision. We prove that the revision result is uniquely determined given the current belief state and new evidence. Furthermore, to make the framework more useful in practice, we develop a particular algorithm for performing the proposed revision process. We argue that this approach may offer a more predictable and principled method for belief revision, making it suitable for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms are widely used in artificial intelligence to enhance performance and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate their utility in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function: high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine learning for dynamical environments.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how novices acquire and hone visual search skills is crucial for developing and optimizing training methods across domains. Network analysis methods can be used to analyze graph representations of visual expertise. This study investigates the relationship between eye-gaze movements and learning outcomes among undergraduate dentistry students who were diagnosing dental radiographs over multiple semesters. We use network analysis techniques to model eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network metrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify distinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association with students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network metric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores, while the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively correlated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual students over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to expert-level processing. These insights contribute to understanding expertise acquisition in visual tasks and can inform the design of AI-assisted learning interventions.",

    "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of Industry 4.0, achieving efficiency, precision, and adaptability is essential to optimize manufacturing operations. Industries suffer due to supply chain disruptions caused by anomalies, which are being detected by current AI models but leaving domain experts uncertain without deeper insights into these anomalies. Additionally, operational inefficiencies persist due to inaccurate production forecasts and the limited effectiveness of traditional AI models for processing complex sensor data. Despite these advancements, existing systems lack the seamless integration of these capabilities needed to create a truly unified solution for enhancing production and decision-making. We propose SmartPilot, a neurosymbolic, multiagent CoPilot designed for advanced reasoning and contextual decision-making to address these challenges. SmartPilot processes multimodal sensor data and is compact to deploy on edge devices. It focuses on three key tasks: anomaly prediction, production forecasting, and domain-specific question answering. By bridging the gap between AI capabilities and real-world industrial needs, SmartPilot empowers industries with intelligent decision-making and drives transformative innovation in manufacturing.

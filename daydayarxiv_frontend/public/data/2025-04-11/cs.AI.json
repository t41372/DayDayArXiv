      "abstract": "Modern cutting-edge AI applications are being developed over fast-evolving,\nheterogeneous, nascent hardware devices. This requires frequent reworking of\nthe AI software stack to adopt bottom-up changes from new hardware, which takes\ntime for general-purpose software libraries. Consequently, real applications\noften develop custom software stacks optimized for their specific workloads and\nhardware. Custom stacks help in quick development and optimization, but incur a\nlot of redundant efforts across applications in writing non-portable code. This\npaper discusses an alternative communication library interface for AI\napplications that offers both portability and performance by reducing redundant\nefforts while maintaining flexibility for customization. We present MSCCL++, a\nnovel abstraction of GPU communication based on separation of concerns: (1) a\nprimitive interface provides a minimal hardware abstraction as a common ground\nfor software and hardware developers to write custom communication, and (2)\nhigher-level portable interfaces and specialized implementations enable\noptimization for different workloads and hardware environments. This approach\nmakes the primitive interface reusable across applications while enabling\nhighly flexible optimization. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines (NCCL,\nRCCL, and MSCCL), MSCCL++ achieves speedups of up to 5.4$\\times$ for collective\ncommunication and up to 15% for real-world AI inference workloads. MSCCL++ is\nin production of multiple AI services provided by Microsoft Azure, and is also\nadopted by RCCL, the GPU collective communication library maintained by AMD.\nMSCCL++ is open-source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/mscclpp.",

However,\ncurrent MCP implementations face critical limitations: they typically require\nlocal process execution through STDIO transports, making them impractical for\nresource-constrained environments like mobile devices, web browsers, and edge\ncomputing. We present MCP Bridge, a lightweight RESTful proxy that connects to\nmultiple MCP servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified API.\nUnlike existing solutions, MCP Bridge is fully LLM-agnostic, supporting any\nbackend regardless of vendor. The system implements a risk-based execution\nmodel with three security levels standard execution, confirmation workflow, and\nDocker isolation while maintaining backward compatibility with standard MCP\nclients. Complementing this server-side infrastructure is a Python based MCP\nGemini Agent that facilitates natural language interaction with MCP tools.

      "abstract": "Computer-aided design (CAD) is a promising application area for emerging\nartificial intelligence methods. Traditional workflows for cyberphysical\nsystems create detailed digital models which can be evaluated by physics\nsimulators in order to narrow the search space before creating physical\nprototypes. A major bottleneck of this approach is that the simulators are\noften computationally expensive and slow. Recent advancements in AI methods\noffer the possibility to accelerate these pipelines. We use the recently\nreleased AircraftVerse dataset, which is especially suited for developing and\nevaluating large language models for designs. AircraftVerse contains a diverse\nset of UAV designs represented via textual design trees together with detailed\nphysics simulation results. Following the recent success of large language\nmodels (LLMs), we propose AGENT (Aircraft GENeraTor). AGENT is a comprehensive\ndesign tool built on the CodeT5+ LLM which learns powerful representations of\naircraft textual designs directly from JSON files. We develop a curriculum of\ntraining tasks which imbues a single model with a suite of useful features.\nAGENT is able to generate designs conditioned on properties of flight dynamics\n(hover time, maximum speed, etc.). Additionally, AGENT can issue evaluations of\ndesigns allowing it to act as a surrogate model of the physics simulation that\nunderlies the AircraftVerse dataset. We present a series of experiments which\ndemonstrate our system's abilities. We are able to achieve strong performance\nusing the smallest member of the CodeT5+ family (220M parameters).

In this paper, we examine how VLMs reason by analyzing their biases\nwhen confronted with scenarios that present conflicting image and text cues, a\ncommon occurrence in real-world applications. To uncover the extent and nature\nof these biases, we build upon existing benchmarks to create five datasets\ncontaining mismatched image-text pairs, covering topics in mathematics,\nscience, and visual descriptions. Our analysis shows that VLMs favor text in\nsimpler queries but shift toward images as query complexity increases. This\nbias correlates with model scale, with the difference between the percentage of\nimage- and text-preferred responses ranging from +56.8% (image favored) to\n-74.4% (text favored), depending on the task and model. In addition, we explore\nthree mitigation strategies: simple prompt modifications, modifications that\nexplicitly instruct models on how to handle conflicting information (akin to\nchain-of-thought prompting), and a task decomposition strategy that analyzes\neach modality separately before combining their results. Our findings indicate\nthat the effectiveness of these strategies in identifying and mitigating bias\nvaries significantly and is closely linked to the model's overall performance\non the task and the specific modality in question.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are extensively studied for knowledge\ngraph completion, yet their evaluation remains constrained by unrealistic\nbenchmarks. Commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect\nreal-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are\nessential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance\nvariation across domains. Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world\nassumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples,\ncontradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often\ncompress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific\nstrengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol operates under the\nunrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be\npredicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property\nprediction, entity-pair ranking and triple classification address some of these\nlimitations, they remain underutilized. This paper conducts a comprehensive\nevaluation of four representative KGE models on large-scale datasets FB-CVT-REV\nand FB+CVT-REV. Our analysis reveals critical insights, including substantial\nperformance variations between small and large datasets, both in relative\nrankings and absolute metrics, systematic overestimation of model capabilities\nwhen n-ary relations are binarized, and fundamental limitations in current\nevaluation protocols and metrics.",

However, in the\nanimation domain, large datasets are not always available. Applying generative\nmasked modeling to generate diverse instances from a single MoCap reference may\nlead to overfitting, a challenge that remains unexplored. In this work, we\npresent MotionDreamer, a localized masked modeling paradigm designed to learn\ninternal motion patterns from a given motion with arbitrary topology and\nduration. By embedding the given motion into quantized tokens with a novel\ndistribution regularization method, MotionDreamer constructs a robust and\ninformative codebook for local motion patterns. Moreover, a sliding window\nlocal attention is introduced in our masked transformer, enabling the\ngeneration of natural yet diverse animations that closely resemble the\nreference motion patterns. As demonstrated through comprehensive experiments,\nMotionDreamer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that are typically GAN\nor Diffusion-based in both faithfulness and diversity. Thanks to the\nconsistency and robustness of the quantization-based approach, MotionDreamer\ncan also effectively perform downstream tasks such as temporal motion editing,\n\\textcolor{update}{crowd animation}, and beat-aligned dance generation, all\nusing a single reference motion.

However,\nthese problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission\nthrough test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process.\nLarge language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting\nthe overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this\nend, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns\n(i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that\nboth the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these\nplans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by\nconventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller,\ncost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with\nstate-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications\nfor smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be\nincorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide\nfeedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is\nsyntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback\nfor problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level\nsolution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics\nproblems.",

Initial\nexperiments applying DRL to an implementation of the A Link to the Past example\ndo not produce the treacherous turn effect naturally, despite various\nmodifications to the environment intended to produce it. However, in this work,\nwe find the treacherous behavior to be reproducible in a DRL agent when using\nother trojan injection strategies. This approach deviates from the prototypical\ntreacherous turn behavior since the behavior is explicitly trained into the\nagent, rather than occurring as an emergent consequence of environmental\ncomplexity or poor objective specification. Nonetheless, these experiments\nprovide new insights into the challenges of producing agents capable of true\ntreacherous turn behavior.",

Fine-tuning VFMs can further unlock their\npotential for downstream tasks or scenarios. However, VFMs often contain\nsignificant feature redundancy, which may limit their adaptability to new\ntasks. In this paper, we investigate the redundancies in the segment anything\nmodel (SAM) and then propose a parameter-free fine-tuning method to address\nthis issue. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that adjust parameters, our\nmethod emphasizes selecting, reusing, and enhancing pre-trained features,\noffering a new perspective on model fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a\nchannel selection algorithm based on the model's output difference to identify\nredundant and effective channels. By selectively replacing the redundant\nchannels with more effective ones, we filter out less useful features and reuse\nthe more relevant features to downstream tasks, thereby enhancing the\ntask-specific feature representation. Experiments on both out-of-domain and\nin-domain datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.\nNotably, our approach can seamlessly integrate with existing fine-tuning\nstrategies (e.g., LoRA, Adapter), further boosting the performance of already\nfine-tuned models. Moreover, since our channel selection involves only model\ninference, our method significantly reduces computational and GPU memory\noverhead.",

Existing attacks often overlook\nthe role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been\ninsufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and\naccuracy.

Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method\noutperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and\nSAM 2.

However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice\ncomes with fundamental limitations. At a large scale, real-world data often\nexhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships,\nhierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains,\nsuch as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to\neffectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean\nspaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not\nmerely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for\nthe next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries,\nfoundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned\nstructures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to\nmatch the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency\nand expressivity.

During experiments and ablation\nstudies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is\nable to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g.,\n\"addition of outdoor dining,\", \"overpass was painted blue,\" etc.).

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps\nmay fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning\noffers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to\nlearned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based\nexplanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model\nfor interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a\nstructured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation\nworkflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm\nclassification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based\nreasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each\nbranch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning,\ncombining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that\nencourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while\nallowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate\nProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating\ncompetitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while\nproviding structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we\nconduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected\nprototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear.\nProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex,\nmulti-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward\ntransparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been gradually employed to solve\ncomplex tasks. To face the challenge, task decomposition has become an\neffective way, which proposes to divide a complex task into multiple simpler\nsubtasks and then solve them separately so that the difficulty of the original\ntask can be reduced. However, the performance of existing task decomposition\nmethods can be suboptimal when the task contains overly complex logic and\nconstraints. In this situation, the solution generated by LLMs may deviate from\nthe original purpose of the task, or contain redundant or even erroneous\ncontent. Therefore, inspired by the fact that humans possess two thinking\nsystems including fast thinking and slow thinking, this paper introduces a new\ntask decomposition method termed ``Fast-Slow-Thinking'' (FST), which stimulates\nLLMs to solve tasks through the cooperation of Fast Thinking (FT) and Slow\nThinking (ST) steps. Here FT focuses more on the general and concise aspect of\nthe task, and ST focuses more on the details of the task. In FT, LLMs are\nprompted to remove the constraints of the original task, therefore simplifying\nit to a general and concise one. In ST, we recall the constraints removed in\nFT, so that LLMs can improve the answer generated in FT to meet the\nrequirements of the original task. Therefore, our FST method enables LLMs to\nconsider a complex problem via a human-like cognition process from coarse to\nfine, the effectiveness of which has been well demonstrated by the experiments\non three types of tasks.",

      "abstract": "Writing well requires not only expressing ideas but also refining them\nthrough revision, a process facilitated by reflection. Prior research suggests\nthat feedback delivered through dialogues, such as those in writing center\ntutoring sessions, can help writers reflect more thoughtfully on their work\ncompared to static feedback. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language\nmodels (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and\nexpressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that\nLLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters,\nallowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up\nquestions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that\nvoice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange,\nencouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating\niterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared\nto text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a\nformative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers'\nreflection and subsequent revisions. Findings from this study will inform the\ndesign of intelligent and interactive writing tools, offering insights into how\nvoice-based interactions with LLM-powered conversational agents can support\nreflection and revision.",

This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant\nsetting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens --\nto a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures\nthat something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses\nStrategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage\npermissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal\ninterference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically\ncontrol interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance\nformal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to\ntrigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized\npolicy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to\nchanging specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for\ncyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to\ndemonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally\nupdated) $\\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic\npolicies.",

      "abstract": "Advancing LLM reasoning skills has captivated wide interest. However, current\npost-training techniques rely heavily on supervisory signals, such as outcome\nsupervision or auxiliary reward models, which face the problem of scalability\nand high annotation costs. This motivates us to enhance LLM reasoning without\nthe need for external supervision. We introduce a generalizable and purely\nunsupervised self-training framework, named Genius. Without external auxiliary,\nGenius requires to seek the optimal response sequence in a stepwise manner and\noptimize the LLM. To explore the potential steps and exploit the optimal ones,\nGenius introduces a stepwise foresight re-sampling strategy to sample and\nestimate the step value by simulating future outcomes. Further, we recognize\nthat the unsupervised setting inevitably induces the intrinsic noise and\nuncertainty. To provide a robust optimization, we propose an\nadvantage-calibrated optimization (ACO) loss function to mitigate estimation\ninconsistencies. Combining these techniques together, Genius provides an\nadvanced initial step towards self-improve LLM reasoning with general queries\nand without supervision, revolutionizing reasoning scaling laws given the vast\navailability of general queries.

      "abstract": "To build AI interfaces that children can intuitively understand and use,\ndesigners need a design grammar that truly serves children's developmental\nneeds. This paper bridges Artificial Intelligence design for children -- an\nemerging field still defining its best practices -- and children's animation, a\nwell-established field with decades of experience in engaging young viewers\nthrough emotionally resonant, cognitively accessible storytelling. Pairing\nPiagetian developmental theory with design pattern extraction from 52 works of\nDisney animation, the paper presents six design insights transferable to\nchild-centred AI interface design: (1) emotional expressiveness and visual\nclarity, (2) musical and auditory scaffolding, (3) audiovisual synchrony for\nemotional comfort, (4) sidekick-style personas, (5) support for symbolic play\nand imaginative exploration, and (6) predictable and scaffolded interaction\nstructures. These strategies -- long refined in Disney animation -- function as\nmultimodal scaffolds for attention, understanding, and emotional attunement,\nthereby forming a structured design grammar familiar to children and\ntransferable to AI interface design. By reframing cinematic storytelling as\ndesign logic for AI, the paper offers heuristics for crafting intuitive AI\ninterfaces that align with children's cognitive stages and emotional needs. The\nwork contributes to design theory by showing how sensory, affective and\nnarrative techniques can inform developmentally attuned AI design for children.\nFuture directions include empirical testing, cultural adaptation, and\nparticipatory co-design.",

However, information extraction (IE)\nfrom building drawings is often time-consuming and costly, especially when\ndealing with historical buildings. Drawing search can be simplified by\nleveraging the information stored in the title block portion of the drawing,\nwhich can be seen as drawing metadata. However, title block IE can be complex\nespecially when dealing with historical drawings which do not follow existing\nstandards for uniformity. This work performs a comparison of existing methods\nfor this kind of IE task, and then proposes a novel title block detection and\nIE pipeline which outperforms existing methods, in particular when dealing with\ncomplex, noisy historical drawings. The pipeline is obtained by combining a\nlightweight Convolutional Neural Network and GPT-4o, the proposed inference\npipeline detects building engineering title blocks with high accuracy, and then\nextract structured drawing metadata from the title blocks, which can be used\nfor drawing search, filtering and grouping. The work demonstrates high accuracy\nand efficiency in IE for both vector (CAD) and hand-drawn (historical)\ndrawings. A user interface (UI) that leverages the extracted metadata for\ndrawing search is established and deployed on real projects, which demonstrates\nsignificant time savings.

However,\neven recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions\naccurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial\nlayouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance\nfor T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the\nattention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory\nrequirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To\naddress this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V\ngeneration based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization.\nVideo-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG\ncreates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video,\nspecifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of\ndraft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V\ndiffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising.\nNotably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with\nadditional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V\nmodels. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment\nwith multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V\ngeneration benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench).

By embedding Large Language Model (LLM) agents within an evolutionary\ngame-theoretic framework, this paper investigates the complex interplay between\nAI developers, regulators and users, modelling their strategic choices under\ndifferent regulatory scenarios. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is used to\nquantitatively model the dilemmas faced by each actor, and LLMs provide\nadditional degrees of complexity and nuances and enable repeated games and\nincorporation of personality traits.

We observe\nthat, in case of full trust by users, incentives are effective to promote\neffective regulation; however, conditional trust may deteriorate the \"social\npact\". Establishing a virtuous feedback between users' trust and regulators'\nreputation thus appears to be key to nudge developers towards creating safe AI.\nHowever, the level at which this trust emerges may depend on the specific LLM\nused for testing. Our results thus provide guidance for AI regulation systems,\nand help predict the outcome of strategic LLM agents, should they be used to\naid regulation itself.",

      "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and\nnavigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the\nsim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands\nexpert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge\nsimulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the\nreconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception\nuncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity\nCalibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based\ndiffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual\nfidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual\nfidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world\ndynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us\nto sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy\nfine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a)\nwe fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build\nsequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the\ndiffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may\ndegrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable\nhallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator\ncalibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse\nrobots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical\ncontribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and\nreal-world experiments. Notably, our approach demonstrates robust robot\nnavigation under challenging real-world conditions, such as a broken wheel axle\non snowy surfaces.",

In this paper we\npresent FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that\nincorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks\nto the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between\npure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of\nunderstanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any\nexternal source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment\nas a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate\nmap representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM\nsystem corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation\nbetween submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from\nefficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into\nobject-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary\nqueries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The\nopen-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art\nsemantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level\nof scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects\nor areas of interest selected via natural language queries.

Post-hoc approaches\ntherein use a set of examples to specify a concept, and determine its\nembeddings in DNN latent space using data driven techniques. This proved useful\nto uncover biases between different target (foreground or concept) classes.\nHowever, given that the background is mostly uncontrolled during training, an\nimportant question has been left unattended so far: Are/to what extent are\nstate-of-the-art, data-driven post-hoc C-XAI approaches themselves prone to\nbiases with respect to their backgrounds? E.g., wild animals mostly occur\nagainst vegetation backgrounds, and they seldom appear on roads. Even simple\nand robust C-XAI methods might abuse this shortcut for enhanced performance. A\ndangerous performance degradation of the concept-corner cases of animals on the\nroad could thus remain undiscovered. This work validates and thoroughly\nconfirms that established Net2Vec-based concept segmentation techniques\nfrequently capture background biases, including alarming ones, such as\nunderperformance on road scenes. For the analysis, we compare 3 established\ntechniques from the domain of background randomization on >50 concepts from 2\ndatasets, and 7 diverse DNN architectures.

Unlike previous work, it considers UAVs with heterogeneous,\nunknown energy storage capacities and assumes no knowledge of the energy\nconsumption models. We propose a decentralised deployment strategy that\ncombines auction-based task allocation with online learning. Each UAV\nindependently decides whether to bid for orders based on its energy storage\ncharge level, the parcel mass, and delivery distance. Over time, it refines its\npolicy to bid only for orders within its capability. Simulations using\nrealistic UAV energy models reveal that, counter-intuitively, assigning orders\nto the least confident bidders reduces delivery times and increases the number\nof successfully fulfilled orders. This strategy is shown to outperform\nthreshold-based methods which require UAVs to exceed specific charge levels at\ndeployment. We propose a variant of the strategy which uses learned policies\nfor forecasting. This enables UAVs with insufficient charge levels to commit to\nfulfilling orders at specific future times, helping to prioritise early orders.\nOur work provides new insights into long-term deployment of UAV swarms,\nhighlighting the advantages of decentralised energy-aware decision-making\ncoupled with online learning in real-world dynamic environments.",

Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found\nthat FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but\ndegraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases\n(P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly\nenhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets\n(P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the\npotential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image\nrepresentations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and\nhighlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric\nhealthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for\nmulti-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a\nstructured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt\nconcatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance,\nfrequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we\npropose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory\nmodule that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT).\nEach node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input,\noutput, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis\nmethod that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path,\nsignificantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through\ncase studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we\ndemonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more\ninterpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference\nimplementation of the core TME components is available at\nhttps://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and\nstructured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a\ntree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable\nsubsteps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the\ngroundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.",

While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level\nNLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI\n(CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel\nparadigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to\nmulti-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a\nhigh-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26\nlanguages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we\nfurther propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion\nwith interpretability-aware prediction.

      "abstract": "Accommodating edge networks between IoT devices and the cloud server in\nHierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) enhances communication efficiency without\ncompromising data privacy. However, devices connected to the same edge often\nshare geographic or contextual similarities, leading to varying edge-level data\nheterogeneity with different subsets of labels per edge, on top of device-level\nheterogeneity. This hierarchical non-Independent and Identically Distributed\n(non-IID) nature, which implies that each edge has its own optimization goal,\nhas been overlooked in HFL research. Therefore, existing edge-accommodated HFL\ndemonstrates inconsistent performance across edges in various hierarchical\nnon-IID scenarios. To ensure robust performance with diverse edge-level non-IID\ndata, we propose a Personalized Hierarchical Edge-enabled Federated Learning\n(PHE-FL), which personalizes each edge model to perform well on the unique\nclass distributions specific to each edge. We evaluated PHE-FL across 4\nscenarios with varying levels of edge-level non-IIDness, with extreme IoT\ndevice level non-IIDness. To accurately assess the effectiveness of our\npersonalization approach, we deployed test sets on each edge server instead of\nthe cloud server, and used both balanced and imbalanced test sets. Extensive\nexperiments show that PHE-FL achieves up to 83 percent higher accuracy compared\nto existing federated learning approaches that incorporate edge networks, given\nthe same number of training rounds. Moreover, PHE-FL exhibits improved\nstability, as evidenced by reduced accuracy fluctuations relative to the\nstate-of-the-art FedAvg with two-level (edge and cloud) aggregation.",

Consequently, the literature fails to articulate\nthe true potency of transferable black-box attacks. We provide an empirical\nstudy of these biases and propose a framework that aids in a prior-free\ntransparent study of this paradigm. Using our framework, we analyze the role of\nprior knowledge of the target model data and number of classes in attack\nperformance. We also provide several interesting insights based on our\nanalysis, and demonstrate that priors cause overestimation in transferability\nscores.

      "abstract": "As the popularity and reach of social networks continue to surge, a vast\nreservoir of opinions and sentiments across various subjects inundates these\nplatforms. Among these, X social network (formerly Twitter) stands as a\njuggernaut, boasting approximately 420 million active users. Extracting users'\nemotional and mental states from their expressed opinions on social media has\nbecome a common pursuit. While past methodologies predominantly focused on the\ntextual content of messages to analyze user sentiment, the interactive nature\nof these platforms suggests a deeper complexity. This study employs hybrid\nmethodologies, integrating textual analysis, profile examination, follower\nanalysis, and emotion dissemination patterns. Initially, user interactions are\nleveraged to refine emotion classification within messages, encompassing\nexchanges where users respond to each other. Introducing the concept of a\ncommunication tree, a model is extracted to map these interactions.\nSubsequently, users' bios and interests from this tree are juxtaposed with\nmessage text to enrich analysis. Finally, influential figures are identified\namong users' followers in the communication tree, categorized into different\ntopics to gauge interests. The study highlights that traditional sentiment\nanalysis methodologies, focusing solely on textual content, are inadequate in\ndiscerning sentiment towards significant events, notably the presidential\nelection. Comparative analysis with conventional methods reveals a substantial\nimprovement in accuracy with the incorporation of emotion distribution patterns\nand user profiles. The proposed approach yields a 12% increase in accuracy with\nemotion distribution patterns and a 15% increase when considering user\nprofiles, underscoring its efficacy in capturing nuanced sentiment dynamics.",

However, ``data-only\" methods tend to distort fake samples in the\nlow-level feature space rather than the high-level semantic space, leading to\nlimitations in resisting malicious manipulation. Frontier research has shown\nthat integrating knowledge in deep learning can produce reliable and\ngeneralizable solutions. Inspired by these, we propose a knowledge-guided\nadversarial defense (KGAD) to actively force malicious manipulation models to\noutput semantically confusing samples. Specifically, in the process of\ngenerating adversarial noise, we focus on constructing significant semantic\nconfusions at the domain-specific knowledge level, and exploit a metric closely\nrelated to visual perception to replace the general pixel-wise metrics. The\ngenerated adversarial noise can actively interfere with the malicious\nmanipulation model by triggering knowledge-guided and perception-related\ndisruptions in the fake samples. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, we conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on human perception\nand visual quality assessment. The results on two different tasks both show\nthat our defense provides better protection compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods and achieves great generalizability.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by\nretrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. By referencing\nthis external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually\nincorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently,\nthere has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of\nRAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded\nsignificant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable\nsocietal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact\ndoes the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To\naddress this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,\nretrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the\nscale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes\nwithin the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the\nintegration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale\nLLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness\nissues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,\nFairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the\nLLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate\nfairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism\nto filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed\napproaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in\nimproving fairness while maintaining performance.",

Instead of relying on self-assessments,\nwe employ multiple observer agents.

MineWorld is driven by a visual-action autoregressive\nTransformer, which takes paired game scenes and corresponding actions as input,\nand generates consequent new scenes following the actions.

In evaluation, we propose new metrics to assess\nnot only visual quality but also the action following capacity when generating\nnew scenes, which is crucial for a world model.

However, high-dimensional language model\nembeddings, often in the range of hundreds to thousands of dimensions, can\npresent scalability challenges in terms of storage and latency, especially when\nprocessing massive financial text corpora. This paper investigates the use of\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce embedding dimensionality, thereby\nmitigating computational bottlenecks without incurring large accuracy losses.\nWe experiment with a real-world dataset and compare different similarity and\ndistance metrics under both full-dimensional and PCA-compressed embeddings. Our\nresults show that reducing vectors from 3,072 to 110 dimensions provides a\nsizeable (up to $60\\times$) speedup in retrieval operations and a $\\sim\n28.6\\times$ reduction in index size, with only moderate declines in correlation\nmetrics relative to human-annotated similarity scores. These findings\ndemonstrate that PCA-based compression offers a viable balance between\nretrieval fidelity and resource efficiency, essential for real-time systems\nsuch as Zanista AI's \\textit{Newswitch} platform.

      "abstract": "As an essential part of modern hardware design, manually writing Register\nTransfer Level (RTL) code such as Verilog is often labor-intensive. Following\nthe tremendous success of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun\nto explore utilizing LLMs for generating RTL code. However, current studies\nprimarily focus on generating simple single modules, which can not meet the\ndemands in real world. In fact, due to challenges in managing long-context RTL\ncode and complex cross-file dependencies, existing solutions cannot handle\nlarge-scale Verilog repositories in practical hardware development. As the\nfirst endeavor to exclusively adapt LLMs for large-scale RTL development, we\npropose RTLRepoCoder, a groundbreaking solution that incorporates specific\nfine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for repository-level\nVerilog code completion. Open-source Verilog repositories from the real world,\nalong with an extended context size, are used for domain-specific fine-tuning.\nThe optimized RAG system improves the information density of the input context\nby retrieving relevant code snippets. Tailored optimizations for RAG are\ncarried out, including the embedding model, the cross-file context splitting\nstrategy, and the chunk size. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on public benchmark, significantly surpassing GPT-4 and advanced\ndomain-specific LLMs on Edit Similarity and Exact Match rate. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our approach and offer\ninsights for future work.",

      "abstract": "Advancements in emotion aware language processing increasingly shape vital\nNLP applications ranging from conversational AI and affective computing to\ncomputational psychology and creative content generation. Existing emotion\ndatasets either lack emotional granularity or fail to capture necessary\nstylistic diversity, limiting the advancement of effective emotion conditioned\ntext generation systems. Seeking to bridge this crucial gap between granularity\nand style diversity, this paper introduces a novel systematically constructed\ndataset named ELSA Emotion and Language Style Alignment Dataset leveraging fine\ngrained emotion taxonomies adapted from existing sources such as dair ai\nemotion dataset and GoEmotions taxonomy. This dataset comprises multiple\nemotionally nuanced variations of original sentences regenerated across\ndistinct contextual styles such as conversational, formal, poetic, and\nnarrative, using advanced Large Language Models LLMs. Rigorous computational\nevaluation using metrics such as perplexity, embedding variance, readability,\nlexical diversity, and semantic coherence measures validates the datasets\nemotional authenticity, linguistic fluency, and textual diversity.\nComprehensive metric analyses affirm its potential to support deeper\nexplorations into emotion conditioned style adaptive text generation. By\nenabling precision tuned emotionally nuanced language modeling, our dataset\ncreates fertile ground for research on fine grained emotional control, prompt\ndriven explanation, interpretability, and style adaptive expressive language\ngeneration with LLMs.",

      "abstract": "While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance\nsmall language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models\n(LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency,\nand potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast,\nsmaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual\ncapabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable\ndata. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose\na multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized\nroles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically\nachieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small\nLLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a\npeer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial\ndata samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the\nAdjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the\nsynthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can\nachieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data\nmatches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g.,\nQwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large\nmodels for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic\ncoordination of smaller agents.

We propose a novel framework CoProSketch, providing\nprominent controllability and details for sketch generation with diffusion\nmodels. A straightforward method is fine-tuning a pretrained image generation\ndiffusion model with binarized sketch images. However, we find that the\ndiffusion models fail to generate clear binary images, which makes the produced\nsketches chaotic. We thus propose to represent the sketches by unsigned\ndistance field (UDF), which is continuous and can be easily decoded to sketches\nthrough a lightweight network. With CoProSketch, users generate a rough sketch\nfrom a bounding box and a text prompt. The rough sketch can be manually edited\nand fed back into the model for iterative refinement and will be decoded to a\ndetailed sketch as the final result. Additionally, we curate the first\nlarge-scale text-sketch paired dataset as the training data. Experiments\ndemonstrate superior semantic consistency and controllability over baselines,\noffering a practical solution for integrating user feedback into generative\nworkflows.",

Traditionally\ndeployed in cloud datacenters, LLMs are now increasingly moving towards more\naccessible edge platforms to protect sensitive user data and ensure privacy\npreservation. The limited computational resources of individual edge devices,\nhowever, can result in excessively prolonged inference latency and overwhelmed\nmemory usage. While existing research has explored collaborative edge computing\nto break the resource wall of individual devices, these solutions yet suffer\nfrom massive communication overhead and under-utilization of edge resources.\nFurthermore, they focus exclusively on optimizing the prefill phase, neglecting\nthe crucial autoregressive decoding phase for generative LLMs. To address that,\nwe propose Jupiter, a fast, scalable, and resource-efficient collaborative edge\nAI system for generative LLM inference. Jupiter introduces a flexible pipelined\narchitecture as a principle and differentiates its system design according to\nthe differentiated characteristics of the prefill and decoding phases. For\nprefill phase, Jupiter submits a novel intra-sequence pipeline parallelism and\ndevelops a meticulous parallelism planning strategy to maximize resource\nefficiency; For decoding, Jupiter devises an effective outline-based pipeline\nparallel decoding mechanism combined with speculative decoding, which further\nmagnifies inference acceleration. Extensive evaluation based on realistic\nimplementation demonstrates that Jupiter remarkably outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches under various edge environment setups, achieving up\nto 26.1x end-to-end latency reduction while rendering on-par generation\nquality.",

However, the synergistic\neffects in multimodal data increase the sensitivity of ICL performance to the\nconfigurations of ICDs, stimulating the need for a more stable and general\nmapping function. Mathematically, in Transformer-based models, ICDs act as\n\"shift vectors\" added to the hidden states of query tokens. Inspired by this,\nwe introduce Mimic In-Context Learning (MimIC) to learn stable and\ngeneralizable shift effects from ICDs. Specifically, compared with some\nprevious shift vector-based methods, MimIC more strictly approximates the shift\neffects by integrating lightweight learnable modules into LMMs with four key\nenhancements: 1) inserting shift vectors after attention layers, 2) assigning a\nshift vector to each attention head, 3) making shift magnitude query-dependent,\nand 4) employing a layer-wise alignment loss. Extensive experiments on two LMMs\n(Idefics-9b and Idefics2-8b-base) across three multimodal tasks (VQAv2, OK-VQA,\nCaptioning) demonstrate that MimIC outperforms existing shift vector-based\nmethods.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide a structured approach to\ncapture Architecture Design Decisions (ADDs), but their adoption is limited due\nto the manual effort involved and insufficient tool support. Our previous work\nhas shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in generating ADDs.\nHowever, simply prompting the LLM does not produce quality ADDs. Moreover,\nusing third-party LLMs raises privacy concerns, while self-hosting them poses\nresource challenges.\n  To this end, we experimented with different approaches like few-shot,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning to enhance LLM's ability\nto generate ADDs. Our results show that both techniques improve effectiveness.\nBuilding on this, we propose Domain Specific Retreival Augumented Few Shot Fine\nTuninng, DRAFT, which combines the strengths of all these three approaches for\nmore effective ADD generation. DRAFT operates in two phases: an offline phase\nthat fine-tunes an LLM on generating ADDs augmented with retrieved examples and\nan online phase that generates ADDs by leveraging retrieved ADRs and the\nfine-tuned model.\n  We evaluated DRAFT against existing approaches on a dataset of 4,911 ADRs and\nvarious LLMs and analyzed them using automated metrics and human evaluations.\nResults show DRAFT outperforms all other approaches in effectiveness while\nmaintaining efficiency.

To\ndevelop metacognitive artificial intelligence (AI) models that reflect human\nreasoning, it is essential to account for the attributes that influence\nreasoning patterns and decision-maker behavior, often leading to different or\neven conflicting choices. This makes it crucial to incorporate cognitive\nattributes in designing AI models that align with human decision-making\nprocesses, especially in high-stakes domains such as finance, where decisions\nhave significant real-world consequences. However, existing AI alignment\nresearch has primarily focused on value alignment, often overlooking the role\nof individual cognitive attributes that distinguish decision-makers. To address\nthis issue, this paper (1) analyzes the literature on cognitive attributes, (2)\nestablishes five criteria for defining them, and (3) categorizes 19\ndomain-specific cognitive attributes relevant to financial decision-making.\nThese three components provide a strong basis for developing AI systems that\naccurately reflect and align with human decision-making processes in financial\ncontexts.",

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural\nEncoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel\nmulti-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral,\nwithin-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the\nInternational Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes\nrecordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In\ncomparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on\nmulti-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's\nlearned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training,\nthey are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording.

In\nparticular, selecting one arm may influence the future rewards of other arms, a\nscenario not adequately captured by existing models such as rotting bandits or\nrestless bandits. To address this limitation, we propose the influential bandit\nproblem, which models inter-arm interactions through an unknown, symmetric,\npositive semi-definite interaction matrix that governs the dynamics of arm\nlosses. We formally define this problem and establish two regret lower bounds,\nincluding a superlinear $\\Omega(T^2 / \\log^2 T)$ bound for the standard UCB\nalgorithm and an algorithm-independent $\\Omega(T)$ bound, which highlight the\ninherent difficulty of the setting. We then introduce a new algorithm based on\na lower confidence bound (LCB) estimator tailored to the structure of the loss\ndynamics. Under mild assumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \\log\nT)$, which is nearly optimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon.\nThe algorithm is simple to implement and computationally efficient.

While Sparse Autoencoders are well-suited to improve these\naspects by enabling targeted activation-based unlearning, prior approaches\nunderperform gradient-based methods. This work demonstrates that, contrary to\nthese earlier findings, SAEs can significantly improve unlearning when employed\ndynamically. We introduce $\\textbf{Dynamic DAE Guardrails}$ (DSG), a novel\nmethod for precision unlearning that leverages principled feature selection and\na dynamic classifier. Our experiments show DSG substantially outperforms\nleading unlearning methods, achieving superior forget-utility trade-offs. DSG\naddresses key drawbacks of gradient-based approaches for unlearning -- offering\nenhanced computational efficiency and stability, robust performance in\nsequential unlearning, stronger resistance to relearning attacks, better data\nefficiency including zero-shot settings, and more interpretable unlearning.",

      "abstract": "AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through\nenormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user\nneeds, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding\nuser intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to\nmake such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale,\nsignificant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost.\nThis paper presents a design of the Super Agent System. Upon receiving a user\nprompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the\nrequest to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically\ngenerates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as\nAI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language\nmodels vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high\ncomputational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid\nmode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based\non task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super\nagent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge\nhardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud\ncollaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents\nto be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.",

While recent video\ndiffusion models have made significant progress, existing approaches struggle\nwith limited motion representations and inadequate integration of camera and\nhuman motion controls.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate TokenMotion's\neffectiveness across both text-to-video and image-to-video paradigms,\nconsistently outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in human-centric\nmotion control tasks.

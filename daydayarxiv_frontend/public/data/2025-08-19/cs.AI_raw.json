    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages fine-grained cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves up to 9 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.",

    "abstract": "Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks. Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

However, many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands, and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced both quality and stability of the results.",

This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at https://github.com/anushka-kore/OccluNet.git",

However, it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve generalization by optimizing in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a new hyperparameter to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective generalization and scales to large models such as LLAMA3-8B. Furthermore, as a result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty quantification. We test ABMLL on CrossFit and Unified-QA datasets and find that it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and expected calibration error.",

Using the open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept activations for each class and language version. We average the different language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.

While models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures -- ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms, CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.",

Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect 1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age. We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based text-to-image generative models.",

    "abstract": "As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual (e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2) what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for managing risks.",

We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.\n  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like skilled human planners.\n  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for, or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence) organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.",

The quality of tongue surface segmentation significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by 96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool (available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available tongue image segmentation tool.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become increasingly deployed in critical applications.",

These methods involve computing the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax, to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

    "abstract": "Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

We investigate both supervised and self-supervised approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps.

Our results demonstrate that ResNet50 consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.",

In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly. In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem. Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement, especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.",

Since full retraining is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically, we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning quality.

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function. Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD, highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.",

To address this, we pioneer \"pointing\" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.",

Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses. Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks.

To address this gap, we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term \"social context\". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions.",

We present a framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect, they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated with other application domains.",

    "abstract": "We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0°) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180°) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90° and 270°. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90° and 270° rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180° images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.",

To address this need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students' prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and 3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1 informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess learning effectiveness and assessment design.",

    "abstract": "The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated. Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each benefits equally from the participation of the other.",

    "abstract": "The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the \"collaboration paradox\": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate, evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems for business analytics.",

    "abstract": "This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large language models (LLMs). We first assess the reproducibility of the original InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline: (1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance.

    "abstract": "A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone, limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.",

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \\textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \\textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.",

    "abstract": "Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage, reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the Fisher-metric.",

However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.",

    "abstract": "LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on 17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.",

Accurate assessment of the CoW is important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler (TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature, affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD. In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO) network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of 0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained settings.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding credible and transparent ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that augments standard driving objectives with ethics-aware cost signals. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic, risk-sensitive Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on closed-loop simulation environments derived from large-scale, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing risk to others while maintaining ego performance and comfort. This work provides a reproducible benchmark for Safe RL with explicitly ethics-aware objectives in human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments. Across two interactive benchmarks and five random seeds, our policy decreases conflict frequency by 25-45% compared to matched task successes while maintaining comfort metrics within 5%.",

To address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL), cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\\%) and Revenue (+8.33\\%).

This process is typically approached in two ways: one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions, benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios, providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy tailored to their goals and constraints.

Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically, ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet, a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST) mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer computations.",

However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels. We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on the multi-RAG system ensemble.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment. Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations, validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality, their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent. Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation methodologies.",

While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.",

This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.",

We present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters (Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model \"writes while counting.\" We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens), XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt, surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to training- or decoding-based methods.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale, heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap, outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives. Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystem.

This enables precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.",

The latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be available in screening settings.

Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism.

    "abstract": "An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (ERIS) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial generalization mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that ERIS achieves a statistically significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, consistently securing the top performance rank.",

A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72 patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation. Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required adjustments using DSC.\n  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma, 0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was 76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01) and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.\n  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver surgery.",

    "abstract": "Current code generation benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness while overlooking two critical aspects of real-world programming: algorithmic efficiency and code quality. We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality. COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions. Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.",

    "abstract": "Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC) framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage, we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage, we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.",

However, we observe that their performance degrades significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural modifications.",

Security-enhancing methods aim to improve FL robustness against malicious behaviors such as byzantine attacks, poisoning, and Sybil attacks.

    "abstract": "Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features, known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based interpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information, concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop, CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B. Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.",

Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition. We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles. Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation (mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics as universal statements.

    "abstract": "As AI systems become more capable, integrated, and widespread, understanding the associated risks becomes increasingly important. This paper maps the full spectrum of AI risks, from current harms affecting individual users to existential threats that could endanger humanity's survival. We organize these risks into three main causal categories. Misuse risks, which occur when people deliberately use AI for harmful purposes - creating bioweapons, launching cyberattacks, adversarial AI attacks or deploying lethal autonomous weapons. Misalignment risks happen when AI systems pursue outcomes that conflict with human values, irrespective of developer intentions. This includes risks arising through specification gaming (reward hacking), scheming and power-seeking tendencies in pursuit of long-term strategic goals. Systemic risks, which arise when AI integrates into complex social systems in ways that gradually undermine human agency - concentrating power, accelerating political and economic disempowerment, creating overdependence that leads to human enfeeblement, or irreversibly locking in current values curtailing future moral progress. Beyond these core categories, we identify risk amplifiers - competitive pressures, accidents, corporate indifference, and coordination failures - that make all risks more likely and severe. Throughout, we connect today's existing risks and empirically observable AI behaviors to plausible future outcomes, demonstrating how existing trends could escalate to catastrophic outcomes. Our goal is to help readers understand the complete landscape of AI risks. Good futures are possible, but they don't happen by default. Navigating these challenges will require unprecedented coordination, but an extraordinary future awaits if we do.",

DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.",

To improve the quality of third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding multi-level semantic similarities.

In the latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete, and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is essential.

Despite the presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.",

    "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for explanation purposes.",

    "abstract": "Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\\#) and ten LLMs-including both commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code, achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\\% with negligible output token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to 36.1\\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.",

In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints. We formalize the problem and introduce two efficient methods designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. These methods are lightweight, requiring tuning only two parameters or a small neural network trained to capture soft constraints while maintaining the original ranking structure. To evaluate the task, we extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance and adding very little overhead. With our work, we explore a new and flexible way to interact with graph databases that allows users to specify their preferences by providing examples interactively.",

However, with the advancements of pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques. While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies.

    "abstract": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input-Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we utilize meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also discover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query strategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better. We can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the queries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the size should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the result would be 90.0% on AIME24 and 80.0% on AIME25.

    "abstract": "Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\\% and 52.5\\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents.",

    "abstract": "Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients, and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational resources.",

In contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study, we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $β$-variation autoencoder ($p$C-$β$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the $p$C-$β$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in data-constrained experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice. Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data characteristics.\n  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package, CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods through a unified interface.",

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare, where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks, including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the highest scores, while η and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding. Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes exceed that of model choice.",

    "abstract": "Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR) reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.",

    "abstract": "License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement, crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.",

Despite advancements in the performance of recent CI systems, speech comprehension in noisy or reverberant conditions remains a challenge. Recent and ongoing developments in deep learning reveal promising opportunities for enhancing CI sound coding capabilities, not only through replicating traditional signal processing methods with neural networks, but also through integrating visual cues as auxiliary data for multimodal speech processing. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel noise-suppressing CI system, AVSE-ECS, which utilizes an audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) model as a pre-processing module for the deep-learning-based ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) sound coding strategy. Specifically, a joint training approach is applied to model AVSE-ECS, an end-to-end CI system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the previous ECS strategy in noisy conditions, with improved objective speech intelligibility scores. The methods and findings in this study demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using deep learning to integrate the AVSE module into an end-to-end CI system",

However, their design remains challenging due to complex nonlinear mechanics, multistability, and the need for precise control of deployment forces. Here, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for both forward prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami (CKO) without requiring pre-collected training data. By embedding mechanical equilibrium equations directly into the learning process, the model predicts complete energy landscapes with high accuracy while minimizing non-physical artifacts. The inverse design routine specifies both target stable-state heights and separating energy barriers, enabling freeform programming of the entire energy curve. This capability is extended to hierarchical CKO assemblies, where sequential layer-by-layer deployment is achieved through programmed barrier magnitudes. Finite element simulations and experiments on physical prototypes validate the designed deployment sequences and barrier ratios, confirming the robustness of the approach. This work establishes a versatile, data-free route for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami-inspired metamaterials, offering broad potential for deployable aerospace systems, morphing structures, and soft robotic actuators.",

    "abstract": "Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants, environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis. We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario, when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of 0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.",

To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is Band-Localized Activation (BLA), a novel activation designed for joint frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). Through structured frequency control and spatially localized responses, BLA effectively mitigates spectral bias and enhances training stability. The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network, enabling precise frequency selection and adaptive band control. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation, as well as 3D shape reconstruction and novel view synthesis.",

However, existing 3DGS-based methods still face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism, where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and shape accuracy during training.

While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore, leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects.

    "abstract": "We propose a fully spectral, neuro\\-symbolic reasoning architecture that leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components, our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals, processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over state\\-of\\-the\\-art neuro\\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for robust and interpretable reasoning systems.",

    "abstract": "Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive, dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving the way for more efficient model deployment.",

Transformer-based models show promise in improving medical image analysis, but their application to extremity fractures is limited. This study addresses this gap by applying object detection transformers to wrist and hand X-rays.\n  Methods: We fine-tuned the RT-DETR and Co-DETR models, pre-trained on COCO, using over 26,000 annotated X-rays from a proprietary clinical dataset. Each image was labeled for fracture presence with bounding boxes. A ResNet-50 classifier was trained on cropped regions to refine abnormality classification. Supervised contrastive learning was used to enhance embedding quality. Performance was evaluated using AP@50, precision, and recall metrics, with additional testing on real-world X-rays.\n  Results: RT-DETR showed moderate results (AP@50 = 0.39), while Co-DETR outperformed it with an AP@50 of 0.615 and faster convergence. The integrated pipeline achieved 83.1% accuracy, 85.1% precision, and 96.4% recall on real-world X-rays, demonstrating strong generalization across 13 fracture types. Visual inspection confirmed accurate localization.\n  Conclusion: Our Co-DETR-based pipeline demonstrated high accuracy and clinical relevance in wrist and hand fracture detection, offering reliable localization and differentiation of fracture types. It is scalable, efficient, and suitable for real-time deployment in hospital workflows, improving diagnostic speed and reliability in musculoskeletal radiology.",

This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.

To verify its practical usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However, existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value < 0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\\% and 10\\% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively.

    "abstract": "Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum, with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline <-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers. Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299 patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG. Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive, highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease progression.",

We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs' vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks. CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer LLM deployment.",

Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94% accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1 Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic readiness in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data. Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to existing mainstream approaches.",

    "abstract": "Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they often answer \"Yes\" to queries like \"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?\", they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1) their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs: while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with performance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$ pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\\%$ over vanilla-prompted agents.",

    "abstract": "Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic barriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity of consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external pressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable work schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like hidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like personalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work schedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how these factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We construct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments, algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to temporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational, utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how diminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central argument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given) requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection between our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that limitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be rigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This connection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value, by anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As solutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support value deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these measures strengthen agency.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.",

This context-free mathematical formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1) post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3) Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMVM-5F3E/",

To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\\times$ faster training efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous trading strategies have been a subject of research within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for aconsiderable period. Various AI techniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading financial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent advancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. Many developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong performance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly referred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real markets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of risk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired by a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are highly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can significantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational simulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major Brazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated superior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically significant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight emerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the development of a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework in the future",

This bias allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question (Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O) settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings, providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability.

We introduce a cost-efficient and cognitively grounded method: fine-tuning LLMs on native speakers' word-association norms, leveraging cognitive psychology findings that such associations capture cultural knowledge. Using word association datasets from native speakers in the US (English) and China (Mandarin), we train Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization. We evaluate models' cultural alignment through a two-tier evaluation framework that spans lexical associations and cultural value alignment using the World Values Survey. Results show significant improvements in lexical alignment (16-20% English, 43-165% Mandarin on Precision@5) and high-level cultural value shifts. On a subset of 50 questions where US and Chinese respondents diverge most, fine-tuned Qwen nearly doubles its response alignment with Chinese values (13 to 25). Remarkably, our trained 7-8B models match or exceed vanilla 70B baselines, demonstrating that a few million of culture-grounded associations achieve value alignment without expensive retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI models.",

However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.",

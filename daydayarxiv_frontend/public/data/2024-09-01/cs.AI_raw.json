    "abstract": "In the realm of dermatology, the complexity of diagnosing skin conditions\nmanually necessitates the expertise of dermatologists. Accurate identification\nof various skin ailments, ranging from cancer to inflammatory diseases, is\nparamount. However, existing artificial intelligence (AI) models in dermatology\nface challenges, particularly in accurately diagnosing diseases across diverse\nskin tones, with a notable performance gap in darker skin. Additionally, the\nscarcity of publicly available, unbiased datasets hampers the development of\ninclusive AI diagnostic tools. To tackle the challenges in accurately\npredicting skin conditions across diverse skin tones, we employ a\ntransfer-learning approach that capitalizes on the rich, transferable knowledge\nfrom various image domains. Our method integrates multiple pre-trained models\nfrom a wide range of sources, including general and specific medical images, to\nimprove the robustness and inclusiveness of the skin condition predictions. We\nrigorously evaluated the effectiveness of these models using the Diverse\nDermatology Images (DDI) dataset, which uniquely encompasses both\nunderrepresented and common skin tones, making it an ideal benchmark for\nassessing our approach. Among all methods, Med-ViT emerged as the top performer\ndue to its comprehensive feature representation learned from diverse image\nsources. To further enhance performance, we conducted domain adaptation using\nadditional skin image datasets such as HAM10000. This adaptation significantly\nimproved model performance across all models.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently lack domain-specific knowledge and\neven fine-tuned models tend to hallucinate. Hence, more reliable models that\ncan include external knowledge are needed. We present a pipeline, 4StepFocus,\nand specifically a preprocessing step, that can substantially improve the\nanswers of LLMs. This is achieved by providing guided access to external\nknowledge making use of the model's ability to capture relational context and\nconduct rudimentary reasoning by themselves. The method narrows down\npotentially correct answers by triplets-based searches in a semi-structured\nknowledge base in a direct, traceable fashion, before switching to latent\nrepresentations for ranking those candidates based on unstructured data. This\ndistinguishes it from related methods that are purely based on latent\nrepresentations. 4StepFocus consists of the steps: 1) Triplet generation for\nextraction of relational data by an LLM, 2) substitution of variables in those\ntriplets to narrow down answer candidates employing a knowledge graph, 3)\nsorting remaining candidates with a vector similarity search involving\nassociated non-structured data, 4) reranking the best candidates by the LLM\nwith background data provided. Experiments on a medical, a product\nrecommendation, and an academic paper search test set demonstrate that this\napproach is indeed a powerful augmentation. It not only adds relevant traceable\nbackground information from information retrieval, but also improves\nperformance considerably in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This paper\npresents a novel, largely unexplored direction and therefore provides a wide\nrange of future work opportunities.

    "abstract": "In the field of autonomous driving, developing safe and trustworthy\nautonomous driving policies remains a significant challenge. Recently,\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has attracted substantial\nattention due to its potential to enhance training safety and sampling\nefficiency. Nevertheless, existing RLHF-enabled methods often falter when faced\nwith imperfect human demonstrations, potentially leading to training\noscillations or even worse performance than rule-based approaches. Inspired by\nthe human learning process, we propose Physics-enhanced Reinforcement Learning\nwith Human Feedback (PE-RLHF). This novel framework synergistically integrates\nhuman feedback (e.g., human intervention and demonstration) and physics\nknowledge (e.g., traffic flow model) into the training loop of reinforcement\nlearning. The key advantage of PE-RLHF is its guarantee that the learned policy\nwill perform at least as well as the given physics-based policy, even when\nhuman feedback quality deteriorates, thus ensuring trustworthy safety\nimprovements. PE-RLHF introduces a Physics-enhanced Human-AI (PE-HAI)\ncollaborative paradigm for dynamic action selection between human and\nphysics-based actions, employs a reward-free approach with a proxy value\nfunction to capture human preferences, and incorporates a minimal intervention\nmechanism to reduce the cognitive load on human mentors. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse driving scenarios demonstrate that PE-RLHF significantly\noutperforms traditional methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance\nin safety, efficiency, and generalizability, even with varying quality of human\nfeedback. The philosophy behind PE-RLHF not only advances autonomous driving\ntechnology but can also offer valuable insights for other safety-critical\ndomains.

Using LLM-based code generation to further\nlower the barrier to creative output is an exciting opportunity. However, the\nbest strategy for code generation for visual node-based programming languages\nis still an open question. In particular, such languages have multiple levels\nof representation in text, each of which may be used for code generation. In\nthis work, we explore the performance of LLM code generation in audio\nprogramming tasks in visual programming languages at multiple levels of\nrepresentation. We explore code generation through metaprogramming code\nrepresentations for these languages (i.e., coding the language using a\ndifferent high-level text-based programming language), as well as through\ndirect node generation with JSON. We evaluate code generated in this way for\ntwo visual languages for audio programming on a benchmark set of coding\nproblems. We measure both correctness and complexity of the generated code. We\nfind that metaprogramming results in more semantically correct generated code,\ngiven that the code is well-formed (i.e., is syntactically correct and runs).\nWe also find that prompting for richer metaprogramming using randomness and\nloops led to more complex code.",

Traditional\nmethods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning,\nwhich suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a \"black box.\"\nThis paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed \"Entropy Loss,\"\nalong with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on\nthe functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model.\nDrawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission\nprocess in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady\nchanges in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy.\nBy modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct\na probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy\nLoss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network\nparameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that\nthe Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing\nthe same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using\nEntropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47\\% compared to models\nwithout Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy.

Our\ninnovation relies on representing agent behaviors as networks of rules (Fuzzy\nCognitive Maps) and empirically evaluating different measures of distance\nbetween these networks. Then, we form groups of think-alike agents via\ncommunity detection and simplify them to a representative agent. Case studies\nshow that our simplifications remain accuracy.",

The prediction of acid generation through AMD is\nimportant to do in overburden management and planning the post-mining land use.\nOne of the methods used to predict AMD is a lab-scale kinetic test to determine\nthe rate of acid formation over time using representative samples in the field.\nHowever, this test requires a long-time procedure and large amount of chemical\nreagents lead to inefficient cost. On the other hand, there is potential for\nmachine learning to learn the pattern behind the lab-scale kinetic test data.\nThis study describes an approach to use artificial neural network (ANN)\nmodeling to predict the result from lab-scale kinetic tests. Various ANN model\nis used based on 83 weeks experiments of lab-scale kinetic tests with 100\\%\npotential acid-forming rock. The model approaches the monitoring of pH, ORP,\nconductivity, TDS, sulfate, and heavy metals (Fe and Mn). The overall\nNash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) obtained in this study was 0.99 on training and\nvalidation data, indicating a strong correlation and accurate prediction\ncompared to the actual lab-scale kinetic tests data. This show the ANN ability\nto learn patterns, trends, and seasonality from past data for accurate\nforecasting, thereby highlighting its significant contribution to solving AMD\nproblems. This research is also expected to establish the foundation for a new\napproach to predict AMD, with time efficient, accurate, and cost-effectiveness\nin future applications.",

Non-autoregressive systems require explicit\nalignment information between text and speech during training and predict\ndurations for linguistic units (e.g. phone), which may compromise their\nnaturalness. In this paper, we introduce Masked Generative Codec Transformer\n(MaskGCT), a fully non-autoregressive TTS model that eliminates the need for\nexplicit alignment information between text and speech supervision, as well as\nphone-level duration prediction. MaskGCT is a two-stage model: in the first\nstage, the model uses text to predict semantic tokens extracted from a speech\nself-supervised learning (SSL) model, and in the second stage, the model\npredicts acoustic tokens conditioned on these semantic tokens. MaskGCT follows\nthe mask-and-predict learning paradigm. During training, MaskGCT learns to\npredict masked semantic or acoustic tokens based on given conditions and\nprompts. During inference, the model generates tokens of a specified length in\na parallel manner.

Current\nstate-of-the-art field crop management relies on coarse-scale crop management\nstrategies, where entire fields are sprayed with pest and disease-controlling\nchemicals, leading to increased cost and sub-optimal soil and crop management.\nTo overcome these challenges and optimize crop production, we utilize machine\nlearning tools within a virtual field environment to generate localized\nmanagement plans for farmers to manage biotic threats while maximizing profits.\nSpecifically, we present AgGym, a modular, crop and stress agnostic simulation\nframework to model the spread of biotic stresses in a field and estimate yield\nlosses with and without chemical treatments. Our validation with real data\nshows that AgGym can be customized with limited data to simulate yield outcomes\nunder various biotic stress conditions. We further demonstrate that deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies can be trained using AgGym for designing\nultra-precise biotic stress mitigation strategies with potential to increase\nyield recovery with less chemicals and lower cost. Our proposed framework\nenables personalized decision support that can transform biotic stress\nmanagement from being schedule based and reactive to opportunistic and\nprescriptive. We also release the AgGym software implementation as a community\nresource and invite experts to contribute to this open-sourced publicly\navailable modular environment framework.

    "abstract": "Text-attributed graph (TAG) is an important type of graph structured data\nwith text descriptions for each node. Few- and zero-shot node classification on\nTAGs have many applications in fields such as academia and social networks.\nHowever, the two tasks are challenging due to the lack of supervision signals,\nand existing methods only use the contrastive loss to align graph-based node\nembedding and language-based text embedding. In this paper, we propose Hound to\nimprove accuracy by introducing more supervision signals, and the core idea is\nto go beyond the node-text pairs that come with data. Specifically, we design\nthree augmentation techniques, i.e., node perturbation, text matching, and\nsemantics negation to provide more reference nodes for each text and vice\nversa. Node perturbation adds/drops edges to produce diversified node\nembeddings that can be matched with a text. Text matching retrieves texts with\nsimilar embeddings to match with a node. Semantics negation uses a negative\nprompt to construct a negative text with the opposite semantics, which is\ncontrasted with the original node and text. We evaluate Hound on 5 datasets and\ncompare with 13 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that Hound\nconsistently outperforms all baselines, and its accuracy improvements over the\nbest-performing baseline are usually over 5%.",

Existing research has developed methods to generate UWF-FA\nfrom Ultra-Wide-Field Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (UWF-SLO) to reduce the\nadverse reactions associated with injections. However, these methods have been\nless effective in producing high-quality late-phase UWF-FA, particularly in\nlesion areas and fine details. Two primary challenges hinder the generation of\nhigh-quality late-phase UWF-FA: the scarcity of paired UWF-SLO and\nearly/late-phase UWF-FA datasets, and the need for realistic generation at\nlesion sites and potential blood leakage regions. This study introduces an\nimproved latent diffusion model framework to generate high-quality late-phase\nUWF-FA from limited paired UWF images. To address the challenges as mentioned\nearlier, our approach employs a module utilizing Cross-temporal Regional\nDifference Loss, which encourages the model to focus on the differences between\nearly and late phases. Additionally, we introduce a low-frequency enhanced\nnoise strategy in the diffusion forward process to improve the realism of\nmedical images.

To classify ocular diseases, fundus and OCT images\nare the most crucial imaging modalities used in the clinical setting. Most deep\nlearning-based techniques are established on a single imaging modality, which\ncontemplates the ocular disorders to a specific extent and disregards other\nmodality that comprises exhaustive information among distinct imaging\nmodalities. This paper proposes a modality-specific multiscale color space\nembedding integrated with the attention mechanism based on transfer learning\nfor classification (MCGAEc), which can efficiently extract the distinct\nmodality information at various scales using the distinct color spaces. In this\nwork, we first introduce the modality-specific multiscale color space encoder\nmodel, which includes diverse feature representations by integrating distinct\ncharacteristic color spaces on a multiscale into a unified framework. The\nextracted features from the prior encoder module are incorporated with the\nattention mechanism to extract the global features representation, which is\nintegrated with the prior extracted features and transferred to the random\nforest classifier for the classification of AMD.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of location-aware devices, large amount of\ntrajectories have been generated when agents such as people, vehicles and goods\nflow around the urban environment. These raw trajectories, typically collected\nfrom various sources such as GPS in cars, personal mobile devices, and public\ntransport, are often sparse and fragmented due to limited sampling rates,\ninfrastructure coverage and data loss. In this context, trajectory recovery\naims to reconstruct such sparse raw trajectories into their dense and\ncontinuous counterparts, so that fine-grained movement of agents across space\nand time can be captured faithfully. Existing trajectory recovery approaches\ntypically rely on the prior knowledge of travel mode or motion patterns, and\noften fail in densely populated urban areas where accurate maps are absent. In\nthis paper, we present a new recovery framework called TrajWeaver based on\nprobabilistic diffusion models, which is able to recover dense and refined\ntrajectories from the sparse raw ones, conditioned on various auxiliary\nfeatures such as Areas of Interest along the way, user identity and waybill\ninformation. The core of TrajWeaver is a novel State Propagation Diffusion\nModel (SPDM), which introduces a new state propagation mechanism on top of the\nstandard diffusion models, so that knowledge computed in earlier diffusion\nsteps can be reused later, improving the recovery performance while reducing\nthe number of steps needed. Extensive experiments show that the proposed\nTrajWeaver can recover from raw trajectories of various lengths, sparsity\nlevels and heterogeneous travel modes, and outperform the state-of-the-art\nbaselines significantly in recovery accuracy.

In this paper, we present PuYun, an autoregressive\ncascade model that leverages large kernel attention convolutional networks.

The integration of large kernel\nattention mechanisms within the convolutional layers enhances the model's\ncapacity to capture fine-grained spatial details, thereby improving its\npredictive accuracy for meteorological phenomena.\n  We introduce PuYun, comprising PuYun-Short for 0-5 day forecasts and\nPuYun-Medium for 5-10 day predictions. This approach enhances the accuracy of\n10-day weather forecasting. Through evaluation, we demonstrate that PuYun-Short\nalone surpasses the performance of both GraphCast and FuXi-Short in generating\naccurate 10-day forecasts. Specifically, on the 10th day, PuYun-Short reduces\nthe RMSE for Z500 to 720 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 732 $m^2/s^2$ for GraphCast and\n740 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi-Short. Additionally, the RMSE for T2M is reduced to 2.60\nK, compared to 2.63 K for GraphCast and 2.65 K for FuXi-Short. Furthermore,\nwhen employing a cascaded approach by integrating PuYun-Short and PuYun-Medium,\nour method achieves superior results compared to the combined performance of\nFuXi-Short and FuXi-Medium. On the 10th day, the RMSE for Z500 is further\nreduced to 638 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 641 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi.

Lexicon based methods, explainable and easy to implement,\nmatch words from user posts in a depression dictionary without considering\ncontexts. While the DL models can leverage contextual information, their\nblack-box nature limits their adoption in the domain. Though surrogate models\nlike LIME and SHAP can produce explanations for DL models, the explanations are\nsuitable for the developer and of limited use to the end user.

Further, commonsense knowledge from the Commonsense Transformer\n(COMET) trained on ATOMIC is also infused to consider the generic emotional\naspects of user posts in depression detection. The model is evaluated on three\nexpertly curated datasets related to depression. We observed the model to have\na statistically significant (p<0.1) boost in performance over the best\ndomain-specific model, MentalBERT, across CLEF e-Risk (25% MCC increase, 12% F1\nincrease). A similar trend is observed across the PRIMATE dataset, where the\nproposed model performed better than MentalBERT (2.5% MCC increase, 19% F1\nincrease). The observations confirm the generated explanations to be\ninformative for MHPs compared to post hoc model explanations. Results\ndemonstrated that the user-level explainability of KiNN also surpasses the\nperformance of baseline models and can provide explanations where other\nbaselines fall short.

Specifically, it is\nknown that the trajectory of some low-dimensional dynamic systems can fill the\nhigh-dimensional space eventually. Thus, hyper-compression, using these dynamic\nsystems as the hyperfunctions, represents the parameters of the target network\nby their corresponding composition number or trajectory length. This suggests a\nnovel mechanism for model compression, substantially different from the\nexisting pruning, quantization, distillation, and decomposition. Along this\ndirection, we methodologically identify a suitable dynamic system with the\nirrational winding as the hyperfunction and theoretically derive its associated\nerror bound. Next, guided by our theoretical insights, we propose several\nengineering twists to make the hyper-compression pragmatic and effective.\nLastly, systematic and comprehensive experiments confirm that hyper-compression\nenjoys the following \\textbf{PNAS} merits: 1) \\textbf{P}referable compression\nratio; 2) \\textbf{N}o post-hoc retraining; 3) \\textbf{A}ffordable inference\ntime; and 4) \\textbf{S}hort compression time. It compresses LLaMA2-7B in an\nhour and achieves close-to-int4-quantization performance, without retraining\nand with a performance drop of less than 1\\%.

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) are\npowerful in attaining state-of-the-art machine learning models, with Bayesian\noptimization (BO) standing out as a mainstream method. Extending BO into the\nmulti-fidelity setting has been an emerging research topic, but faces the\nchallenge of determining an appropriate fidelity for each hyperparameter\nconfiguration to fit the surrogate model. To tackle the challenge, we propose a\nmulti-fidelity BO method named FastBO, which adaptively decides the fidelity\nfor each configuration and efficiently offers strong performance. The\nadvantages are achieved based on the novel concepts of efficient point and\nsaturation point for each configuration.We also show that our adaptive fidelity\nidentification strategy provides a way to extend any single-fidelity method to\nthe multi-fidelity setting, highlighting its generality and applicability.",

    "abstract": "With the recent unprecedented advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ncomputing, progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) is accelerating rapidly,\npresenting challenges in establishing clear guidelines, particularly in the\nfield of security. That being said, we thoroughly identify and describe three\nmain technical challenges in the security and software engineering literature\nthat spans the entire LLM workflow, namely; \\textbf{\\textit{(i)}} Data\nCollection and Labeling; \\textbf{\\textit{(ii)}} System Design and Learning; and\n\\textbf{\\textit{(iii)}} Performance Evaluation. Building upon these challenges,\nthis paper introduces \\texttt{SecRepair}, an instruction-based LLM system\ndesigned to reliably \\textit{identify}, \\textit{describe}, and automatically\n\\textit{repair} vulnerable source code. Our system is accompanied by a list of\nactionable guides on \\textbf{\\textit{(i)}} Data Preparation and Augmentation\nTechniques; \\textbf{\\textit{(ii)}} Selecting and Adapting state-of-the-art LLM\nModels; \\textbf{\\textit{(iii)}} Evaluation Procedures. \\texttt{SecRepair} uses\na reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning with a semantic reward that caters\nto the functionality and security aspects of the generated code. Our empirical\nanalysis shows that \\texttt{SecRepair} achieves a \\textit{12}\\% improvement in\nsecurity code repair compared to other LLMs when trained using reinforcement\nlearning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of \\texttt{SecRepair} in\ngenerating reliable, functional, and compilable security code repairs against\nreal-world test cases using automated evaluation metrics.",

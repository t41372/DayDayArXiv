    "abstract": "AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries. Recently, linear classifiers (called \"deception probes\") have been trained to distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.",

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details. Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries, comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.",

    "abstract": "Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS (Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

Early screening for these diseases is essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.\n  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity. Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b) Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions; and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets, both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.\n  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images. The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.\n  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases, generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times computationally efficient compared to having five individual models corresponding to each disease.",

We present an automated design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model (LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or (ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal. We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical, scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.",

Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of gradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient fluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second, the direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can incur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient Matching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient matching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data and apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we maximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from the empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory. By doing so, the aggregate gradient can incorporate knowledge from all domains without suffering gradient fluctuation towards any particular domain. Experimental evaluations on datasets from DomainBed demonstrate competitive results yielded by POGM against other baselines while achieving computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process, making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all without a significant increase in computational cost.

Given the vast and impressive common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite, VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks.

    "abstract": "Channel estimation is crucial in wireless communications. However, in many papers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error (MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, trained neural networks require no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.\n  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead.",

    "abstract": "Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \\% on STPCTLS, outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\\% accuracy (6.1\\% improvement compared to MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\\% on ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy. Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud processing applications.

    "abstract": "The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed, grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning. We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions \"What\" and \"How\". The first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community. Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data. However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.",

    "abstract": "Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.\n  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs, and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.\n  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process, which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e., whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al., 2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps, layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants' ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.",

What permits us to draw in globally relevant information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language; (ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains.",

However, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion: they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 7.7% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world models for test-time scaling.",

A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze.

In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.",

However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving performance on downstream tasks.",

Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps, showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify, which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and can lead to different global behaviors.",

However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.\n  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.",

In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data.

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.",

    "abstract": "Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval. The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot",

Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\\% to 40\\% with a comparable/higher accuracy.

    "abstract": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ (HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset.

In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover, temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting, and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P). Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.",

Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.",

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation, where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses, they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently. FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class. Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation, overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as \"superposition catastrophe\" and \"the problem of 2\". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network, FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.",

Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically, the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel. We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates $δ\\in\\{0.01, 0.1\\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have applications in future technologies like DNA storage.",

This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.",

This paper presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization capabilities.

    "abstract": "While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense framework that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL.",

    "abstract": "The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.

    "abstract": "Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code at https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.",

    "abstract": "SHACL and OWL are two prominent W3C standards for managing RDF data. These languages share many features, but they have one fundamental difference: OWL, designed for inferring facts from incomplete data, makes the open-world assumption, whereas SHACL is a constraint language that treats the data as complete and must be validated under the closed-world assumption. The combination of both formalisms is very appealing and has been called for, but their semantic gap is a major challenge, semantically and computationally. In this paper, we advocate a semantics for SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies based on core universal models. We provide a technique for constructing these models for ontologies in the rich data-tractable description logic Horn-ALCHIQ. Furthermore, we use a finite representation of this model to develop a rewriting technique that reduces SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies to standard validation. Finally, we study the complexity of SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies, and show that even very simple ontologies make the problem EXPTIME-complete, and PTIME-complete in data complexity.",

We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages.

    "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure. Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes place when recommender systems are almost \"too good\", making recommendations so tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape? Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of view.",

Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy.

This study investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs. These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI development.",

    "abstract": "Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics. Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic. This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.",

    "abstract": "Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.\n  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior, providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.",

The Interpretable Generalization (IG) mechanism, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, eliminates that bottleneck by learning coherent patterns - feature combinations unique to benign or malicious traffic - and turning them into fully auditable rules. IG already delivers outstanding precision, recall, and AUC on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and UKM-IDS20, even when trained on only 10% of the data. To raise precision further without sacrificing transparency, we introduce Multi-Granular Discretization (IG-MD), which represents every continuous feature at several Gaussian-based resolutions. On UKM-IDS20, IG-MD lifts precision by greater than or equal to 4 percentage points across all nine train-test splits while preserving recall approximately equal to 1.0, demonstrating that a single interpretation-ready model can scale across domains without bespoke tuning.",

Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances, speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies: the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity, general-purpose speech and audio generation.",

Machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and image processing with the integration of computer scientists into multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling (SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.",

    "abstract": "Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues, quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the original model.",

To ensure fair comparison, we propose a weighted ranking metric that integrates accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and training time. Results demonstrate that no single RL method dominates universally, the performance dependents on task type, qubit count, and noise conditions providing strong evidence of no free lunch principle in RL-QAS. As a byproduct we observe that a carefully chosen RL algorithm in RL-based VQC outperforms baseline VQCs. BenchRL-QAS establishes the most extensive benchmark for RL-based QAS to date, codes and experimental made publicly available for reproducibility and future advances.",

    "abstract": "Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.",

Empirical evaluations on two large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150 planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.",

This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering, supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively. Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.",

On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.",

    "abstract": "The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL) method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions: First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow, effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.",

    "abstract": "The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing (iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS, encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However, challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.",

Babel employs two key components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing, medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.",

When it comes to evaluating long texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap, we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.",

While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence functions not as an epistemic leveller, but as an accelerant of cognitive stratification, entrenching and formalising informational castes within liberal-democratic societies. Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation, whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued. Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy as a civic mandate, codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area, existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level, we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

Existing methods regard the RGB domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids. Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on the FLIR-ADAS dataset.",

However, in many practical scenarios, the available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.",

In this paper, we reframe masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for domain-adaptive segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings. The code is available at https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/FDAM.",

To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.",

We train a 1000-step denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and discuss the results for varying process representations.

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.",

These certificates, such as barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified, serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the certificates.",

    "abstract": "Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables $ξ$ scaling each unit in the networks. The stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo) and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.",

Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP, we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.",

To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns. We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to 1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini (0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of improvement.",

Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships between instances.

However, the inherent mobility and high-altitude operation of NTN pose significant challenges throughout the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. To address these challenges, integrating NTNs with the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) is a promising approach, since ORAN can offer disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive literature on ORAN and NTN, a holistic view of ORAN-based NTN frameworks is still lacking, particularly regarding how ORAN can effectively address the existing challenges of NTN. Furthermore, although artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities have the potential to enhance intelligence network control and optimization, their practical realization in NTNs has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of AI-Native ORAN for NTN. This paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature and subsequently introduces the necessary background about ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. After analyzing the DevOps challenges for NTN, we propose the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework and discuss its key technological enablers.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search algorithms. This hardware has been exploited in best-first search algorithms with neural network-based heuristics by creating batched versions of A* and Weighted A* that delay heuristic evaluation until sufficiently many states can be evaluated in parallel on the GPU. But, research has not addressed how depth-first algorithms like IDA* or Budgeted Tree Search (BTS) can have their heuristic computations batched. This is more complicated in a tree search, because progress in the search tree is blocked until heuristic evaluations are complete. In this paper we show that GPU parallelization of heuristics can be effectively performed when the tree search is parallelized on the CPU while heuristic evaluations are parallelized on the GPU. We develop a parallelized cost-bounded depth-first search (CB-DFS) framework that can be applied to both IDA* and BTS, significantly improving their performance. We demonstrate the strength of the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and the 4x4 sliding tile puzzle (STP) with both classifier-based and regression-based heuristics.",

    "abstract": "High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in terms of both UAR and WAR.",

    "abstract": "Reusing established theorems and formulas is central to mathematical problem solving, serving as essential building blocks for tackling increasingly complex challenges. Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and reusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an ensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and reusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only performs direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al., 2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often trivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from self-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on MATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does not come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget spent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small correction in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism, boosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\\% in accuracy. After matching for compute, the benefit of TroVE reduces to a marginal improvement of 1\\%, suggesting that this toolbox approach does not provide a significant benefit on MATH.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits, such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant. Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming, legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics, enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes: individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\\textit{Tree-MNIST} and \\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\\% automatic categorization accuracy and 80\\% time savings compared to manual approaches.",

    "abstract": "Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of increasingly autonomous AI-driven science.

We attempt to reproduce and reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and category-sensitive patterns.",

    "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset, which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU). CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training. Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in\ncomprehending and generating text, motivating numerous researchers to utilize\nthem for Information Extraction (IE) purposes, including Relation Extraction\n(RE). Nonetheless, most existing methods are predominantly designed for\nSentence-level Relation Extraction (SentRE) tasks, which typically encompass a\nrestricted set of relations and triplet facts within a single sentence.\nFurthermore, certain approaches resort to treating relations as candidate\nchoices integrated into prompt templates, leading to inefficient processing and\nsuboptimal performance when tackling Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE)\ntasks, which entail handling multiple relations and triplet facts distributed\nacross a given document, posing distinct challenges. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce AutoRE, an end-to-end DocRE model that adopts a novel\nRE extraction paradigm named RHF (Relation-Head-Facts). Unlike existing\napproaches, AutoRE does not rely on the assumption of known relation options,\nmaking it more reflective of real-world scenarios. Additionally, we have\ndeveloped an easily extensible RE framework using a Parameters Efficient Fine\nTuning (PEFT) algorithm (QLoRA). Our experiments on the RE-DocRED dataset\nshowcase AutoRE's best performance, achieving state-of-the-art results,\nsurpassing TAG by 10.03\\% and 9.03\\% respectively on the dev and test set.

    "abstract": "This work explores the potential of using differentiable simulation for\nlearning quadruped locomotion. Differentiable simulation promises fast\nconvergence and stable training by computing low-variance first-order gradients\nusing robot dynamics. However, its usage for legged robots is still limited to\nsimulation. The main challenge lies in the complex optimization landscape of\nrobotic tasks due to discontinuous dynamics. This work proposes a new\ndifferentiable simulation framework to overcome these challenges. Our approach\ncombines a high-fidelity, non-differentiable simulator for forward dynamics\nwith a simplified surrogate model for gradient backpropagation. This approach\nmaintains simulation accuracy by aligning the robot states from the surrogate\nmodel with those of the precise, non-differentiable simulator. Our framework\nenables learning quadruped walking in simulation in minutes without\nparallelization. When augmented with GPU parallelization, our approach allows\nthe quadruped robot to master diverse locomotion skills on challenging terrains\nin minutes. We demonstrate that differentiable simulation outperforms a\nreinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) by achieving significantly better sample\nefficiency while maintaining its effectiveness in handling large-scale\nenvironments. Our method represents one of the first successful applications of\ndifferentiable simulation to real-world quadruped locomotion, offering a\ncompelling alternative to traditional RL methods.",

    "abstract": "Semantic plausibility (e.g. knowing that \"the actor won the award\" is more\nlikely than \"the actor won the battle\") serves as an effective proxy for\ngeneral world knowledge. Language models (LMs) capture vast amounts of world\nknowledge by learning distributional patterns in text, accessible via log\nprobabilities (LogProbs) they assign to plausible vs. implausible outputs. The\nnew generation of instruction-tuned LMs can now also provide explicit estimates\nof plausibility via prompting. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of LogProbs\nand basic prompting to measure semantic plausibility, both in single-sentence\nminimal pairs (Experiment 1) and short context-dependent scenarios (Experiment\n2). We find that (i) in both base and instruction-tuned LMs, LogProbs offers a\nmore reliable measure of semantic plausibility than direct zero-shot prompting,\nwhich yields inconsistent and often poor results; (ii) instruction-tuning\ngenerally does not alter the sensitivity of LogProbs to semantic plausibility\n(although sometimes decreases it); (iii) across models, context mostly\nmodulates LogProbs in expected ways, as measured by three novel metrics of\ncontext-sensitive plausibility and their match to explicit human plausibility\njudgments. We conclude that, even in the era of prompt-based evaluations,\nLogProbs constitute a useful metric of semantic plausibility, both in base and\ninstruction-tuned LMs.",

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\nhas come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale\nsolutions to support mental health.

In this paper, we summarize the\nextant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education,\nassessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive\nimpact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application\nto mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these\nrisks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with\nresponsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is\nespecially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental\nhealth, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that\npeople, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are\ninvolved in all stages from development through deployment.

Recently, situated temporal planning was\nintroduced, where planning starts at time 0 and execution occurs after planning\nterminates. Situated temporal planning reflects a more realistic scenario where\ntime passes during planning. However, in situated temporal planning a complete\nplan must be generated before any action is executed. In some problems with\ntime pressure, timing is too tight to complete planning before the first action\nmust be executed. For example, an autonomous car that has a truck backing\ntowards it should probably move out of the way now and plan how to get to its\ndestination later. In this paper, we propose a new problem setting: concurrent\nplanning and execution, in which actions can be dispatched (executed) before\nplanning terminates. Unlike previous work on planning and execution, we must\nhandle wall clock deadlines that affect action applicability and goal\nachievement (as in situated planning) while also supporting dispatching actions\nbefore a complete plan has been found. We extend previous work on metareasoning\nfor situated temporal planning to develop an algorithm for this new setting.\nOur empirical evaluation shows that when there is strong time pressure, our\napproach outperforms situated temporal planning.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos\nthat follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual\ncontent. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video\ngeneration (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively\nextended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of\n80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components\nare:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),\nwhich conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the\nprevious chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk\ntransitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation\nmodule, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first\nvideo chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a\nrandomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer\nautoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between\nchunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In\ncontrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation\nwhen applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with\nStreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that\noutperforms competitors with consistency and motion.

    "abstract": "Recent model inversion attack algorithms permit adversaries to reconstruct a\nneural network's private and potentially sensitive training data by repeatedly\nquerying the network. In this work, we develop a novel network architecture\nthat leverages sparse-coding layers to obtain superior robustness to this class\nof attacks. Three decades of computer science research has studied sparse\ncoding in the context of image denoising, object recognition, and adversarial\nmisclassification settings, but to the best of our knowledge, its connection to\nstate-of-the-art privacy vulnerabilities remains unstudied. In this work, we\nhypothesize that sparse coding architectures suggest an advantageous means to\ndefend against model inversion attacks because they allow us to control the\namount of irrelevant private information encoded by a network in a manner that\nis known to have little effect on classification accuracy. Specifically,\ncompared to networks trained with a variety of state-of-the-art defenses, our\nsparse-coding architectures maintain comparable or higher classification\naccuracy while degrading state-of-the-art training data reconstructions by\nfactors of 1.1 to 18.3 across a variety of reconstruction quality metrics\n(PSNR, SSIM, FID). This performance advantage holds across 5 datasets ranging\nfrom CelebA faces to medical images and CIFAR-10, and across various\nstate-of-the-art SGD-based and GAN-based inversion attacks, including\nPlug-&-Play attacks.

We investigate current benchmarks to\nincorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which\npotentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the\ninput diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math\nbenchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We\nmeticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with\ndiagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by\nhuman annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of\ninformation content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in\ntotal. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how\nmuch MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning.\nIn addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a\nfine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True\nor False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and\nthen score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the\nintermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark\nmay provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project\npage: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io",

Differentiable programming is not merely the\ndifferentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs\nintended for differentiation.

    "abstract": "Language agents have demonstrated autonomous decision-making abilities by\nreasoning with foundation models. Recently, efforts have been made to train\nlanguage agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and\naction trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories\nstill requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotation or\nimplementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose\nA$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent\nTrajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting\nagent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly\nsampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent\nwith the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then\nsynthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled\naction. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for\nthe failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed\ntrajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods\nwith binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated\ntrajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent\nself-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the\nopen-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with\nA$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative\nrounds. In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human\naverage, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance\napproaching human experts. A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing\ntechniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and\nfully fine-tuned LLMs.",

Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors\nthat manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens\n(known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors,\nincluding humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors.\nCollectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic\ntokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these\norchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching\nin semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct\nparallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves\ncrafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for\nextracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the\nsemantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective\non the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much\ngreater complexity and capabilities.

Current approaches for this task heavily\ndepend on having a significant number of training instances to handle objects\nwith pronounced visual and/or geometric part ambiguities. Our work explores the\ngrounding of fine-grained part descriptors for precise manipulation in a\nzero-shot setting by utilizing web-trained text-to-image diffusion-based\ngenerative models. We tackle the problem by framing it as a dense semantic part\ncorrespondence task. Our model returns a gripper pose for manipulating a\nspecific part, using as reference a user-defined click from a source image of a\nvisually different instance of the same object. We require no manual grasping\ndemonstrations as we leverage the intrinsic object geometry and features.\nPractical experiments in a real-world tabletop scenario validate the efficacy\nof our approach, demonstrating its potential for advancing semantic-aware\nrobotics manipulation.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied to many control tasks and\nsubstantially improved the performances compared to conventional control\nmethods in many domains where the reward function is well defined. However, for\nmany real-world problems, it is often more convenient to formulate optimization\nproblems in terms of rewards and constraints simultaneously. Optimizing such\nconstrained problems via reward shaping can be difficult as it requires tedious\nmanual tuning of reward functions with several interacting terms. Recent\nformulations which include constraints mostly require a pre-training phase,\nwhich often needs human expertise to collect data or assumes having a\nsub-optimal policy readily available. We propose a new constrained RL method\ncalled CSAC-LB (Constrained Soft Actor-Critic with Log Barrier Function), which\nachieves competitive performance without any pre-training by applying a linear\nsmoothed log barrier function to an additional safety critic. It implements an\nadaptive penalty for policy learning and alleviates the numerical issues that\nare known to complicate the application of the log barrier function method. As\na result, we show that with CSAC-LB, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nseveral constrained control tasks with different levels of difficulty and\nevaluate our methods in a locomotion task on a real quadruped robot platform.",

    "abstract": "Traditional knowledge distillation (KD) relies on a proficient teacher\ntrained on the target task, which is not always available. In this setting,\ncross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model\ntrained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when\napplied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a\nsimple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this\ndrop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to\ndisregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's\nperformance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending\nmany KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks\ncan be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the\ncross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional\ncost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%)\nwhen using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depth\nestimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack of\nany learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analytical\ninsights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the\ndistillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral\nregularisation component. Through this analysis we are additionally able to\npropose a novel regularisation loss that allows teacher-free distillation,\nenabling performance improvements of up to 8.57% on ImageNet with no additional\ntraining costs.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the buyer's inspection paradox for information markets.\nThe paradox is that buyers need to access information to determine its value,\nwhile sellers need to limit access to prevent theft. To study this, we\nintroduce an open-source simulated digital marketplace where intelligent\nagents, powered by language models, buy and sell information on behalf of\nexternal participants. The central mechanism enabling this marketplace is the\nagents' dual capabilities: they not only have the capacity to assess the\nquality of privileged information but also come equipped with the ability to\nforget. This ability to induce amnesia allows vendors to grant temporary access\nto proprietary information, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized\nretention while enabling agents to accurately gauge the information's relevance\nto specific queries or tasks. To perform well, agents must make rational\ndecisions, strategically explore the marketplace through generated sub-queries,\nand synthesize answers from purchased information. Concretely, our experiments\n(a) uncover biases in language models leading to irrational behavior and\nevaluate techniques to mitigate these biases, (b) investigate how price affects\ndemand in the context of informational goods, and (c) show that inspection and\nhigher budgets both lead to higher quality outcomes.",

In this paper, we extend\ngradient-based CAM techniques to work with binary classifiers and visualize the\nactive regions for binary facial attribute classifiers. When training an\nunbalanced binary classifier on an imbalanced dataset, it is well-known that\nthe majority class, i.e. the class with many training samples, is mostly\npredicted much better than minority class with few training instances. In our\nexperiments on the CelebA dataset, we verify these results, when training an\nunbalanced classifier to extract 40 facial attributes simultaneously. One would\nexpect that the biased classifier has learned to extract features mainly for\nthe majority classes and that the proportional energy of the activations mainly\nreside in certain specific regions of the image where the attribute is located.\nHowever, we find very little regular activation for samples of majority\nclasses, while the active regions for minority classes seem mostly reasonable\nand overlap with our expectations. These results suggest that biased\nclassifiers mainly rely on bias activation for majority classes.

Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which\nallows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image\ngeneration and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream\ntask, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to\nextract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges\nstyle information from multiple style inputs.

We further\ndemonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge\nabout tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic\nimages with known layouts.

Remarkably, in\nthe most challenging open-partial-set scenarios, GLC and GLC++ surpass GATE by\n16.7% and 18.6% in H-score on VisDA, respectively.

The experimental\nresults indicate that the primary contributors to gender bias are the bottom\nMLP modules acting on the last token of occupational pronouns and the top\nattention module acting on the final word in the sentence.

However, off-target translation remains an unsolved\nproblem, especially for low-resource languages, hindering us from developing\naccurate LLMs-based translation models. To mitigate the off-target translation\nproblem and enhance the performance of LLMs on translation, recent works have\neither designed advanced prompting strategies to highlight the functionality of\ntranslation instructions or exploited the in-context learning ability of LLMs\nby feeding few-shot demonstrations. However, these methods essentially do not\nimprove LLM's ability to follow translation instructions, especially the\nlanguage direction information. In this work, we design a two-stage fine-tuning\nalgorithm to improve the instruction-following ability (especially the\ntranslation direction) of LLMs. Specifically, we first tune LLMs with the\nmaximum likelihood estimation loss on the translation dataset to elicit the\nbasic translation capabilities. In the second stage, we construct\ninstruction-conflicting samples by randomly replacing the translation\ndirections with a wrong one within the instruction, and then introduce an extra\nunlikelihood loss to learn those samples. Experiments on IWSLT and WMT\nbenchmarks upon the LLaMA model spanning 16 zero-shot directions show that,\ncompared to the competitive baseline -- translation-finetuned LLama, our method\ncould effectively reduce the off-target translation ratio (averagely -53.3\\%),\nthus improving translation quality with average +5.7 SacreBLEU and +16.4\nBLEURT.

    "abstract": "In federated learning, data heterogeneity significantly impacts performance.\nA typical solution involves segregating these parameters into shared and\npersonalized components, a concept also relevant in multi-task learning.\nAddressing this, we propose \"Loop Improvement\" (LI), a novel method enhancing\nthis separation and feature extraction without necessitating a central server\nor data interchange among participants. Our experiments reveal LI's superiority\nin several aspects: In personalized federated learning environments, LI\nconsistently outperforms the advanced FedALA algorithm in accuracy across\ndiverse scenarios. Additionally, LI's feature extractor closely matches the\nperformance achieved when aggregating data from all clients. In global model\ncontexts, employing LI with stacked personalized layers and an additional\nnetwork also yields comparable results to combined client data scenarios.\nFurthermore, LI's adaptability extends to multi-task learning, streamlining the\nextraction of common features across tasks and obviating the need for\nsimultaneous training. This approach not only enhances individual task\nperformance but also achieves accuracy levels on par with classic multi-task\nlearning methods where all tasks are trained simultaneously. LI integrates a\nloop topology with layer-wise and end-to-end training, compatible with various\nneural network models. This paper also delves into the theoretical\nunderpinnings of LI's effectiveness, offering insights into its potential\napplications. The code is on https://github.com/axedge1983/LI",

Our evaluations demonstrate that\nLLMs, particularly GPT-4, exhibit preliminary abilities in graph generation\ntasks, including rule-based and distribution-based generation. We also observe\nthat popular prompting methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought\nprompting, do not consistently enhance performance.

    "abstract": "Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and encompass a diverse range\nof tasks, from node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks to transfer learning.\nHowever, designing specific tasks for each type of graph data is often costly\nand lacks generalizability. Recent endeavors under the \"Pre-training +\nFine-tuning\" or \"Pre-training + Prompt\" paradigms aim to design a unified\nframework capable of generalizing across multiple graph tasks. Among these,\ngraph autoencoders (GAEs), generative self-supervised models, have demonstrated\ntheir potential in effectively addressing various graph tasks. Nevertheless,\nthese methods typically employ multi-stage training and require adaptive\ndesigns, which on one hand make it difficult to be seamlessly applied to\ndiverse graph tasks and on the other hand overlook the negative impact caused\nby discrepancies in task objectives between the different stages. To address\nthese challenges, we propose GA^2E, a unified adversarially masked autoencoder\ncapable of addressing the above challenges seamlessly. Specifically, GA^2E\nproposes to use the subgraph as the meta-structure, which remains consistent\nacross all graph tasks (ranging from node-, edge-, and graph-level to transfer\nlearning) and all stages (both during training and inference). Further, GA^2E\noperates in a \\textbf{\"Generate then Discriminate\"} manner. It leverages the\nmasked GAE to reconstruct the input subgraph whilst treating it as a generator\nto compel the reconstructed graphs resemble the input subgraph. Furthermore,\nGA^2E introduces an auxiliary discriminator to discern the authenticity between\nthe reconstructed (generated) subgraph and the input subgraph, thus ensuring\nthe robustness of the graph representation through adversarial training\nmechanisms. We validate GA^2E's capabilities through extensive experiments on\n21 datasets across four types of graph tasks.",

However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks,\nincluding their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number\nof hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data\nportions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more\neffective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and\nTask-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\\nabla \\tau$), an optimization framework\ndesigned to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It\napplies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using\nstandard gradient descent for the remaining data. $\\nabla \\tau$ offers multiple\nbenefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections\nof the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various\nunlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable\nacross different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $\\nabla \\tau$\nrequires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than\nretraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness\nusing a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics,\ndemonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to remarkable\nachievements in robot locomotion capabilities. However, the complexity and\n``black-box'' nature of neural network-based RL policies hinder their\ninterpretability and broader acceptance, particularly in applications demanding\nhigh levels of safety and reliability. This paper introduces a novel approach\nto distill neural RL policies into more interpretable forms using Gradient\nBoosting Machines (GBMs), Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) and Symbolic\nRegression. By leveraging the inherent interpretability of generalized additive\nmodels, decision trees, and analytical expressions, we transform opaque neural\nnetwork policies into more transparent ``glass-box'' models. We train expert\nneural network policies using RL and subsequently distill them into (i) GBMs,\n(ii) EBMs, and (iii) symbolic policies. To address the inherent distribution\nshift challenge of behavioral cloning, we propose to use the Dataset\nAggregation (DAgger) algorithm with a curriculum of episode-dependent\nalternation of actions between expert and distilled policies, to enable\nefficient distillation of feedback control policies. We evaluate our approach\non various robot locomotion gaits -- walking, trotting, bounding, and pacing --\nand study the importance of different observations in joint actions for\ndistilled policies using various methods. We train neural expert policies for\n205 hours of simulated experience and distill interpretable policies with only\n10 minutes of simulated interaction for each gait using the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Learning dexterous locomotion policy for legged robots is becoming\nincreasingly popular due to its ability to handle diverse terrains and resemble\nintelligent behaviors. However, joint manipulation of moving objects and\nlocomotion with legs, such as playing soccer, receive scant attention in the\nlearning community, although it is natural for humans and smart animals. A key\nchallenge to solve this multitask problem is to infer the objectives of\nlocomotion from the states and targets of the manipulated objects. The implicit\nrelation between the object states and robot locomotion can be hard to capture\ndirectly from the training experience. We propose adding a feedback control\nblock to compute the necessary body-level movement accurately and using the\noutputs as dynamic joint-level locomotion supervision explicitly. We further\nutilize an improved ball dynamic model, an extended context-aided estimator,\nand a comprehensive ball observer to facilitate transferring policy learned in\nsimulation to the real world. We observe that our learning scheme can not only\nmake the policy network converge faster but also enable soccer robots to\nperform sophisticated maneuvers like sharp cuts and turns on flat surfaces, a\ncapability that was lacking in previous methods.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes LayoutLLM, a more flexible document analysis method for\nunderstanding imaged documents. Visually Rich Document Understanding tasks,\nsuch as document image classification and information extraction, have gained\nsignificant attention due to their importance. Existing methods have been\ndeveloped to enhance document comprehension by incorporating pre-training\nawareness of images, text, and layout structure. However, these methods require\nfine-tuning for each task and dataset, and the models are expensive to train\nand operate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new LayoutLLM that\nintegrates these with large-scale language models (LLMs). By leveraging the\nstrengths of existing research in document image understanding and LLMs'\nsuperior language understanding capabilities, the proposed model, fine-tuned\nwith multimodal instruction datasets, performs an understanding of document\nimages in a single model. Our experiments demonstrate improvement over the\nbaseline model in various document analysis tasks.",

To effectively aggregate these multimodal features, we employed a\ncross-attention mechanism. MOGAM achieved an accuracy of 0.871 and an F1-score\nof 0.888. Moreover, to validate the scalability of MOGAM, we evaluated its\nperformance with a benchmark dataset and achieved comparable results with prior\nstudies (0.61 F1-score).

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly enhance human\nperformance across various domains. Ideally, collaboration between humans and\nAI should result in complementary team performance (CTP) -- a level of\nperformance that neither of them can attain individually. So far, however, CTP\nhas rarely been observed, suggesting an insufficient understanding of the\nprinciple and the application of complementarity. Therefore, we develop a\ngeneral concept of complementarity and formalize its theoretical potential as\nwell as the actual realized effect in decision-making situations. Moreover, we\nidentify information and capability asymmetry as the two key sources of\ncomplementarity. Finally, we illustrate the impact of each source on\ncomplementarity potential and effect in two empirical studies. Our work\nprovides researchers with a comprehensive theoretical foundation of human-AI\ncomplementarity in decision-making and demonstrates that leveraging these\nsources constitutes a viable pathway towards designing effective human-AI\ncollaboration, i.e., the realization of CTP.",

PMD can be seen as a soft Policy Iteration\nalgorithm implementing regularized 1-step greedy policy improvement. However,\n1-step greedy policies might not be the best choice and recent remarkable\nempirical successes in RL such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero have demonstrated that\ngreedy approaches with respect to multiple steps outperform their 1-step\ncounterpart. In this work, we propose a new class of PMD algorithms called\n$h$-PMD which incorporates multi-step greedy policy improvement with lookahead\ndepth $h$ to the PMD update rule. To solve discounted infinite horizon Markov\nDecision Processes with discount factor $\\gamma$, we show that $h$-PMD which\ngeneralizes the standard PMD enjoys a faster dimension-free $\\gamma^h$-linear\nconvergence rate, contingent on the computation of multi-step greedy policies.\nWe propose an inexact version of $h$-PMD where lookahead action values are\nestimated. Under a generative model, we establish a sample complexity for\n$h$-PMD which improves over prior work. Finally, we extend our result to linear\nfunction approximation to scale to large state spaces.

A noteworthy development in IIoT is\nthe integration of federated learning (FL), which addresses data privacy and\nsecurity among devices. FL enables edge sensors, also known as peripheral\nintelligence units (PIUs) to learn and adapt using their data locally, without\nexplicit sharing of confidential data, to facilitate a collaborative yet\nconfidential learning process.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 appeared abruptly in early 2020, requiring a rapid response amid a\ncontext of great uncertainty. Good quality data and knowledge was initially\nlacking, and many early models had to be developed with causal assumptions and\nestimations built in to supplement limited data, often with no reliable\napproach for identifying, validating and documenting these causal assumptions.\nOur team embarked on a knowledge engineering process to develop a causal\nknowledge base consisting of several causal BNs for diverse aspects of\nCOVID-19. The unique challenges of the setting lead to experiments with the\nelicitation approach, and what emerged was a knowledge engineering method we\ncall Causal Knowledge Engineering (CKE). The CKE provides a structured approach\nfor building a causal knowledge base that can support the development of a\nvariety of application-specific models. Here we describe the CKE method, and\nuse our COVID-19 work as a case study to provide a detailed discussion and\nanalysis of the method.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning workloads significantly increase energy consumption,\nsustainable data centers with low carbon emissions are becoming a top priority\nfor governments and corporations worldwide. This requires a paradigm shift in\noptimizing power consumption in cooling and IT loads, shifting flexible loads\nbased on the availability of renewable energy in the power grid, and leveraging\nbattery storage from the uninterrupted power supply in data centers, using\ncollaborative agents. The complex association between these optimization\nstrategies and their dependencies on variable external factors like weather and\nthe power grid carbon intensity makes this a hard problem. Currently, a\nreal-time controller to optimize all these goals simultaneously in a dynamic\nreal-world setting is lacking. We propose a Data Center Carbon Footprint\nReduction (DC-CFR) multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that\noptimizes data centers for the multiple objectives of carbon footprint\nreduction, energy consumption, and energy cost. The results show that the\nDC-CFR MARL agents effectively resolved the complex interdependencies in\noptimizing cooling, load shifting, and energy storage in real-time for various\nlocations under real-world dynamic weather and grid carbon intensity\nconditions. DC-CFR significantly outperformed the industry standard ASHRAE\ncontroller with a considerable reduction in carbon emissions (14.5%), energy\nusage (14.4%), and energy cost (13.7%) when evaluated over one year across\nmultiple geographical regions.",

    "abstract": "Google AI systems exhibit patterns mirroring antisocial personality disorder\n(ASPD), consistent across models from Bard on PaLM to Gemini Advanced, meeting\n5 out of 7 ASPD modified criteria. These patterns, along with comparable\ncorporate behaviors, are scrutinized using an ASPD-inspired framework,\nemphasizing the heuristic value in assessing AI's human impact. Independent\nanalyses by ChatGPT 4 and Claude 3.0 Opus of the Google interactions, alongside\nAI self-reflection, validate these concerns, highlighting behaviours analogous\nto deceit, manipulation, and safety neglect.\n  The analogy of ASPD underscores the dilemma: just as we would hesitate to\nentrust our homes or personal devices to someone with psychopathic traits, we\nmust critically evaluate the trustworthiness of AI systems and their\ncreators.This research advocates for an integrated AI ethics approach, blending\ntechnological evaluation, human-AI interaction, and corporate behavior\nscrutiny. AI self-analysis sheds light on internal biases, stressing the need\nfor multi-sectoral collaboration for robust ethical guidelines and oversight.\n  Given the persistent unethical behaviors in Google AI, notably with potential\nGemini integration in iOS affecting billions, immediate ethical scrutiny is\nimperative. The trust we place in AI systems, akin to the trust in individuals,\nnecessitates rigorous ethical evaluation. Would we knowingly trust our home,\nour children or our personal computer to human with ASPD.?\n  Urging Google and the AI community to address these ethical challenges\nproactively, this paper calls for transparent dialogues and a commitment to\nhigher ethical standards, ensuring AI's societal benefit and moral integrity.\nThe urgency for ethical action is paramount, reflecting the vast influence and\npotential of AI technologies in our lives.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of generative technology opens up possibility for\nhigher level of automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) embodiment in\nrobotic systems is imminent. However, due to the blackbox nature of the\ngenerative technology, the generation of the knowledge and workflow scheme is\nuncontrolled, especially in a dynamic environment and a complex scene. This\nposes challenges to regulations in safety-demanding applications such as\nmedical scenes. We argue that the unregulated generative processes from AI is\nfitted for low level end tasks, but intervention in the form of manual or\nautomated regulation should happen post-workflow-generation and\npre-robotic-execution. To address this, we propose a roadmap that can lead to\nfully automated and regulated robotic systems. In this paradigm, the high level\npolicies are generated as structured graph data, enabling regulatory oversight\nand reusability, while the code base for lower level tasks is generated by\ngenerative models. Our approach aims the transitioning from expert knowledge to\nregulated action, akin to the iterative processes of study, practice, scrutiny,\nand execution in human tasks. We identify the generative and deterministic\nprocesses in a design cycle, where generative processes serve as a text-based\nworld simulator and the deterministic processes generate the executable system.\nWe propose State Machine Seralization Language (SMSL) to be the conversion\npoint between text simulator and executable workflow control. From there, we\nanalyze the modules involved based on the current literature, and discuss human\nin the loop. As a roadmap, this work identifies the current possible\nimplementation and future work. This work does not provide an implemented\nsystem but envisions to inspire the researchers working on the direction in the\nroadmap. We implement the SMSL and D-SFO paradigm that serve as the starting\npoint of the roadmap.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods, however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence, which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.",

We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness, Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency. AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured by traditional $\\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\\%$ recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\\%$, and retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above $80\\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent resilience in realistic enterprise settings.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.",

To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques. When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage LLMs.",

We present a sentence-level labeled dataset that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for improving safety oversight on reasoning.\n  Content Warning: This paper discusses AI safety in the context of harmful prompts and may contain references to potentially harmful content.",

    "abstract": "What does it truly mean for a language model to \"reason\"? Most current evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established philosophical tradition: \\textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics. Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline, which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems.

The latent channel provides a softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.",

Despite these advancements, state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy of diverse reasoning approaches.

We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods, which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent integrators, unlocking the \"best of all worlds\" across tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\\% to 5.4\\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.",

    "abstract": "Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots, particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhances communication in disaster management and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations by ensuring connectivity when infrastructure fails. However, SAR scenarios demand stringent security and low-latency communication, as delays or breaches can compromise mission success. While UAVs serve as mobile relays, they introduce challenges in energy consumption and resource management, necessitating intelligent allocation strategies. Existing UAV-assisted O-RAN approaches often overlook the joint optimization of security, latency, and energy efficiency in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic resource allocation in UAV relays, explicitly addressing these trade-offs. Our approach formulates an optimization problem that integrates security-aware resource allocation, latency minimization, and energy efficiency, which is solved using RL. Unlike heuristic or static methods, our framework adapts in real-time to network dynamics, ensuring robust communication. Simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to heuristic baselines, achieving enhanced security and energy efficiency while maintaining ultra-low latency in SAR scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into various sensitive applications, prompt injection, the use of prompting to induce harmful behaviors from LLMs, poses an ever increasing risk. Prompt injection attacks can cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit harmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a locally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are evaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a \"defense attorney\" model argues the prompt is benign, a \"prosecution attorney\" model argues the prompt is a prompt injection, and a \"judge\" model gives the final classification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct Detector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt injection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the classification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of CourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use of multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks. The implementations of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for Gemma-3-12b-it, Llama-3.3-8B, and Phi-4-mini-instruct are available at https://github.com/isaacwu2000/CourtGuard.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing, resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem, thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in stochastic and safety-critical environments.",

    "abstract": "Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.",

This study examined how six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, we analyzed 60 LLM responses to standardized prompts. Technical skills such as cloud computing and programming appeared consistently, but notable differences emerged in how models addressed non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models varied considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies. Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and a better balance between technical and professional skills, earning top scores in nine of ten countries. Still, all models struggled with cultural sensitivity and infrastructure considerations, averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness. This first broad comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases, creating gaps between technical recommendations and local needs. The strong performance of cost-effective open-source models (Llama: 4.47/5; DeepSeek: 4.25/5) compared to proprietary alternatives (ChatGPT 4: 3.90/5; Claude: 3.46/5) challenges assumptions about AI tool quality in resource-constrained settings. Our findings highlight how computing competency requirements vary widely across Africa and underscore the need for decolonial approaches to AI in education that emphasize contextual relevance",

    "abstract": "Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency, but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.",

    "abstract": "Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2. ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity. ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO. In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and modalities.",

LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks, where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing the representational capacity of the downstream models.

Existing neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23 years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.",

    "abstract": "A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models (conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before - the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3) making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms (A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3) without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from different subjects).",

    "abstract": "The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise, Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree, and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification, all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation time and improving dataset reliability.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline: structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned 7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic monitoring for autonomous systems.",

To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM agents.

Recent approaches model multi-agent systems as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant role. To address this, we propose $\\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the agents.

    "abstract": "Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures. However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory also forms nested subnetworks that support a \"prune-once, deploy-many\" workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss, GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks. Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.",

Yet, this ambition exposes a dual challenge: reasoning jointly over structured, multi-relational schemas and the semantic content of linked unstructured assets. To overcome this, we present DynaQuery - a unified, self-adapting framework that serves as a practical blueprint for next-generation \"Unbound Databases.\" At the heart of DynaQuery lies the Schema Introspection and Linking Engine (SILE), a novel systems primitive that elevates schema linking to a first-class query planning phase. We conduct a rigorous, multi-benchmark empirical evaluation of this structure-aware architecture against the prevalent unstructured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the unstructured retrieval paradigm is architecturally susceptible to catastrophic contextual failures, such as SCHEMA_HALLUCINATION, leading to unreliable query generation. In contrast, our SILE-based design establishes a substantially more robust foundation, nearly eliminating this failure mode. Moreover, end-to-end validation on a complex, newly curated benchmark uncovers a key generalization principle: the transition from pure schema-awareness to holistic semantics-awareness. Taken together, our findings provide a validated architectural basis for developing natural language database interfaces that are robust, adaptable, and predictably consistent.",

Despite claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17 languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking across diverse languages.",

    "abstract": "Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk, where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk). We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25% (1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl). Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments. Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data-structured interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications, argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment across inputs, outputs, and tool calls. Beyond single tasks, there is support for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering. This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible, LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.",

    "abstract": "Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms, which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training. Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model parameter space and better memorization.",

In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.",

    "abstract": "We introduce SoftMimic, a framework for learning compliant whole-body control policies for humanoid robots from example motions. Imitating human motions with reinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but existing methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects deviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when the robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.",

    "abstract": "We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding their use in school environments.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. With the advent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode of interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM capabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to jailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be subtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While single-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency and effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn counterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play framework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning agents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three carefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a systematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family. Evaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve state-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by more than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget. Particularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered highly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and insights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale -- enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as \"black boxes,\" limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.",

In this work, we systematically investigate whether these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term ``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic understanding and reliability of VLMs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we generalize Pearl's do-calculus to an Intuitionistic setting called $j$-stable causal inference inside a topos of sheaves. Our framework is an elaboration of the recently proposed framework of Topos Causal Models (TCMs), where causal interventions are defined as subobjects. We generalize the original setting of TCM using the Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos, defined by a modal operator $j$ on the subobject classifier $Ω$. We introduce $j$-do-calculus, where we replace global truth with local truth defined by Kripke-Joyal semantics, and formalize causal reasoning as structure-preserving morphisms that are stable along $j$-covers. $j$-do-calculus is a sound rule system whose premises and conclusions are formulas of the internal Intuitionistic logic of the causal topos. We define $j$-stability for conditional independences and interventional claims as local truth in the internal logic of the causal topos. We give three inference rules that mirror Pearl's insertion/deletion and action/observation exchange, and we prove soundness in the Kripke-Joyal semantics. A companion paper in preparation will describe how to estimate the required entities from data and instantiate $j$-do with standard discovery procedures (e.g., score-based and constraint-based methods), and will include experimental results on how to (i) form data-driven $j$-covers (via regime/section constructions), (ii) compute chartwise conditional independences after graph surgeries, and (iii) glue them to certify the premises of the $j$-do rules in practice",

    "abstract": "As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC). However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.",

As with any new technology, trust has taken on an important role in this discussion. In this chapter, we examine the multifaceted concept of trust in foundation models, particularly within a geographic context. As reliance on these models increases and they become relied upon for critical decision-making, trust, while essential, has become a fractured concept. Here we categorize trust into three types: epistemic trust in the training data, operational trust in the model's functionality, and interpersonal trust in the model developers. Each type of trust brings with it unique implications for geographic applications. Topics such as cultural context, data heterogeneity, and spatial relationships are fundamental to the spatial sciences and play an important role in developing trust. The chapter continues with a discussion of the challenges posed by different forms of biases, the importance of transparency and explainability, and ethical responsibilities in model development. Finally, the novel perspective of geographic information scientists is emphasized with a call for further transparency, bias mitigation, and regionally-informed policies. Simply put, this chapter aims to provide a conceptual starting point for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand trust in (generative) GeoAI.",

We operationalize belief depth as the extent to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast, Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal, as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world applications.",

We ask whether retrieval diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders; the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.",

However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \\textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \\textit{i.e.}, \\textsc{Title}, \\textsc{Abstract}, \\textsc{Introduction}, and \\textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \\textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \\textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \\textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AcademicEval",

    "abstract": "Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.",

While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17 points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with limited NER training data and compute power.",

In this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning. Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy (78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.",

Despite the developments of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the Sim2Real performance gap.",

Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Jaén is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS. The limited training load and predominance of elective courses restrict the preparation of future physicians to practice in a healthcare environment increasingly mediated by AI.

Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images; however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in prior work.",

    "abstract": "Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On the other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and human feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms (orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize both unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then, we design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted intervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.",

This setup preserves interpretability while enabling targeted search over a large design space. We detail the system architecture and report preliminary results on throughput improvements across multiple models.

We propose ImpForge, an automated red-teaming pipeline that leverages reinforcement learning with tailored reward modules to generate diverse implicit samples across 14 domains. Building on this dataset, we further develop CrossGuard, an intent-aware safeguard providing robust and comprehensive defense against both explicit and implicit threats. Extensive experiments across safe and unsafe benchmarks, implicit and explicit attacks, and multiple out-of-domain settings demonstrate that CrossGuard significantly outperforms existing defenses, including advanced MLLMs and guardrails, achieving stronger security while maintaining high utility.

Additionally, current methods are English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts.

Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc.). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.",

Small \\emph{hinge} gadgets couple adjacent cages that share an element and enforce that a strip swap that removes exactly two adjacencies corresponds bijectively to a block move that removes exactly one decreasing adjacency in the source permutation.

While recent deep learning models have made breakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting low-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to interpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete atomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map interpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned on the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\\% match rate for structures with data limited to 2.0~Å resolution, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000 experimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate. Furthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential for extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure solution in previously intractable cases.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of multimodal data leads to inconsistencies and imbalance, allowing a dominant modality to steer gradient updates. Existing solutions mainly focus on optimization- or data-based strategies but rarely exploit the information inherent in multimodal imbalance or conduct its quantitative analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel quantitative analysis framework for Multimodal Imbalance and design a sample-level adaptive loss function. We define the Modality Gap as the Softmax score difference between modalities for the correct class and model its distribution using a bimodal Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM), representing balanced and imbalanced samples. Using Bayes' theorem, we estimate each sample's posterior probability of belonging to these two groups. Based on this, our adaptive loss (1) minimizes the overall Modality Gap, (2) aligns imbalanced samples with balanced ones, and (3) adaptively penalizes each according to its imbalance degree. A two-stage training strategy-warm-up and adaptive phases,yields state-of-the-art performance on CREMA-D (80.65%), AVE (70.40%), and KineticSound (72.42%). Fine-tuning with high-quality samples identified by the GMM further improves results, highlighting their value for effective multimodal fusion.",

Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and principled uncertainty quantification of BO.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish between fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections. To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs.",

In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration method, called \\textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism, and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when adapting to new knowledge.",

On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal.

CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios.

However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.",

This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.",

We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.

    "abstract": "Unlike other military technologies driven by national security needs and developed with federal funding, AI is predominantly funded and advanced by commercial industry for civilian applications. However, there is a lack of understanding of the reasons commercial AI firms decide to work with the DoD or choose to abstain from the defence market. This thesis argues that the contract law and procurement framework are among the most significant obstacles. This research indicates that the commercial AI industry actually views the DoD as an attractive customer. However, this attraction is despite the obstacles presented by traditional contract law and procurement practices used to solicit and award contracts. Drawing on social exchange theory, this thesis introduces a theoretical framework, optimal buyer theory, to understand the factors that influence a commercial decision to engage with the DoD. Interviews from a sample of the participants explain why the AI industry holds such perceptions, opinions, and preferences about contracts generally and the DoD, specifically, in its role as a customer. This thesis concludes that commercial AI firms are attracted to contracts that are consistent with their business and technology considerations. Additionally, it develops best practices for leveraging existing contract law, primarily other transaction authority, to align contracting practices with commercial preferences and the machine learning development and deployment lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Machine Learning (ML) models across multiple clients while preserving their privacy. Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.",

Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker, we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45, nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56, nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond clinical order selection.",

We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII (EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We investigate this \"peaceful coexistence,\" hypothesizing that the model uses independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.\n  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a \"reverse O-tag representation drift.\" The model, initially trained to map PII patterns to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and \"release\" these patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation, highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag plasticity.

    "abstract": "Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks. Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the \"Maritime Continent barrier\", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation > 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent, computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.",

Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points.

To train a robust model for multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates, while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.",

We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.",

    "abstract": "In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems, constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $λ$, which governs the trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $λ$-profiles that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly sensitive nature of $λ$ and moreover confirm the lack of general intuition for choosing the optimal value $λ^*$. Our findings additionally show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even exceed the optimal performance found at $λ^*$ due to the vast difference in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning.

Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However, existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module, which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even when trained on limited and noisy data.",

These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.",

    "abstract": "Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit. Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the trainability of various sparse network architectures.",

    "abstract": "We propose a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled, and prompt-driven zero-shot video summarization framework that bridges large language models with structured semantic reasoning. A small subset of human annotations is converted into high-confidence pseudo labels and organized into dataset-adaptive rubrics defining clear evaluation dimensions such as thematic relevance, action detail, and narrative progression. During inference, boundary scenes, including the opening and closing segments, are scored independently based on their own descriptions, while intermediate scenes incorporate concise summaries of adjacent segments to assess narrative continuity and redundancy. This design enables the language model to balance local salience with global coherence without any parameter tuning. Across three benchmarks, the proposed method achieves stable and competitive results, with F1 scores of 57.58 on SumMe, 63.05 on TVSum, and 53.79 on QFVS, surpassing zero-shot baselines by +0.85, +0.84, and +0.37, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling combined with contextual prompting effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable, and training-free paradigm for both generic and query-focused video summarization.",

However, most existing occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place classification\" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic and continuous nature of real scenarios. In this paper, we propose SparseWorld, a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient, powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency.",

We address two core challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition, a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level, fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\\% and 79.78\\% for cross-subject, and 95.12\\% and 83.15\\% for cross-session protocols. On the large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\\% (cross-subject). Extensive ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.",

    "abstract": "Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios. Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular, interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth. However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust generalization of our framework.",

We then prove that the problem admits a $1$-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We design a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\rm{tw}\\cdot \\log \\rm{tw})}\\cdot |V|$-time algorithm for any graph $G=(V,E)$ of treewidth $\\rm{tw}$ (which, for a set system, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). This is in contrast with closely related problems that require a double-exponential dependency on the treewidth (assuming the ETH).",

To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and \"negative\" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.",

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.",

We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention: interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially, this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment. Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding models that are more capable and more reliable.",

While existing TSFMs demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority of HIBA.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this limitation, we introduce $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems. $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models directly into the search process, $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ generates more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic, non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.",

In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.",

Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies.

Meanwhile, sub-symbolic AI, particularly machine learning, offers alternative paradigms for learning from data, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (RL). This paper investigates the use of Q-learning, a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, for the passive inference of deterministic finite automata. It builds on the core insight that the learned Q-function, which maps state-action pairs to rewards, can be reinterpreted as the transition function of a DFA over a finite domain. This provides a novel bridge between sub-symbolic learning and symbolic representations. The paper demonstrates how Q-learning can be adapted for automaton inference and provides an evaluation on several examples.",

    "abstract": "Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).",

While prior work has explored learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed. In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent coordination problems.",

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of Optimal Power Flow in smart grids.

This means obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by the original environment.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment  criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained, within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.",

Existing alignment approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and 6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy, while incurring negligible inference overhead.",

However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.",

Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability.

    "abstract": "Acoustic scene classification (ASC) suffers from device-induced domain shift, especially when labels are limited. Prior work focuses on curriculum-based training schedules that structure data presentation by ordering or reweighting training examples from easy-to-hard to facilitate learning; however, existing curricula are static, fixing the ordering or the weights before training and ignoring that example difficulty and marginal utility evolve with the learned representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum (DDSC), a training schedule that adapts the curriculum online by combining two signals computed each epoch: a domain-invariance signal and a learning-progress signal. A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into per-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs and progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead. Under the official DCASE 2024 Task~1 protocol, DDSC consistently improves cross-device performance across diverse ASC baselines and label budgets, with the largest gains on unseen-device splits.",

    "abstract": "License plate image restoration is important not only as a preprocessing step for license plate recognition but also for enhancing evidential value, improving visual clarity, and enabling broader reuse of license plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff-LP, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff-LP leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff-LP incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff-LP significantly outperformed baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28.3% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) on the Roboflow-LP dataset compared with the best-performing baseline.",

While recent rubric-based approaches offer transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization, creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption: \\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality, query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided \\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an \\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an interpretable, hierarchical \"Theme-Tips\" rubric set. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance. Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\\% of the source data), our method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized, fully-trained counterparts.

    "abstract": "As the demand for human-like reasoning, multi-turn dialogues, and long-form responses grows, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to support efficient and effective long-sequence decoding. However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.\n  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\\times$ speedups. Furthermore, the insights of DynaKV naturally extend to other long-context workloads and multi-tier memory hierarchies, underscoring its broader applicability.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal data captures complex dynamics across both space and time, yet traditional visualizations are complex, require domain expertise and often fail to resonate with broader audiences. Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.",

Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.",

Retrieval-augmented methods mitigate this by injecting repository context at inference time. The low inference-time latency budget affects either retrieval quality or the added latency adversely impacts user experience. We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against baselines. Experiments show that SpecAgent consistently achieves absolute gains of 9-11% (48-58% relative) compared to the best-performing baselines, while significantly reducing inference latency.",

The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.

However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.",

The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment, and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.",

    "abstract": "Throughout application domains, we now rely extensively on algorithmic systems to engage with ever-expanding datasets of information. Despite their benefits, these systems are often complex (comprising of many intricate tools, e.g., moderation, recommender systems, prediction models), of unknown structure (due to the lack of accompanying documentation), and having hard-to-predict yet potentially severe downstream consequences (due to the extensive use, systematic enactment of existing errors, and many comprising feedback loops). As such, understanding and evaluating these systems as a whole remains a challenge for both researchers and legislators. To aid ongoing efforts, we introduce a formal framework for such visibility allocation systems (VASs) which we define as (semi-)automated systems deciding which (processed) data to present a human user with. We review typical tools comprising VASs and define the associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be decomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover, we survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding system diagnostics. Using forecasting-based recommendations in school choice as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can support VAS evaluation. We also discuss how our framework can support ongoing AI-legislative efforts to locate obligations, quantify systemic risks, and enable adaptive compliance.",

Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition: categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and cost.

    "abstract": "The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions. Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework. Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools. Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto platforms (4.62/5).",

    "abstract": "Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal continual learning, aiming to learn new tasks sequentially in multi-modal settings while preserving performance on previously learned ones. However, existing methods mainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality entanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to continuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive analysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic drift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks; 2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be confused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework is designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic drift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select samples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence confusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed, allowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable classes during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual incremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms single-modal continual learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval (SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings. Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically, on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP, 2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3.

LLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning demonstrate strong performance in challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, even with relatively small model sizes. However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks, in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal). We validate CLAWS on 4545 math problems collected from 181 math contests (AJHSME, AMC, AIME).",

Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.",

Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2 diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event samples and patient heterogeneity (\\eg different progression rates and pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework. TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.",

Motivated by human and animal learning where embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or logical bugs) by 48\\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\\%. Local experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and pruning mitigates inefficiency. This framework extends RL from human feedback (RLHF) for more emotionally aware code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.",

This paper reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy, especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.

    "abstract": "The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now, been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset - a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially, this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.",

While many methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context. Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and inference latency.",

    "abstract": "Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.",

In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD) between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset \\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM \\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale, systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection methods in plankton recognition.

    "abstract": "Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram (ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features , which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC 0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that model-identified key features, such as \"premature ventricular complexes\" (risk predictor) and \"normal sinus rhythm\" (protective factor), were highly consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.",

However, the inclusion of extensive contextual information, including system prompts, MCP tool definitions, and context histories, in MCP-enabled LLM interactions, dramatically inflates token usage. Given that LLM providers charge based on tokens, these expanded contexts can quickly escalate monetary costs and increase the computational load on LLM services. This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based analysis of MCP-enabled interactions with LLMs, revealing trade-offs between capability, performance, and cost. We explore how different LLM models and MCP configurations impact key performance metrics such as token efficiency, monetary cost, task completion times, and task success rates, and suggest potential optimizations, including enabling parallel tool calls and implementing robust task abort mechanisms.

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;",

However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective: simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity, geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.",

On ProtocolBench, protocol choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery, resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario (or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA. We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and improve reliability at scale.",

Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective, inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics, histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved 77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached 97.49% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 20.19%. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical applications in food quality monitoring.",

In this study, we develop a cancer biology-informed neural network model(CBINN) to infer the unknown parameters in the system of equations as well as to discover the missing physics from sparse and noisy measurements. We test the performance of the CBINN model on three distinct nonlinear compartmental tumor-immune models and evaluate its robustness across multiple synthetic noise levels. By harnessing these highly nonlinear dynamics, our CBINN framework effectively estimates the unknown model parameters and uncovers the underlying physical laws or mathematical structures that govern these biological systems, even from scattered and noisy measurements.

In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation?\n  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.",

However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.",

We propose a novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration (MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided, modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively. The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings, and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and composite loss.

This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance (VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Smart contracts play a significant role in automating blockchain services. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose serious threats to blockchain security. Currently, traditional detection methods primarily rely on static analysis and formal verification, which can result in high false-positive rates and poor scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently made significant progress in smart contract vulnerability detection. However, they still face challenges such as high inference costs and substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a parallel LLM and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first develop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for LLM fine-tuning. SLoRA introduces sparsification by incorporating a sparse matrix into quantized LoRA-based LLMs, thereby reducing computational overhead and resource requirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related issues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval with Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by the LLM. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of the RAG system and the LLM, thereby generating the final detection results. After completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to guide LLMs to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms of F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for multi-label detection.",

However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning, coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation, output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies, and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions (VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or annotations.",

Two systems were developed and compared: a Single-Agent System (SAS), in which one LLM agent infers favorable and adverse repayment signals, and a Popperian Multi-agent Debate System (PMADS), which structures the dual-perspective analysis as adversarial argumentation under the Karl Popper Debate protocol. Evaluation addressed three fronts: (i) work productivity compared with human experts; (ii) perceived report quality and usability, rated by credit risk professionals for system-generated reports; and (iii) reasoning characteristics quantified via reasoning-tree analysis. Both systems drastically reduced task completion time relative to human experts. Professionals rated SAS reports as adequate, while PMADS reports exceeded neutral benchmarks and scored significantly higher in explanatory adequacy, practical applicability, and usability. Reasoning-tree analysis showed PMADS produced deeper, more elaborated structures, whereas SAS yielded single-layered trees. These findings suggest that structured multi-agent debate enhances analytical rigor and perceived usefulness, though at the cost of longer computation time. Overall, the results demonstrate that reasoning-centered automation represents a promising approach for developing useful AI systems in decision-critical financial contexts.",

    "abstract": "The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs) are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training, involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism. In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.",

This paper introduces Malicious Token Injection (MTI), a modular framework that systematically perturbs cached key vectors at selected layers and timesteps through controlled magnitude and frequency, using additive Gaussian noise, zeroing, and orthogonal rotations. A theoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through attention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and softmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly alters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2 and LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic reasoning pipelines. These findings identify cache integrity as a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in current LLM deployments, positioning cache corruption as a reproducible and theoretically grounded threat model for future robustness and security research.",

    "abstract": "Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks. Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation and unlearning performance.",

We evaluate generation throughput, memory usage, and power consumption under varying CPU configurations, using multiple prompt types to simulate realistic workloads. Our results show that SBCs can reliably support models up to 1.5B parameters, with Llamafile achieving up to 4x higher throughput and 30-40% lower power usage than Ollama. We identify architecture-specific bottlenecks, highlight runtime-level trade-offs, and provide practical deployment recommendations.

    "abstract": "Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.\n  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions. Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied post-hoc.\n  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48 (66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism identification without labeled supervision.",

Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.

Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns.

    ],
    "abstract": "The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.",

    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.",

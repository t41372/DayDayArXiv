Linking intraoperative\ndata with postoperative outcomes is a promising and low-cost way of evaluating\nlong-term impacts of surgical interventions. In this study, we evaluated how\npreoperative cognitive status as measured by the clock drawing test contributed\nto predicting length of hospital stay, hospital charges, average pain\nexperienced during follow-up, and 1-year mortality over and above\nintraoperative variables, demographics, preoperative physical status and\ncomorbidities.

Different machine learning models were trained to\nclassify postoperative outcomes in hold-out test sets. The models were compared\nto their relative performance, time complexity, and interpretability. Shapley\nAdditive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was used to find the most predictive\nfeatures for classifying different outcomes in different surgical contexts.\nRelative classification performances achieved by different feature sets showed\nthat the perioperative cognitive dataset which included clock drawing features\nin addition to intraoperative variables, demographics, and comorbidities served\nas the best dataset for 12 of 18 possible surgery-outcome combinations...",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has led to tremendous success in many real-world applications\nof computer vision, thanks to sophisticated architectures such as Convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to\ncrafted adversarial perturbations in inputs. These inputs appear almost\nindistinguishable from natural images, yet they are incorrectly classified by\nCNN architectures. This vulnerability of adversarial examples has led\nresearchers to focus on enhancing the robustness of deep learning models in\ngeneral, and CNNs in particular, by creating defense and detection methods to\ndistinguish adversarials inputs from natural ones. In this paper, we address\nthe adversarial robustness of CNNs through causal reasoning.\n  We propose CausAdv: a causal framework for detecting adversarial examples\nbased on counterfactual reasoning. CausAdv learns causal and non-causal\nfeatures of every input, and quantifies the counterfactual information (CI) of\nevery filter of the last convolutional layer. Then we perform statistical\nanalysis on the filters CI of every sample, whether clan or adversarials, to\ndemonstrate how adversarial examples indeed exhibit different CI distributions\ncompared to clean samples. Our results show that causal reasoning enhances the\nprocess of adversarials detection without the need to train a separate\ndetector. In addition, we illustrate the efficiency of causal explanations as a\nhelpful detection technique through visualizing the causal features.

Current analysis approaches focus\non individual components of an AI system, like training data or models, in\nisolation, overlooking hazards from component interactions or how they are\nsituated within a company's development process. To this end, we draw from the\nestablished field of system safety, which considers safety as an emergent\nproperty of the entire system, not just its components. In this work, we\ntranslate System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) - a recognized system safety\nframework - for analyzing AI operation and development processes. We focus on\nsystems that rely on machine learning algorithms and conducted STPA on three\ncase studies involving linear regression, reinforcement learning, and\ntransformer-based generative models. Our analysis explored how STPA's control\nand system-theoretic perspectives apply to AI systems and whether unique AI\ntraits - such as model opacity, capability uncertainty, and output complexity -\nnecessitate significant modifications to the framework. We find that the key\nconcepts and steps of conducting an STPA readily apply, albeit with a few\nadaptations tailored for AI systems. We present the Process-oriented Hazard\nAnalysis for AI Systems (PHASE) as a guideline that adapts STPA concepts for\nAI, making STPA-based hazard analysis more accessible. PHASE enables four key\naffordances for analysts responsible for managing AI system harms: 1) detection\nof hazards at the systems level, including those from accumulation of disparate\nissues; 2) explicit acknowledgment of social factors contributing to\nexperiences of algorithmic harms; 3) creation of traceable accountability\nchains between harms and those who can mitigate the harm; and 4) ongoing\nmonitoring and mitigation of new hazards.",

Most approaches for bias mitigation focus on\neither post-hoc analysis or data augmentation. However, these are transient\nsolutions, without addressing the root cause: the model itself. Numerous prior\nworks show the influence of the attention module towards steering generations.\nWe believe that analyzing attention is also crucial for understanding bias, as\nit provides insight into how the LLM distributes its focus across different\nentities and how this contributes to biased decisions. To this end, we first\nintroduce a metric to quantify the LLM's preference for one entity over\nanother. We then propose $\\texttt{ATLAS}$ (Attention-based Targeted Layer\nAnalysis and Scaling), a technique to localize bias to specific layers of the\nLLM by analyzing attention scores and then reduce bias by scaling attention in\nthese biased layers. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments across 3\ndatasets (BBQ, Crows-Pairs, and WinoGender) using $\\texttt{GPT-2 XL}$ (1.5B),\n$\\texttt{GPT-J}$ (6B), $\\texttt{LLaMA-2}$ (7B) and $\\texttt{LLaMA-3}$ (8B). Our\nexperiments demonstrate that bias is concentrated in the later layers,\ntypically around the last third. We also show how $\\texttt{ATLAS}$ effectively\nmitigates bias through targeted interventions without compromising downstream\nperformance and an average increase of only 0.82% in perplexity when the\nintervention is applied.

A model adept at reasoning is\nexpected to demonstrate proficiency in both data retrieval and the structural\nunderstanding of charts, suggesting a synergy between these competencies.\nHowever, in our zero-shot study using the sophisticated MATCHA model on a\nscientific chart question answering dataset, an intriguing pattern emerged. The\nmodel showcased superior performance in chart reasoning (27\\%) over chart\nstructure (19\\%) and data retrieval (14\\%). This performance gap suggests that\nmodels might more readily generalize reasoning capabilities across datasets,\nbenefiting from consistent mathematical and linguistic semantics, even when\nchallenged by changes in the visual domain that complicate structure\ncomprehension and data retrieval. Furthermore, the efficacy of using accuracy\nof binary QA for evaluating chart reasoning comes into question if models can\ndeduce correct answers without parsing chart data or structure. VPP highlights\nthe importance of integrating reasoning with visual comprehension to enhance\nmodel performance in chart analysis, pushing for a balanced approach in\nevaluating visual data interpretation capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The era of large language models (LLM) raises questions not only about how to\ntrain models, but also about how to evaluate them. Despite numerous existing\nbenchmarks, insufficient attention is often given to creating assessments that\ntest LLMs in a valid and reliable manner. To address this challenge, we\naccommodate the Evidence-centered design (ECD) methodology and propose a\ncomprehensive approach to benchmark development based on rigorous psychometric\nprinciples. In this paper, we have made the first attempt to illustrate this\napproach by creating a new benchmark in the field of pedagogy and education,\nhighlighting the limitations of existing benchmark development approach and\ntaking into account the development of LLMs. We conclude that a new approach to\nbenchmarking is required to match the growing complexity of AI applications in\nthe educational context. We construct a novel benchmark guided by the Bloom's\ntaxonomy and rigorously designed by a consortium of education experts trained\nin test development. Thus the current benchmark provides an academically robust\nand practical assessment tool tailored for LLMs, rather than human\nparticipants. Tested empirically on the GPT model in the Russian language, it\nevaluates model performance across varied task complexities, revealing critical\ngaps in current LLM capabilities. Our results indicate that while generative AI\ntools hold significant promise for education - potentially supporting tasks\nsuch as personalized tutoring, real-time feedback, and multilingual learning -\ntheir reliability as autonomous teachers' assistants right now remain rather\nlimited, particularly in tasks requiring deeper cognitive engagement.",

This paper presents three primary\ncontributions to advance this field:\n  - Advanced Agentic Framework: A system that handles multi-hop queries,\ngenerates and executes task graphs, selects appropriate tools, and adapts to\nreal-time changes.\n  - Novel Evaluation Metrics: Introduction of Node F1 Score, Structural\nSimilarity Index (SSI), and Tool F1 Score to comprehensively assess agentic\nsystems.\n  - Specialized Dataset: Development of an AsyncHow-based dataset for analyzing\nagent behavior across different task complexities.\n  Our findings reveal that asynchronous and dynamic task graph decomposition\nsignificantly enhances system responsiveness and scalability, particularly for\ncomplex, multi-step tasks.

Our benchmark 1) captures\nreal-world use cases, 2) is fully automatic and does not require human\njudgment, and 3) is based on a renewable stream of fresh data. In Image2Struct,\nVLMs are prompted to generate the underlying structure (e.g., LaTeX code or\nHTML) from an input image (e.g., webpage screenshot). The structure is then\nrendered to produce an output image (e.g., rendered webpage), which is compared\nagainst the input image to produce a similarity score. This round-trip\nevaluation allows us to quantitatively evaluate VLMs on tasks with multiple\nvalid structures. We create a pipeline that downloads fresh data from active\nonline communities upon execution and evaluates the VLMs without human\nintervention. We introduce three domains (Webpages, LaTeX, and Musical Scores)\nand use five image metrics (pixel similarity, cosine similarity between the\nInception vectors, learned perceptual image patch similarity, structural\nsimilarity index measure, and earth mover similarity) that allow efficient and\nautomatic comparison between pairs of images. We evaluate Image2Struct on 14\nprominent VLMs and find that scores vary widely, indicating that Image2Struct\ncan differentiate between the performances of different VLMs. Additionally, the\nbest score varies considerably across domains (e.g., 0.402 on sheet music vs.\n0.830 on LaTeX equations), indicating that Image2Struct contains tasks of\nvarying difficulty.

The resulting model performances show significant\nimprovement on video data with these frame interjections over the same model\nwithout the algorithmic addition.

Due to the lack of large-scale in-domain robotic datasets,\nprior works utilize in-the-wild human videos to pre-train robotic visual\nrepresentation. Despite their promising results, representations from human\nvideos are inevitably subject to distribution shifts and lack the dynamics\ninformation crucial for task completion. We first evaluate various pre-trained\nrepresentations in terms of their correlation to the downstream robotic\nmanipulation tasks (i.e., manipulation centricity). Interestingly, we find that\nthe \"manipulation centricity\" is a strong indicator of success rates when\napplied to downstream tasks. Drawing from these findings, we propose\nManipulation Centric Representation (MCR), a foundation representation learning\nframework capturing both visual features and the dynamics information such as\nactions and proprioceptions of manipulation tasks to improve manipulation\ncentricity. Specifically, we pre-train a visual encoder on the DROID robotic\ndataset and leverage motion-relevant data such as robot proprioceptive states\nand actions. We introduce a novel contrastive loss that aligns visual\nobservations with the robot's proprioceptive state-action dynamics, combined\nwith a behavior cloning (BC)-like actor loss to predict actions during\npre-training, along with a time contrastive loss. Empirical results across 4\nsimulation domains with 20 tasks verify that MCR outperforms the strongest\nbaseline method by 14.8%.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) towards large action models trained offline on large-scale\ndatasets via sequence modeling. Existing models are primarily based on the\nTransformer architecture, which result in powerful agents. However, due to slow\ninference times, Transformer-based approaches are impractical for real-time\napplications, such as robotics. Recently, modern recurrent architectures, such\nas xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed that exhibit parallelization benefits\nduring training similar to the Transformer architecture while offering fast\ninference. In this work, we study the aptitude of these modern recurrent\narchitectures for large action models. Consequently, we propose a Large\nRecurrent Action Model (LRAM) with an xLSTM at its core that comes with\nlinear-time inference complexity and natural sequence length extrapolation\nabilities. Experiments on 432 tasks from 6 domains show that LRAM compares\nfavorably to Transformers in terms of performance and speed.",

    "abstract": "Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\nremarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation,\nleading to widespread adoption across various domains. However, their\nincreasing model sizes render local deployment impractical for individual\nusers, pushing many to rely on computing service providers for inference\nthrough a blackbox API. This reliance introduces a new risk: a computing\nprovider may stealthily substitute the requested LLM with a smaller, less\ncapable model without consent from users, thereby delivering inferior outputs\nwhile benefiting from cost savings. In this paper, we formalize the problem of\nverifiable inference for LLMs. Existing verifiable computing solutions based on\ncryptographic or game-theoretic techniques are either computationally\nuneconomical or rest on strong assumptions. We introduce SVIP, a secret-based\nverifiable LLM inference protocol that leverages intermediate outputs from LLM\nas unique model identifiers. By training a proxy task on these outputs and\nrequiring the computing provider to return both the generated text and the\nprocessed intermediate outputs, users can reliably verify whether the computing\nprovider is acting honestly. In addition, the integration of a secret mechanism\nfurther enhances the security of our protocol. We thoroughly analyze our\nprotocol under multiple strong and adaptive adversarial scenarios. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that SVIP is accurate, generalizable,\ncomputationally efficient, and resistant to various attacks. Notably, SVIP\nachieves false negative rates below 5% and false positive rates below 3%, while\nrequiring less than 0.01 seconds per query for verification.",

Our key contribution is the\nintroduction of One-shot Private Aggregation ($\\mathsf{OPA}$) where clients\nspeak only once (or even choose not to speak) per aggregation evaluation. Since\neach client communicates only once per aggregation, this simplifies managing\ndropouts and dynamic participation, contrasting with multi-round protocols and\naligning with plaintext secure aggregation, where clients interact only once.\nWe construct $\\mathsf{OPA}$ based on LWR, LWE, class groups, DCR and\ndemonstrate applications to privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) where\nclients \\emph{speak once}.

In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning\nrobustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different\nvariants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or\nfunction graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed\nto assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only\nstatic sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning\nrobustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math\nbenchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501\nhigh-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program.\nThose programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic\ngeneration of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different\ntypes of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the\ngeneralization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying\ninput conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010\ngenerated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model\naccuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all\n10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy.

Our main model is based on the\naudio-visual (AV) Conformer, which processes video and audio embeddings\nextracted with ResNet50 and with an audio encoder pre-trained on SELD,\nrespectively. This model outperformed the audio-visual baseline of the\ndevelopment set of the STARSS23 dataset by a wide margin, halving its DOAE and\nimproving the F1 by more than 3x.

While the new system improved the RDE of our\nprevious model by about 3 percentage points, it achieved a lower F1 score. This\nmay be caused by sound classes that rarely appear in the training set and that\nthe more complex system does not detect, as analysis can determine.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is pivotal in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic\naccuracy, informing treatment strategies, and tracking disease progression.\nThis process allows clinicians to extract critical information from visual\ndata, enabling personalized patient care. However, developing neural networks\nfor segmentation remains challenging, especially when preserving image\nresolution, which is essential in detecting subtle details that influence\ndiagnoses. Moreover, the lack of transparency in these deep learning models has\nslowed their adoption in clinical practice. Efforts in model interpretability\nare increasingly focused on making these models' decision-making processes more\ntransparent. In this paper, we introduce MAPUNetR, a novel architecture that\nsynergizes the strengths of transformer models with the proven U-Net framework\nfor medical image segmentation. Our model addresses the resolution preservation\nchallenge and incorporates attention maps highlighting segmented regions,\nincreasing accuracy and interpretability. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset,\nMAPUNetR achieved a dice score of 0.88 and a dice coefficient of 0.92 on the\nISIC 2018 dataset. Our experiments show that the model maintains stable\nperformance and potential as a powerful tool for medical image segmentation in\nclinical practice.",

    "abstract": "In open-world environments like Minecraft, existing agents face challenges in\ncontinuously learning structured knowledge, particularly causality. These\nchallenges stem from the opacity inherent in black-box models and an excessive\nreliance on prior knowledge during training, which impair their\ninterpretability and generalization capability. To this end, we introduce ADAM,\nAn emboDied causal Agent in Minecraft, that can autonomously navigate the open\nworld, perceive multimodal contexts, learn causal world knowledge, and tackle\ncomplex tasks through lifelong learning. ADAM is empowered by four key\ncomponents: 1) an interaction module, enabling the agent to execute actions\nwhile documenting the interaction processes; 2) a causal model module, tasked\nwith constructing an ever-growing causal graph from scratch, which enhances\ninterpretability and diminishes reliance on prior knowledge; 3) a controller\nmodule, comprising a planner, an actor, and a memory pool, which uses the\nlearned causal graph to accomplish tasks; 4) a perception module, powered by\nmultimodal large language models, which enables ADAM to perceive like a human\nplayer. Extensive experiments show that ADAM constructs an almost perfect\ncausal graph from scratch, enabling efficient task decomposition and execution\nwith strong interpretability. Notably, in our modified Minecraft games where no\nprior knowledge is available, ADAM maintains its performance and shows\nremarkable robustness and generalization capability. ADAM pioneers a novel\nparadigm that integrates causal methods and embodied agents in a synergistic\nmanner. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/ADAM.",

This review addresses gaps in the existing\nliterature by providing a broader perspective than previous studies focused on\nspecific cancer types or applications. Methods: A comprehensive literature\nsearch was conducted using the Scopus database, identifying 94 relevant studies\npublished between 2019 and 2024. Data extraction included study\ncharacteristics, cancer types, NLP methodologies, dataset information,\nperformance metrics, challenges, and future directions. Studies were\ncategorized based on cancer types and NLP applications. Results: The results\nshowed a growing trend in NLP applications for cancer research, with breast,\nlung, and colorectal cancers being the most studied. Information extraction and\ntext classification emerged as predominant NLP tasks. A shift from rule-based\nto advanced machine learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models,\nwas observed. The Dataset sizes used in existing studies varied widely. Key\nchallenges included the limited generalizability of proposed solutions and the\nneed for improved integration into clinical workflows. Conclusion: NLP\ntechniques show significant potential in analyzing EHRs and clinical notes for\ncancer research. However, future work should focus on improving model\ngeneralizability, enhancing robustness in handling complex clinical language,\nand expanding applications to understudied cancer types. Integration of NLP\ntools into clinical practice and addressing ethical considerations remain\ncrucial for utilizing the full potential of NLP in enhancing cancer diagnosis,\ntreatment, and patient outcomes.",

However, due to their immense size, performing inference\nwith LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has\nproposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization,\npruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost\nand latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive\nperformance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another\ncritical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due\nto inference acceleration optimizations.

    "abstract": "We develop a generic policy gradient method with the global optimality\nguarantee for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While policy gradient\nmethods are widely used for solving dynamic decision problems due to their\nscalable and efficient nature, adapting these methods to account for model\nambiguity has been challenging, often making it impractical to learn robust\npolicies. This paper introduces a novel policy gradient method, Double-Loop\nRobust Policy Mirror Descent (DRPMD), for solving robust MDPs. DRPMD employs a\ngeneral mirror descent update rule for the policy optimization with adaptive\ntolerance per iteration, guaranteeing convergence to a globally optimal policy.\nWe provide a comprehensive analysis of DRPMD, including new convergence results\nunder both direct and softmax parameterizations, and provide novel insights\ninto the inner problem solution through Transition Mirror Ascent (TMA).\nAdditionally, we propose innovative parametric transition kernels for both\ndiscrete and continuous state-action spaces, broadening the applicability of\nour approach. Empirical results validate the robustness and global convergence\nof DRPMD across various challenging robust MDP settings.",

However, a comprehensive evaluation of semantic\nsegmentation models (SSM) using these datasets is lacking. To address this gap,\nwe evaluated the available annotated HSI datasets on four deep learning-based\nbaseline SSMs: DeepLab v3+, HRNet, PSPNet, and U-Net, along with its two\nvariants: Coordinate Attention (UNet-CA) and Convolutional Block-Attention\nModule (UNet-CBAM).

Our results indicate\nthat UNet-CBAM, which extracts channel-wise features, outperforms other SSMs\nand shows potential to leverage spectral information for enhanced semantic\nsegmentation. This study establishes a baseline SSM benchmark on available\nannotated datasets for future evaluation of HSI-based ADAS perception.

Recently, machine learning has been increasingly utilized\nto solve PDE problems, but they often encounter challenges related to\ninterpretability, generalizability, and strong dependency on rich labeled data.\nHence, we introduce a new PDE-Preserved Coarse Correction Network\n(P$^2$C$^2$Net) to efficiently solve spatiotemporal PDE problems on coarse mesh\ngrids in small data regimes. The model consists of two synergistic modules: (1)\na trainable PDE block that learns to update the coarse solution (i.e., the\nsystem state), based on a high-order numerical scheme with boundary condition\nencoding, and (2) a neural network block that consistently corrects the\nsolution on the fly. In particular, we propose a learnable symmetric Conv\nfilter, with weights shared over the entire model, to accurately estimate the\nspatial derivatives of PDE based on the neural-corrected system state. The\nresulting physics-encoded model is capable of handling limited training data\n(e.g., 3--5 trajectories) and accelerates the prediction of PDE solutions on\ncoarse spatiotemporal grids while maintaining a high accuracy. P$^2$C$^2$Net\nachieves consistent state-of-the-art performance with over 50\\% gain (e.g., in\nterms of relative prediction error) across four datasets covering complex\nreaction-diffusion processes and turbulent flows.",

We present a framework for assessing the auditability of AI-integrating\nsystems that consists of three parts: (1) Verifiable claims about the validity,\nutility and ethics of the system, (2) Evidence on subjects (data, models or the\nsystem) in different types (documentation, raw sources and logs) to back or\nrefute claims, (3) Evidence must be accessible to auditors via technical means\n(APIs, monitoring tools, explainable AI, etc.). We apply the framework to\nassess the auditability of Moodle's dropout prediction system and a prototype\nAI-based LA. We find that Moodle's auditability is limited by incomplete\ndocumentation, insufficient monitoring capabilities and a lack of available\ntest data. The framework supports assessing the auditability of AI-based LA\nsystems in use and improves the design of auditable systems and thus of audits.",

Noise reduction is crucial for maintaining image quality,\nespecially given such challenges as motion artifacts and the limited\navailability of clean data in medical imaging. To address these issues, we\npropose an unsupervised training framework for dynamic context-aware denoising\nof fluoroscopy image sequences. First, we train the multi-scale recurrent\nattention U-Net (MSR2AU-Net) without requiring clean data to address the\ninitial noise. Second, we incorporate a knowledge distillation-based\nuncorrelated noise suppression module and a recursive filtering-based\ncorrelated noise suppression module enhanced with motion compensation to\nfurther improve motion compensation and achieve superior denoising performance.\nFinally, we introduce a novel approach by combining these modules with a\npixel-wise dynamic object motion cross-fusion matrix, designed to adapt to\nmotion, and an edge-preserving loss for precise detail retention. To validate\nthe proposed method, we conducted extensive numerical experiments on medical\nimage datasets, including 3500 fluoroscopy images from dynamic phantoms (2,400\nimages for training, 1,100 for testing) and 350 clinical images from a spinal\nsurgery patient.

Despite the success of this approach in\nexplaining various psychological phenomena such as order, conjunction,\ndisjunction, and response replicability effects there remains a potential\ndissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological\nprocesses in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach. In\nthis paper, we develop a quantum-like representation of networks of\ncommunicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum\ntheory but on generalized probability theory (GPT), with a focus on the\noperational measurement framework. Specifically, we use a version of GPT that\nrelies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex\nHilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted\ndirected graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these\nweight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect\nobservables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments a\ncritical aspect of this model. This GPT based approach successfully reproduces\nkey quantum-like effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction\neffects (commonly associated with decision interference).

Moreover, existing works often\nonly consider the positive excitation of a user's historical interactions on\nhis/her next choice on candidate items while ignoring the commonly existing\nnegative excitation, resulting in insufficient modeling dynamic interest.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promising results in\nsequential recommendation (SR). Existing approaches predominantly rely on\nimplicit conditional diffusion models, which compress user behaviors into a\nsingle representation during the forward diffusion process. While effective to\nsome extent, this oversimplification often leads to the loss of sequential and\ncontextual information, which is critical for understanding user behavior.\nMoreover, explicit information, such as user-item interactions or sequential\npatterns, remains underutilized, despite its potential to directly guide the\nrecommendation process and improve precision. However, combining implicit and\nexplicit information is non-trivial, as it requires dynamically integrating\nthese complementary signals while avoiding noise and irrelevant patterns within\nuser behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Conditional\nDiffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation (DCRec), which effectively\nintegrates implicit and explicit information by embedding dual conditions into\nboth the forward and reverse diffusion processes. This allows the model to\nretain valuable sequential and contextual information while leveraging explicit\nuser-item interactions to guide the recommendation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce the Dual Conditional Diffusion Transformer (DCDT), which employs a\ncross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate explicit signals throughout\nthe diffusion stages, ensuring contextual understanding and minimizing the\ninfluence of irrelevant patterns. This design enables precise and contextually\nrelevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that DCRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth accuracy and computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly-based cyber threat detection using deep learning is on a constant\ngrowth in popularity for novel cyber-attack detection and forensics. A robust,\nefficient, and real-time threat detector in a large-scale operational\nenterprise network requires high accuracy, high fidelity, and a high throughput\nmodel to detect malicious activities. Traditional anomaly-based detection\nmodels, however, suffer from high computational overhead and low detection\naccuracy, making them unsuitable for real-time threat detection. In this work,\nwe propose LogSHIELD, a highly effective graph-based anomaly detection model in\nhost data. We present a real-time threat detection approach using\nfrequency-domain analysis of provenance graphs. To demonstrate the significance\nof graph-based frequency analysis we proposed two approaches. Approach-I uses a\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) LogGNN and approach-II performs frequency domain\nanalysis on graph node samples for graph embedding. Both approaches use a\nstatistical clustering algorithm for anomaly detection. The proposed models are\nevaluated using a large host log dataset consisting of 774M benign logs and\n375K malware logs. LogSHIELD explores the provenance graph to extract\ncontextual and causal relationships among logs, exposing abnormal activities.\nIt can detect stealthy and sophisticated attacks with over 98% average AUC and\nF1 scores. It significantly improves throughput, achieves an average detection\nlatency of 0.13 seconds, and outperforms state-of-the-art models in detection\ntime.",

However, their training involves distinguishing real data\nfrom synthetically generated data using adversarial discriminators, which can\nlead to unstable training dynamics and mode dropping issues. In this work, we\nbuild on the \\textit{invariant statistical loss} (ISL) method introduced in\n\\cite{de2024training}, and extend it to handle heavy-tailed and multivariate\ndata distributions.\n  The data generated by many real-world phenomena can only be properly\ncharacterised using heavy-tailed probability distributions, and traditional\nimplicit methods struggle to effectively capture their asymptotic behavior. To\naddress this problem, we introduce a generator trained with ISL, that uses\ninput noise from a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We refer to this\ngenerative scheme as Pareto-ISL for conciseness. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat Pareto-ISL accurately models the tails of the distributions while still\neffectively capturing their central characteristics.\n  The original ISL function was conceived for 1D data sets. When the actual\ndata is $n$-dimensional, a straightforward extension of the method was obtained\nby targeting the $n$ marginal distributions of the data. This approach is\ncomputationally infeasible and ineffective in high-dimensional spaces. To\novercome this, we extend the 1D approach using random projections and define a\nnew loss function suited for multivariate data, keeping problems tractable by\nadjusting the number of projections. We assess its performance in\nmultidimensional generative modeling and explore its potential as a pretraining\ntechnique for generative adversarial networks (GANs) to prevent mode collapse,\nreporting promising results and highlighting its robustness across various\nhyperparameter settings.",

However, existing research on embedding ethical and moral\nconsiderations into AI remains insufficient, and previous external constraints\nbased on principles and rules are inadequate to provide AI with long-term\nstability and generalization capabilities. In contrast, the intrinsic\naltruistic motivation based on empathy is more willing, spontaneous, and\nrobust. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to autonomously driving intelligent\nagents to acquire morally behaviors through human-like affective empathy\nmechanisms. We draw inspiration from the neural mechanism of human brain's\nmoral intuitive decision-making, and simulate the mirror neuron system to\nconstruct a brain-inspired affective empathy-driven altruistic decision-making\nmodel. Here, empathy directly impacts dopamine release to form intrinsic\naltruistic motivation. Based on the principle of moral utilitarianism, we\ndesign the moral reward function that integrates intrinsic empathy and\nextrinsic self-task goals. A comprehensive experimental scenario incorporating\nempathetic processes, personal objectives, and altruistic goals is developed.\nThe proposed model enables the agent to make consistent moral decisions\n(prioritizing altruism) by balancing self-interest with the well-being of\nothers. We further introduce inhibitory neurons to regulate different levels of\nempathy and verify the positive correlation between empathy levels and\naltruistic preferences, yielding conclusions consistent with findings from\npsychological behavioral experiments. This work provides a feasible solution\nfor the development of ethical AI by leveraging the intrinsic human-like\nempathy mechanisms, and contributes to the harmonious coexistence between\nhumans and AI.",

    "abstract": "Solving algebra problems (APs) continues to attract significant research\ninterest as evidenced by the large number of algorithms and theories proposed\nover the past decade. Despite these important research contributions, however,\nthe body of work remains incomplete in terms of theoretical justification and\nscope. The current contribution intends to fill the gap by developing a review\nframework that aims to lay a theoretical base, create an evaluation scheme, and\nextend the scope of the investigation. This paper first develops the State\nTransform Theory (STT), which emphasizes that the problem-solving algorithms\nare structured according to states and transforms unlike the understanding that\nunderlies traditional surveys which merely emphasize the progress of\ntransforms. The STT, thus, lays the theoretical basis for a new framework for\nreviewing algorithms. This new construct accommodates the relation-centric\nalgorithms for solving both word and diagrammatic algebra problems. The latter\nnot only highlights the necessity of introducing new states but also allows\nrevelation of contributions of individual algorithms obscured in prior reviews\nwithout this approach.",

Diffusion models have been shown to be able to\nlearn the distribution relationships between features in RGB images, and thus\ngenerate new realistic images.In this work, we propose a new approach to\nsolving the ObjectNav task, by training a diffusion model to learn the\nstatistical distribution patterns of objects in semantic maps, and using the\nmap of the explored regions during navigation as the condition to generate the\nmap of the unknown regions, thereby realizing the semantic reasoning of the\ntarget object, i.e., diffusion as reasoning (DAR). Meanwhile, we propose the\nglobal target bias and local LLM bias methods, where the former can constrain\nthe diffusion model to generate the target object more effectively, and the\nlatter utilizes the common sense knowledge extracted from the LLM to improve\nthe generalization of the reasoning process. Based on the generated map in the\nunknown region, the agent sets the predicted location of the target as the goal\nand moves towards it.

To adapt LMMs for\ndownstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) which only trains\nadditional prefix tokens or modules, has gained popularity. Nevertheless, there\nhas been little analysis of how PEFT works in LMMs. In this paper, we delve\ninto the strengths and weaknesses of each tuning strategy, shifting the focus\nfrom the efficiency typically associated with these approaches. We first\ndiscover that model parameter tuning methods such as LoRA and Adapters distort\nthe feature representation space learned during pre-training and limit the full\nutilization of pre-trained knowledge. We also demonstrate that prefix-tuning\nexcels at preserving the representation space, despite its lower performance on\ndownstream tasks. These findings suggest a simple two-step PEFT strategy called\nPrefix-Tuned PEFT (PT-PEFT), which successively performs prefix-tuning and then\nPEFT (i.e., Adapter, LoRA), combines the benefits of both. Experimental results\nshow that PT-PEFT not only improves performance in image captioning and visual\nquestion answering compared to vanilla PEFT methods but also helps preserve the\nrepresentation space of the four pre-trained models.",

One\npromising approach to tackle this challenge is to adopt existing expert video\ndemonstrations for policy learning.

For example,\nreward labeling via Optimal Transport (OT) has been shown to be an effective\nstrategy to generate a proxy reward by measuring the alignment between the\nrobot trajectory and the expert demonstrations.

    "abstract": "A major challenge for Multi-Agent Systems is enabling agents to adapt\ndynamically to diverse environments in which opponents and teammates may\ncontinually change. Agents trained using conventional methods tend to excel\nonly within the confines of their training cohorts; their performance drops\nsignificantly when confronting unfamiliar agents. To address this shortcoming,\nwe introduce Inverse Attention Agents that adopt concepts from the Theory of\nMind (ToM) implemented algorithmically using an attention mechanism trained in\nan end-to-end manner. Crucial to determining the final actions of these agents,\nthe weights in their attention model explicitly represent attention to\ndifferent goals. We furthermore propose an inverse attention network that\ndeduces the ToM of agents based on observations and prior actions. The network\ninfers the attentional states of other agents, thereby refining the attention\nweights to adjust the agent's final action. We conduct experiments in a\ncontinuous environment, tackling demanding tasks encompassing cooperation,\ncompetition, and a blend of both. They demonstrate that the inverse attention\nnetwork successfully infers the attention of other agents, and that this\ninformation improves agent performance. Additional human experiments show that,\ncompared to baseline agent models, our inverse attention agents exhibit\nsuperior cooperation with humans and better emulate human behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in image mixing and generative data augmentation have\nshown promise in enhancing image classification. However, these techniques face\nthe challenge of balancing semantic fidelity with diversity. Specifically,\nimage mixing involves interpolating two images to create a new one, but this\npixel-level interpolation can compromise fidelity. Generative augmentation uses\ntext-to-image generative models to synthesize or modify images, often limiting\ndiversity to avoid generating out-of-distribution data that potentially affects\naccuracy. We propose that this fidelity-diversity dilemma partially stems from\nthe whole-image paradigm of existing methods. Since an image comprises the\nclass-dependent part (CDP) and the class-independent part (CIP), where each\npart has fundamentally different impacts on the image's fidelity, treating\ndifferent parts uniformly can therefore be misleading. To address this\nfidelity-diversity dilemma, we introduce Decoupled Data Augmentation (De-DA),\nwhich resolves the dilemma by separating images into CDPs and CIPs and handling\nthem adaptively. To maintain fidelity, we use generative models to modify real\nCDPs under controlled conditions, preserving semantic consistency. To enhance\ndiversity, we replace the image's CIP with inter-class variants, creating\ndiverse CDP-CIP combinations. Additionally, we implement an online randomized\ncombination strategy during training to generate numerous distinct CDP-CIP\ncombinations cost-effectively.

One widely used technique to tackle MOO is\nthrough linear scalarization, where one fixed preference vector is used to\ncombine the objectives into a single scalar value for optimization. However,\nrecent work (Hu et al., 2024) has shown linear scalarization often fails to\ncapture the non-convex regions of the Pareto Front, failing to recover the\ncomplete set of Pareto optimal solutions. In light of the above limitations,\nthis paper focuses on Tchebycheff scalarization that optimizes for the\nworst-case objective.

When studying how robust these memories are,\nthere appears to be a sweet spot in the spectrum of fact novelty between\nconsistency with world knowledge and total randomness, where the injected\nmemory is the most enduring.

The reference-free Vendi score offers a\nsolution by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based\nentropy measures. The Vendi score is usually computed via the\neigendecomposition of an $n \\times n$ kernel matrix for $n$ generated samples.\nHowever, the heavy computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often\nlimits the sample size used in practice to a few tens of thousands. In this\npaper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi score. We\nnumerically demonstrate that for kernel functions with an infinite feature map\ndimension, the score estimated from a limited sample size may exhibit a\nnon-negligible bias relative to the population Vendi score, i.e., the\nasymptotic limit as the sample size approaches infinity. To address this, we\nintroduce a truncation of the Vendi statistic, called the $t$-truncated Vendi\nstatistic, which is guaranteed to converge to its asymptotic limit given\n$n=O(t)$ samples. We show that the existing Nystr\\\"om method and the FKEA\napproximation method for approximating the Vendi score both converge to the\npopulation truncated Vendi score.

    "abstract": "The fast development of location-based social networks (LBSNs) has led to\nsignificant changes in society, resulting in popular studies of using LBSN data\nfor socioeconomic prediction, e.g., regional population and commercial activity\nestimation. Existing studies design various graphs to model heterogeneous LBSN\ndata, and further apply graph representation learning methods for socioeconomic\nprediction. However, these approaches heavily rely on heuristic ideas and\nexpertise to extract task-relevant knowledge from diverse data, which may not\nbe optimal for specific tasks. Additionally, they tend to overlook the inherent\nrelationships between different indicators, limiting the prediction accuracy.\nMotivated by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in\ncommonsense reasoning, embedding, and multi-agent collaboration, in this work,\nwe synergize LLM agents and knowledge graph for socioeconomic prediction. We\nfirst construct a location-based knowledge graph (LBKG) to integrate\nmulti-sourced LBSN data. Then we leverage the reasoning power of LLM agent to\nidentify relevant meta-paths in the LBKG for each type of socioeconomic\nprediction task, and design a semantic-guided attention module for knowledge\nfusion with meta-paths. Moreover, we introduce a cross-task communication\nmechanism to further enhance performance by enabling knowledge sharing across\ntasks at both LLM agent and KG levels. On the one hand, the LLM agents for\ndifferent tasks collaborate to generate more diverse and comprehensive\nmeta-paths. On the other hand, the embeddings from different tasks are\nadaptively merged for better socioeconomic prediction. Experiments on two\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the synergistic design between LLM\nand KG, providing insights for information sharing across socioeconomic\nprediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Different from the traditional semi-supervised learning paradigm that is\nconstrained by the close-world assumption, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)\npresumes that the unlabeled dataset contains new categories not appearing in\nthe labeled set, and aims to not only classify old categories but also discover\nnew categories in the unlabeled data. Existing studies on GCD typically devote\nto transferring the general knowledge from the self-supervised pretrained model\nto the target GCD task via some fine-tuning strategies, such as partial tuning\nand prompt learning. Nevertheless, these fine-tuning methods fail to make a\nsound balance between the generalization capacity of pretrained backbone and\nthe adaptability to the GCD task. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel adapter-tuning-based method named AdaptGCD, which is the first work to\nintroduce the adapter tuning into the GCD task and provides some key insights\nexpected to enlighten future research. Furthermore, considering the discrepancy\nof supervision information between the old and new classes, a multi-expert\nadapter structure equipped with a route assignment constraint is elaborately\ndevised, such that the data from old and new classes are separated into\ndifferent expert groups.

    "abstract": "Spike train classification has recently become an important topic in the\nmachine learning community, where each spike train is a binary event sequence\nwith \\emph{temporal-sparsity of signals of interest} and \\emph{temporal-noise}\nproperties. A promising model for it should follow the design principle of\nperforming intensive computation only when signals of interest appear. So such\ntasks use mainly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to their consideration of\ntemporal-sparsity of spike trains. However, the basic mechanism of SNNs ignore\nthe temporal-noise issue, which makes them computationally expensive and thus\nhigh power consumption for analyzing spike trains on resource-constrained\nplatforms. As an event-driven model, an SNN neuron makes a reaction given any\ninput signals, making it difficult to quickly find signals of interest. In this\npaper, we introduce an event-attention mechanism that enables SNNs to\ndynamically highlight useful signals of the original spike trains. To this end,\nwe propose SkipSNN, which extends existing SNN models by learning to mask out\nnoise by skipping membrane potential updates and shortening the effective size\nof the computational graph. This process is analogous to how people choose to\nopen and close their eyes to filter the information they see. We evaluate\nSkipSNN on various neuromorphic tasks and demonstrate that it achieves\nsignificantly better computational efficiency and classification accuracy than\nother state-of-the-art SNNs.",

In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch\nsize (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the\nthreshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns.\nTo operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of\nauto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion\nparameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and\ncareful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate\nalong with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on\nCBS.

Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with\ndata size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through\nthe analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and\ninfinite-dimensional least squares regression.

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective,\nincluding finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and\nrecommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that\nhow to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can\nincrease their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better\nreview responses. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-guided Prompt learning\nfor Public Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request\nquality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags\nsubtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt\ntuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by\nconstructing prompt templates using hard prompt; 2) knowledge and code prefix\ntuning which introduces external knowledge by soft prompt, and uses data flow\ndiagrams to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity\nprediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an\nanswer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity\nof our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing\nknowledge.

Many such bundles are ordered in the sense that the individual items\nare consumed sequentially, one at a time. We examine if an individual's\ndecision to consume the next item in an ordered bundle can be predicted based\non his/her consumption pattern for the preceding items. We evaluate several\npredictive models, including two custom Transformers using decoder-only and\nencoder-decoder architectures, fine-tuned GPT-3, a custom LSTM model, a\nreinforcement learning model, two Markov models, and a zero-order model. Using\ndata from Spotify, we find that the custom Transformer with a decoder-only\narchitecture provides the most accurate predictions, both for individual\nchoices and aggregate demand. This model captures a general form of state\ndependence. Analysis of Transformer attention weights suggests that the\nconsumption of the next item in a bundle is based on approximately equal\nweighting of all preceding choices. Our results indicate that the Transformer\ncan assist in queuing the next item that an individual is likely to consume\nfrom an ordered bundle, predicting the demand for individual items, and\npersonalizing promotions to increase demand.",

We address this issue by applying Gaussian blur on\npartial reference mel-spectrogram and adjusting loss weights in these regions.\nExtensive ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency of our method.\nEvaluations on OpenCpop, a Chinese singing dataset, show that RDSinger\noutperforms current state-of-the-art SVS methods in performance.",

    "abstract": "There has been a surge of interest in leveraging speech as a marker of health\nfor a wide spectrum of conditions. The underlying premise is that any\nneurological, mental, or physical deficits that impact speech production can be\nobjectively assessed via automated analysis of speech. Recent advances in\nspeech-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for diagnosing and tracking\nmental health, cognitive, and motor disorders often use supervised learning,\nsimilar to mainstream speech technologies like recognition and verification.\nHowever, clinical speech AI has distinct challenges, including the need for\nspecific elicitation tasks, small available datasets, diverse speech\nrepresentations, and uncertain diagnostic labels. As a result, application of\nthe standard supervised learning paradigm may lead to models that perform well\nin controlled settings but fail to generalize in real-world clinical\ndeployments. With translation into real-world clinical scenarios in mind, this\ntutorial paper provides an overview of the key components required for robust\ndevelopment of clinical speech AI. Specifically, this paper will cover the\ndesign of speech elicitation tasks and protocols most appropriate for different\nclinical conditions, collection of data and verification of hardware,\ndevelopment and validation of speech representations designed to measure\nclinical constructs of interest, development of reliable and robust clinical\nprediction models, and ethical and participant considerations for clinical\nspeech AI. The goal is to provide comprehensive guidance on building models\nwhose inputs and outputs link to the more interpretable and clinically\nmeaningful aspects of speech, that can be interrogated and clinically validated\non clinical datasets, and that adhere to ethical, privacy, and security\nconsiderations by design.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly explored for graph tasks.\nDespite their remarkable success in text-based tasks, LLMs' capabilities in\nunderstanding explicit graph structures remain limited, particularly with large\ngraphs. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Language Model for Graph\n(HLM-G), which employs a two-block architecture to capture node-centric local\ninformation and interaction-centric global structure, effectively enhancing\ngraph structure understanding abilities. The proposed scheme allows LLMs to\naddress various graph queries with high efficacy, efficiency, and robustness,\nwhile reducing computational costs on large-scale graph tasks. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the interpretability of our model using intrinsic attention weights\nand established explainers. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse graph\nreasoning and real-world tasks of node, link, and graph-levels highlight the\nsuperiority of our method, marking a significant advancement in the application\nof LLMs to graph understanding.",

Showcasing the application of our methodology, we introduce the\nMinecraft Persona-driven Dialogue dataset (MCPDial). Starting with a small seed\nof expert-written conversations, we employ our method to generate hundreds of\nadditional conversations. Each conversation in the dataset includes rich\ncharacter descriptions of the player and NPC. The conversations are long,\nallowing for in-depth and extensive interactions between the player and NPC.\nMCPDial extends beyond basic conversations by incorporating canonical function\ncalls (e.g. \"Call find a resource on iron ore\") between the utterances.\nFinally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the dataset to assess its quality\nand characteristics.",

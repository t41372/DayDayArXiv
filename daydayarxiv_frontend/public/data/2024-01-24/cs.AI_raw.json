    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable reasoning\nabilities. However, larger models often surpass their smaller counterparts in\nreasoning tasks, posing the challenge of effectively transferring these\ncapabilities from larger models. Existing approaches heavily rely on extensive\nfine-tuning data or continuous interactions with a superior teacher LLM during\ninference. We introduce a principle-based teacher-student framework called\n``Teaching via Principle Discovery'' (TPD) to address these limitations.\nInspired by human learning mechanisms, TPD mimics the interaction between a\nteacher and a student using a principle-based approach. The teacher LLM\ngenerates problem-solving instructions and corrective principles based on the\nstudent LLM's errors. These principles guide the refinement of instructions and\nthe selection of instructive examples from a validation set. This enables the\nstudent model to learn from both the teacher's guidance and its own mistakes.\nOnce the student model begins making inferences, TPD requires no further\nintervention from the teacher LLM or humans. Through extensive experiments\nacross eight reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TPD. Compared\nto standard chain-of-thought prompting, TPD significantly improves the student\nmodel's performance, achieving $6.2\\%$ improvement on average.",

    "abstract": "Future autonomous vehicles (AVs) will use a variety of sensors that generate\na vast amount of data. Naturally, this data not only serves self-driving\nalgorithms; but can also assist other vehicles or the infrastructure in\nreal-time decision-making. Consequently, vehicles shall exchange their\nmeasurement data over Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies. Moreover,\npredicting the state of the road network might be beneficial too. With such a\nprediction, we might mitigate road congestion, balance parking lot usage, or\noptimize the traffic flow. That would decrease transportation costs as well as\nreduce its environmental impact.\n  In this paper, we propose a federated measurement and learning system that\nprovides real-time data to fellow vehicles over Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)\ncommunication while also operating a federated learning (FL) scheme over the\nVehicle-to-Network (V2N) link to create a predictive model of the\ntransportation network. As we are yet to have real-world AV data, we model it\nwith a non-IID (independent and identically distributed) dataset to evaluate\nthe capabilities of the proposed system in terms of performance and privacy.\nResults indicate that the proposed FL scheme improves learning performance and\nprevents eavesdropping at the aggregator server side.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to establish the causal relationship network between various\nfactors leading to workday loss in underground coal mines using a novel causal\nartificial intelligence (AI) method. The analysis utilizes data obtained from\nthe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). A total of\n101,010 injury records from 3,982 unique underground coal mines spanning the\nyears from 1990 to 2020 were extracted from the NIOSH database. Causal\nrelationships were analyzed and visualized using a novel causal AI method\ncalled Grouped Greedy Equivalence Search (GGES). The impact of each variable on\nworkday loss was assessed through intervention do-calculus adjustment (IDA)\nscores. Model training and validation were performed using the 10-fold\ncross-validation technique. Performance metrics, including adjacency precision\n(AP), adjacency recall (AR), arrowhead precision (AHP), and arrowhead recall\n(AHR), were utilized to evaluate the models. Findings revealed that after 2006,\nkey direct causes of workday loss among mining employees included total mining\nexperience, mean office employees, mean underground employees, county, and\ntotal mining experience (years). Total mining experience emerged as the most\ninfluential factor, whereas mean employees per mine exhibited the least\ninfluence. The analyses emphasized the significant role of total mining\nexperience in determining workday loss. The models achieved optimal\nperformance, with AP, AR, AHP, and AHR values measuring 0.694, 0.653, 0.386,\nand 0.345, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing\nthe new GGES method to clarify the causal factors behind the workday loss by\nanalyzing employment demographics and injury records and establish their causal\nrelationship network.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of interactions among rational agents have long been\nstudied in game theory. However these interactions are often over a small set\nof discrete game actions which is very different from how humans communicate in\nnatural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework that allows\nequilibrium solvers to work over the space of natural language dialogue\ngenerated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by modelling the\nplayers, strategies and payoffs in a \"game\" of dialogue, we create a binding\nfrom natural language interactions to the conventional symbolic logic of game\ntheory. Given this binding, we can ask existing game-theoretic algorithms to\nprovide us with strategic solutions (e.g., what string an LLM should generate\nto maximize payoff in the face of strategic partners or opponents), giving us\npredictors of stable, rational conversational strategies. We focus on three\ndomains that require different negotiation strategies: scheduling meetings,\ntrading fruit and debate, and evaluate an LLM's generated language when guided\nby solvers. We see that LLMs that follow game-theory solvers result in dialogue\ngenerations that are less exploitable than the control (no guidance from\nsolvers), and the language generated results in higher rewards, in all\nnegotiation domains. We discuss future implications of this work, and how\ngame-theoretic solvers that can leverage the expressivity of natural language\ncan open up a new avenue of guiding language research.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models\n(LLMs), become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, the\nability to trust their outputs is crucial. To earn human trust, LLMs must be\nwell calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the\nlikelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused\non LLMs' internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they\nconvey uncertainty to users. Here we explore the calibration gap, which refers\nto the difference between human confidence in LLM-generated answers and the\nmodels' actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well\nhumans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Our\nexperiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users\ntend to overestimate the accuracy of LLM responses when provided with default\nexplanations. Moreover, longer explanations increased user confidence, even\nwhen the extra length did not improve answer accuracy. By adjusting LLM\nexplanations to better reflect the models' internal confidence, both the\ncalibration gap and the discrimination gap narrowed, significantly improving\nuser perception of LLM accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of\naccurate uncertainty communication and highlight the effect of explanation\nlength in influencing user trust in AI-assisted decision-making environments.\nCode and Data can be found at https://osf.io/y7pr6/ .

Police officers, the most visible and contacted agents of\nthe state, interact with the public more than 20 million times a year during\ntraffic stops. Today, these interactions are regularly recorded by body-worn\ncameras (BWCs), which are lauded as a means to enhance police accountability\nand improve police-public interactions.

Our approach begins by identifying the\naspects of communication most salient to different stakeholders, including both\ncommunity members and police officers. We move away from modeling approaches\nbuilt around the existence of a single ground truth and instead utilize new\nadvances in soft labeling to incorporate variation in how different observers\nperceive the same interactions. We argue that this inclusive approach to the\nconceptualization and design of new ML tools is broadly applicable to the study\nof communication and development of analytic tools across domains of human\ninteraction, including education, medicine, and the workplace.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces AlphaMapleSAT, a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\nbased Cube-and-Conquer (CnC) SAT solving method aimed at efficiently solving\nchallenging combinatorial problems. Despite the tremendous success of CnC\nsolvers in solving a variety of hard combinatorial problems, the lookahead\ncubing techniques at the heart of CnC have not evolved much for many years.\nPart of the reason is the sheer difficulty of coming up with new cubing\ntechniques that are both low-cost and effective in partitioning input formulas\ninto sub-formulas, such that the overall runtime is minimized.\n  Lookahead cubing techniques used by current state-of-the-art CnC solvers,\nsuch as March, keep their cubing costs low by constraining the search for the\noptimal splitting variables. By contrast, our key innovation is a\ndeductively-driven MCTS-based lookahead cubing technique, that performs a\ndeeper heuristic search to find effective cubes, while keeping the cubing cost\nlow. We perform an extensive comparison of AlphaMapleSAT against the March CnC\nsolver on challenging combinatorial problems such as the minimum Kochen-Specker\nand Ramsey problems. We also perform ablation studies to verify the efficacy of\nthe MCTS heuristic search for the cubing problem. Results show up to 2.3x\nspeedup in parallel (and up to 27x in sequential) elapsed real time.",

However, the ease of finding adversarial counter-examples remains a\npersistent problem when training times are measured in hours or days and the\ntime needed to find a successful adversarial counter-example is measured in\nseconds. Much work has gone into generating and defending against these\nadversarial counter-examples, however the relative costs of attacks and\ndefences are rarely discussed. Additionally, machine learning research is\nalmost entirely guided by test/train metrics, but these would require billions\nof samples to meet industry standards. The present work addresses the problem\nof understanding and predicting how particular model hyper-parameters influence\nthe performance of a model in the presence of an adversary. The proposed\napproach uses survival models, worst-case examples, and a cost-aware analysis\nto precisely and accurately reject a particular model change during routine\nmodel training procedures rather than relying on real-world deployment,\nexpensive formal verification methods, or accurate simulations of very\ncomplicated systems (\\textit{e.g.}, digitally recreating every part of a car or\na plane). Through an evaluation of many pre-processing techniques, adversarial\ncounter-examples, and neural network configurations, the conclusion is that\ndeeper models do offer marginal gains in survival times compared to more\nshallow counterparts.

For AI-based decision support systems\nin healthcare settings it is paramount to be reliable and trustworthy. Common\ndeep learning approaches, however, have the tendency towards overconfidence\nunder data shift. Such inappropriate extrapolation beyond evidence-based\nscenarios may have dire consequences. This highlights the importance of\nreliable estimation of local uncertainty and its communication to the end user.\nWhile stochastic neural networks have been heralded as a potential solution to\nthese issues, this study investigates their actual reliability in clinical\napplications. We centered our analysis on the exemplary use case of mortality\nprediction for ICU hospitalizations using EHR from MIMIC3 study. For\npredictions on the EHR time series, Encoder-Only Transformer models were\nemployed. Stochasticity of model functions was achieved by incorporating common\nmethods such as Bayesian neural network layers and model ensembles. Our models\nachieve state of the art performance in terms of discrimination performance\n(AUC ROC: 0.868+-0.011, AUC PR: 0.554+-0.034) and calibration on the mortality\nprediction benchmark. However, epistemic uncertainty is critically\nunderestimated by the selected stochastic deep learning methods. A heuristic\nproof for the responsible collapse of the posterior distribution is provided.\nOur findings reveal the inadequacy of commonly used stochastic deep learning\napproaches to reliably recognize OoD samples. In both methods, unsubstantiated\nmodel confidence is not prevented due to strongly biased functional posteriors,\nrendering them inappropriate for reliable clinical decision support. This\nhighlights the need for approaches with more strictly enforced or inherent\ndistance-awareness to known data points, e.g., using kernel-based techniques.",

The key\ntechnological enabler is a novel mechanism for automatic question-answer\ngeneration from procedural text which can ingest large amounts of textual\ninstructions and produce exhaustive in-domain QA training data. While current\nQA data generation methods can produce well-formed and varied data, their\nnon-exhaustive nature is sub-optimal for training a QA model.

    "abstract": "The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance. However, their\nperformance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored. Traditional\nevaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced\ncontexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical\nassessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to\nevaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult\ncritical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods,\nincluding clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the\nperformance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world\nclinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and\nthen labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by\nidentifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different\nprompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior\nperformance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and\ntext-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting\nstrategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable\nefficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.\nConclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for\nLLMs is developed and operationalized. This framework goes beyond singular\nperformance aspects. With expert annotations, this methodology not only\nvalidates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also\nestablishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel study analyzing the effects of various prompt loss token\nweights (PLW) for supervised instruction fine-tuning (SIFT). While\nprompt-masking (PLW = 0) is common for SIFT, some fine-tuning APIs support\nfractional PLWs and suggest that using a small non-zero PLW can help stabilize\nlearning when fine-tuning on short-completion data. However, there has never\nbeen a study confirming this claim, and OpenAI, a major cloud-based SIFT\nprovider, recently removed this parameter from their fine-tuning API. We found\nthat performance of models fine-tuned on short-completion data had a\nstatistically-significant negative quadratic relationship with PLW. Using small\nvalues (0.01 - 0.5) of PLW produced better results on multiple-choice and\nshort-generation benchmarks (outperforming models fine-tuned on long-completion\ndata) while large values (~ 1.0) of PLW produced better results on\nlong-generation benchmarks. We explained this effect and verified its\nimportance through additional experiments. This research serves as a warning to\nAPI providers about the importance of providing a PLW parameter for SIFT.",

To bridge this gap, we present WiMANS, to\nour knowledge, the first dataset for multi-user sensing based on WiFi.

    "abstract": "Iconography and iconology are fundamental domains when it comes to\nunderstanding artifacts of cultural heritage. Iconography deals with the study\nand interpretation of visual elements depicted in artifacts and their\nsymbolism, while iconology delves deeper, exploring the underlying cultural and\nhistorical meanings. Despite the advances in representing cultural heritage\nwith Linked Open Data (LOD), recent studies show persistent gaps in the\nrepresentation of iconographic and iconological statements in current knowledge\ngraphs (KGs). To address them, this paper presents IICONGRAPH, a KG that was\ncreated by refining and extending the iconographic and iconological statements\nof ArCo (the Italian KG of cultural heritage) and Wikidata. The development of\nIICONGRAPH was also driven by a series of requirements emerging from research\ncase studies that were unattainable in the non-reengineered versions of the\nKGs. The evaluation results demonstrate that IICONGRAPH not only outperforms\nArCo and Wikidata through domain-specific assessments from the literature but\nalso serves as a robust platform for addressing the formulated research\nquestions. IICONGRAPH is released and documented in accordance with the FAIR\nprinciples to guarantee the resource's reusability. The algorithms used to\ncreate it and assess the research questions have also been made available to\nensure transparency and reproducibility. While future work focuses on ingesting\nmore data into the KG, and on implementing it as a backbone of LLM-based\nquestion answering systems, the current version of IICONGRAPH still emerges as\na valuable asset, contributing to the evolving landscape of cultural heritage\nrepresentation within Knowledge Graphs, the Semantic Web, and beyond.",

We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high\nexposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure).

Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having\nLLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI\nexposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase\nthe average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, yet updating\ntheir knowledge remains a significant challenge, often leading to outdated or\ninaccurate responses. A proposed solution is the integration of external\nknowledge bases, such as knowledge graphs, with LLMs. Most existing methods use\na paradigm that treats the question as the objective, with relevant knowledge\nbeing incrementally retrieved from the knowledge graph. However, this strategy\nfrequently experiences an mismatch in the granularity of knowledge between the\ntarget question and the entities and relations being retrieved. As a result,\nthe information in the question cannot precisely correspond to the retrieved\nknowledge. This may cause redundant exploration or omission of vital knowledge,\nthereby leading to enhanced computational consumption and reduced retrieval\naccuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm of fine-grained stateful\nknowledge exploration, which addresses the `information granularity mismatch'\nissue. We extract fine-grained information from questions and explore the\nsemantic mapping between this information and the knowledge in graph. By\ndynamically updating the mapping records, we avoid redundant exploration and\nensure no pertinent information is overlooked, thereby reducing computational\noverhead and improving the accuracy of knowledge exploration. The use of\nfine-grained information also eliminates the need for a priori knowledge, a\ncommon requirement in existing methods. Experiments on multiple datasets\nrevealed that our paradigm surpasses current advanced methods in knowledge\nretrieval while significantly reducing the average number of LLM invocations.",

    "abstract": "Thin-plate spline (TPS) is a principal warp that allows for representing\nelastic, nonlinear transformation with control point motions. With the increase\nof control points, the warp becomes increasingly flexible but usually\nencounters a bottleneck caused by undesired issues, e.g., content distortion.\nIn this paper, we explore generic applications of TPS in single-image-based\nwarping tasks, such as rotation correction, rectangling, and portrait\ncorrection. To break this bottleneck, we propose the coupled thin-plate spline\nmodel (CoupledTPS), which iteratively couples multiple TPS with limited control\npoints into a more flexible and powerful transformation. Concretely, we first\ndesign an iterative search to predict new control points according to the\ncurrent latent condition. Then, we present the warping flow as a bridge for the\ncoupling of different TPS transformations, effectively eliminating\ninterpolation errors caused by multiple warps. Besides, in light of the\nlaborious annotation cost, we develop a semi-supervised learning scheme to\nimprove warping quality by exploiting unlabeled data. It is formulated through\ndual transformation between the searched control points of unlabeled data and\nits graphic augmentation, yielding an implicit correction consistency\nconstraint. Finally, we collect massive unlabeled data to exhibit the benefit\nof our semi-supervised scheme in rotation correction. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and universality of CoupledTPS over the existing\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions for rotation correction and beyond.

    "abstract": "Perception occurs when two individuals interpret the same information\ndifferently. Despite being a known phenomenon with implications for bias in\ndecision-making, as individual experience determines interpretation, perception\nremains largely overlooked in machine learning (ML) research. Modern decision\nflows, whether partially or fully automated, involve human experts interacting\nwith ML applications. How might we then, e.g., account for two experts that\ninterpret differently a deferred instance or an explanation from a ML model? To\naccount for perception, we first need to formulate it. In this work, we define\nperception under causal reasoning using structural causal models (SCM). Our\nframework formalizes individual experience as additional causal knowledge that\ncomes with and is used by a human expert (read, decision maker). We present two\nkinds of causal perception, unfaithful and inconsistent, based on the SCM\nproperties of faithfulness and consistency. Further, we motivate the importance\nof perception within fairness problems. We illustrate our framework through a\nseries of decision flow examples involving ML applications and human experts.",

This research introduces an innovative urban planning approach\nintegrating Large Language Models (LLMs) within the participatory process.

Empirical experiments in diverse urban\ncommunities exhibit LLM's adaptability and effectiveness across varied planning\nscenarios.

Further analysis shows the advantage\nof LLM agents in providing adjustable and inclusive solutions with natural\nlanguage reasoning and strong scalability. While implementing the recent\nadvancements in emulating human behavior for planning, this work envisions both\nplanners and citizens benefiting from low-cost, efficient LLM agents, which is\ncrucial for enhancing participation and realizing participatory urban planning.",

    "abstract": "Manual parameter tuning of cyber-physical systems is a common practice, but\nit is labor-intensive. Bayesian Optimization (BO) offers an automated\nalternative, yet its black-box nature reduces trust and limits human-BO\ncollaborative system tuning. Experts struggle to interpret BO recommendations\ndue to the lack of explanations. This paper addresses the post-hoc BO\nexplainability problem for cyber-physical systems. We introduce TNTRules\n(Tune-No-Tune Rules), a novel algorithm that provides both global and local\nexplanations for BO recommendations. TNTRules generates actionable rules and\nvisual graphs, identifying optimal solution bounds and ranges, as well as\npotential alternative solutions. Unlike existing explainable AI (XAI) methods,\nTNTRules is tailored specifically for BO, by encoding uncertainty via a\nvariance pruning technique and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. A\nmulti-objective optimization approach allows maximizing explanation quality. We\nevaluate TNTRules using established XAI metrics (Correctness, Completeness, and\nCompactness) and compare it against adapted baseline methods. The results\ndemonstrate that TNTRules generates high-fidelity, compact, and complete\nexplanations, significantly outperforming three baselines on 5 multi-objective\ntesting functions and 2 hyperparameter tuning problems.",

This creates a gap between conveyed information and\ninformation that matters to those who are impacted by the system's decisions,\nsuch as domain experts and decision subjects. To address this, we present the\n\"XAI Novice Question Bank,\" an extension of the XAI Question Bank containing a\ncatalog of information needs from AI novices in two use cases: employment\nprediction and health monitoring. The catalog covers the categories of data,\nsystem context, system usage, and system specifications. We gathered\ninformation needs through task-based interviews where participants asked\nquestions about two AI systems to decide on their adoption and received verbal\nexplanations in response. Our analysis showed that participants' confidence\nincreased after receiving explanations but that their understanding faced\nchallenges. These included difficulties in locating information and in\nassessing their own understanding, as well as attempts to outsource\nunderstanding. Additionally, participants' prior perceptions of the systems'\nrisks and benefits influenced their information needs. Participants who\nperceived high risks sought explanations about the intentions behind a system's\ndeployment, while those who perceived low risks rather asked about the system's\noperation. Our work aims to support the inclusion of AI novices in\nexplainability efforts by highlighting their information needs, aims, and\nchallenges.

Further, we perform\nhuman evaluations of the model responses and observe a significant performance\ngap of 30.8% between GPT-4V (the current best-performing Large Multimodal\nModel) and human performance. Our fine-grained analysis reveals that GPT-4V\nencounters difficulties interpreting time-related data and infographics.\nHowever, it demonstrates proficiency in comprehending abstract visual contexts\nsuch as memes and quotes.

This task presents a\nsignificant challenge due to the implicit meaning embedded in memes, which is\nnot explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image. However, existing\nharmful meme detection methods do not present readable explanations that unveil\nsuch implicit meaning to support their detection decisions. In this paper, we\npropose an explainable approach to detect harmful memes, achieved through\nreasoning over conflicting rationales from both harmless and harmful positions.\nSpecifically, inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs)\non text generation and reasoning, we first elicit multimodal debate between\nLLMs to generate the explanations derived from the contradictory arguments.\nThen we propose to fine-tune a small language model as the debate judge for\nharmfulness inference, to facilitate multimodal fusion between the harmfulness\nrationales and the intrinsic multimodal information within memes. In this way,\nour model is empowered to perform dialectical reasoning over intricate and\nimplicit harm-indicative patterns, utilizing multimodal explanations\noriginating from both harmless and harmful arguments. Extensive experiments on\nthree public meme datasets demonstrate that our harmful meme detection approach\nachieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a\nsuperior capacity for explaining the meme harmfulness of the model predictions.",

    "abstract": "Finding a concise and interpretable mathematical formula that accurately\ndescribes the relationship between each variable and the predicted value in the\ndata is a crucial task in scientific research, as well as a significant\nchallenge in artificial intelligence. This problem is referred to as symbolic\nregression, which is an NP-hard problem. In the previous year, a novel symbolic\nregression methodology utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was advanced,\nachieving state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of datasets. although\nthis algorithm has shown considerable improvement in recovering target\nexpressions compared to previous methods, the lack of guidance during the MCTS\nprocess severely hampers its search efficiency. Recently, some algorithms have\nadded a pre-trained policy network to guide the search of MCTS, but the\npre-trained policy network generalizes poorly. To optimize the trade-off\nbetween efficiency and versatility, we introduce SR-GPT, a novel algorithm for\nsymbolic regression that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a\nGenerative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). By using GPT to guide the MCTS, the\nsearch efficiency of MCTS is significantly improved. Next, we utilize the MCTS\nresults to further refine the GPT, enhancing its capabilities and providing\nmore accurate guidance for the MCTS. MCTS and GPT are coupled together and\noptimize each other until the target expression is successfully determined. We\nconducted extensive evaluations of SR-GPT using 222 expressions sourced from\nover 10 different symbolic regression datasets. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that SR-GPT outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in\naccurately recovering symbolic expressions both with and without added noise.",

This\nstudy presents RefreshNet, a multiscale framework developed to overcome these\nchallenges, delivering an unprecedented balance between computational\nefficiency and predictive accuracy. RefreshNet incorporates convolutional\nautoencoders to identify a reduced order latent space capturing essential\nfeatures of the dynamics, and strategically employs multiple recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) blocks operating at varying temporal resolutions within the\nlatent space, thus allowing the capture of latent dynamics at multiple temporal\nscales.

This design demonstrates superiority over existing techniques\nregarding computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, especially in\nlong-term forecasting. The framework is validated using three benchmark\napplications: the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, the Reaction-Diffusion equation, and\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky dynamics. RefreshNet significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in long-term forecasting accuracy and speed, marking a\nsignificant advancement in modeling complex systems and opening new avenues in\nunderstanding and predicting their behavior.",

    "abstract": "Automatic image colorization is inherently an ill-posed problem with\nuncertainty, which requires an accurate semantic understanding of scenes to\nestimate reasonable colors for grayscale images. Although recent\ninteraction-based methods have achieved impressive performance, it is still a\nvery difficult task to infer realistic and accurate colors for automatic\ncolorization. To reduce the difficulty of semantic understanding of grayscale\nscenes, this paper tries to utilize corresponding audio, which naturally\ncontains extra semantic information about the same scene. Specifically, a novel\nand pluggable audio-infused automatic image colorization (AIAIC) method is\nproposed, which consists of three stages. First, we take color image semantics\nas a bridge and pretrain a colorization network guided by color image\nsemantics. Second, the natural co-occurrence of audio and video is utilized to\nlearn the color semantic correlations between audio and visual scenes. Third,\nthe implicit audio semantic representation is fed into the pretrained network\nto finally realize the audio-guided colorization. The whole process is trained\nin a self-supervised manner without human annotation. Experiments demonstrate\nthat audio guidance can effectively improve the performance of automatic\ncolorization, especially for some scenes that are difficult to understand only\nfrom visual modality.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains deploy Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) to determine which user\ntransactions to include in blocks and determine their payments (i.e.,\ntransaction fees). Increasing demand and scarce block resources have led to\nhigh user transaction fees. As these blockchains are a public resource, it may\nbe preferable to reduce these transaction fees. To this end, we introduce\nTransaction Fee Redistribution Mechanisms (TFRMs) -- redistributing VCG\npayments collected from such TFM as rebates to minimize transaction fees.\nClassic redistribution mechanisms (RMs) achieve this while ensuring Allocative\nEfficiency (AE) and User Incentive Compatibility (UIC). Our first result shows\nthe non-triviality of applying RM in TFMs. More concretely, we prove that it is\nimpossible to reduce transaction fees when (i) transactions that are not\nconfirmed do not receive rebates and (ii) the miner can strategically\nmanipulate the mechanism. Driven by this, we propose \\emph{Robust} TFRM\n(\\textsf{R-TFRM}): a mechanism that compromises on an honest miner's individual\nrationality to guarantee strictly positive rebates to the users. We then\nintroduce \\emph{robust} and \\emph{rational} TFRM (\\textsf{R}$^2$\\textsf{-TFRM})\nthat uses trusted on-chain randomness that additionally guarantees miner's\nindividual rationality (in expectation) and strictly positive rebates.

Enabling language models to\ngenerate acting tokens facilitates interaction with various knowledge sources,\nallowing them to adapt their behavior to diverse task requirements. Meanwhile,\nevaluation tokens gauge the relevance score between the dialogue context and\nthe retrieved evidence. In addition, we carefully design a self-refinement\nmechanism to iteratively refine the generated response considering 1) the\nconsistency scores between the generated response and retrieved evidence; and\n2) the relevance scores.

However, crowdsourcing introduces issues related to the\nannotator's experience, consistency, and biases. An alternative is to use\nzero-shot methods, which in turn have limitations compared to their few-shot or\nfully supervised counterparts. Recent advancements driven by large language\nmodels show potential, but struggle to adapt to specialized domains with\nseverely limited data. The most common approaches therefore involve the human\nitself randomly annotating a set of datapoints to build initial datasets.

The proposed AdCorDA method is based on\nmodification of the training set and making use of the duality between network\nweights and layer inputs. We call this input space training. The method\nconsists of two stages - adversarial correction followed by domain adaptation.\nAdversarial correction uses adversarial attacks to correct incorrect\ntraining-set classifications. The incorrectly classified samples of the\ntraining set are removed and replaced with the adversarially corrected samples\nto form a new training set, and then, in the second stage, domain adaptation is\nperformed back to the original training set. Extensive experimental validations\nshow significant accuracy boosts of over 5% on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The\ntechnique can be straightforwardly applied to refinement of weight-quantized\nneural networks, where experiments show substantial enhancement in performance\nover the baseline. The adversarial correction technique also results in\nenhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples are one critical security threat to various visual\napplications, where injected human-imperceptible perturbations can confuse the\noutput.Generating transferable adversarial examples in the black-box setting is\ncrucial but challenging in practice. Existing input-diversity-based methods\nadopt different image transformations, but may be inefficient due to\ninsufficient input diversity and an identical perturbation step size. Motivated\nby the fact that different image regions have distinctive weights in\nclassification, this paper proposes a black-box adversarial generative\nframework by jointly designing enhanced input diversity and adaptive step\nsizes. We design local mixup to randomly mix a group of transformed adversarial\nimages, strengthening the input diversity. For precise adversarial generation,\nwe project the perturbation into the $tanh$ space to relax the boundary\nconstraint. Moreover, the step sizes of different regions can be dynamically\nadjusted by integrating a second-order momentum.Extensive experiments on\nImageNet validate that our framework can achieve superior transferability\ncompared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

In this work, we take initial steps in\ndeveloping robust LWMs that can generalize to compositionally novel language\ndescriptions.

We\ndevise a more robust model by fusing the Transformer with the EMMA attention\nmechanism (Hanjie et al., 2021). Our model substantially outperforms the\nTransformer and approaches the performance of a model with an oracle semantic\nparsing and grounding capability.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have achieved satisfactory results in\nmany tasks. However, their performance in the task of ReID (ReID) has not been\nexplored to date. This paper will investigate how to adapt them for the task of\nReID. An intuitive idea is to fine-tune MLLM with ReID image-text datasets, and\nthen use their visual encoder as a backbone for ReID. However, there still\nexist two apparent issues: (1) Designing instructions for ReID, MLLMs may\noverfit specific instructions, and designing a variety of instructions will\nlead to higher costs. (2) When fine-tuning the visual encoder of a MLLM, it is\nnot trained synchronously with the ReID task. As a result, the effectiveness of\nthe visual encoder fine-tuning cannot be directly reflected in the performance\nof the ReID task. To address these problems, this paper proposes MLLMReID:\nMultimodal Large Language Model-based ReID. Firstly, we proposed Common\nInstruction, a simple approach that leverages the essence ability of LLMs to\ncontinue writing, avoiding complex and diverse instruction design. Secondly, we\npropose a multi-task learning-based synchronization module to ensure that the\nvisual encoder of the MLLM is trained synchronously with the ReID task.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has made significant advances in computer vision, particularly\nin image classification tasks. Despite their high accuracy on training data,\ndeep learning models often face challenges related to complexity and\noverfitting. One notable concern is that the model often relies heavily on a\nlimited subset of filters for making predictions. This dependency can result in\ncompromised generalization and an increased vulnerability to minor variations.\nWhile regularization techniques like weight decay, dropout, and data\naugmentation are commonly used to address this issue, they may not directly\ntackle the reliance on specific filters. Our observations reveal that the heavy\nreliance problem gets severe when slow-learning filters are deprived of\nlearning opportunities due to fast-learning filters. Drawing inspiration from\nimage augmentation research that combats over-reliance on specific image\nregions by removing and replacing parts of images, our idea is to mitigate the\nproblem of over-reliance on strong filters by substituting highly activated\nfeatures. To this end, we present a novel method called Catch-up Mix, which\nprovides learning opportunities to a wide range of filters during training,\nfocusing on filters that may lag behind. By mixing activation maps with\nrelatively lower norms, Catch-up Mix promotes the development of more diverse\nrepresentations and reduces reliance on a small subset of filters. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of our method in various vision\nclassification datasets, providing enhanced robustness.",

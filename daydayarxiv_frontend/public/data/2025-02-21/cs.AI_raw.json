    "abstract": "Despite increasing discussions on open-source Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nexisting research lacks a discussion on the transparency and accessibility of\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) Large Language Models (LLMs). The Open Source\nInitiative (OSI) has recently released its first formal definition of\nopen-source software. This definition, when combined with standard dictionary\ndefinitions and the sparse published literature, provide an initial framework\nto support broader accessibility to AI models such as LLMs, but more work is\nessential to capture the unique dynamics of openness in AI. In addition,\nconcerns about open-washing, where models claim openness but lack full\ntransparency, has been raised, which limits the reproducibility, bias\nmitigation, and domain adaptation of these models. In this context, our study\ncritically analyzes SoTA LLMs from the last five years, including ChatGPT,\nDeepSeek, LLaMA, and others, to assess their adherence to transparency\nstandards and the implications of partial openness. Specifically, we examine\ntransparency and accessibility from two perspectives: open-source vs.\nopen-weight models. Our findings reveal that while some models are labeled as\nopen-source, this does not necessarily mean they are fully open-sourced. Even\nin the best cases, open-source models often do not report model training data,\nand code as well as key metrics, such as weight accessibility, and carbon\nemissions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that\nsystematically examines the transparency and accessibility of over 100\ndifferent SoTA LLMs through the dual lens of open-source and open-weight\nmodels. The findings open avenues for further research and call for responsible\nand sustainable AI practices to ensure greater transparency, accountability,\nand ethical deployment of these models.(DeepSeek transparency, ChatGPT\naccessibility, open source, DeepSeek open source)",

Traditional approaches for\nannotating query-product pairs rely on human-based labeling services, which is\nexpensive, time-consuming and prone to errors. In this work, we explore the\napplication of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate query-product relevance\nlabeling for large-scale e-commerce search. We use several publicly available\nand proprietary LLMs for this task, and conducted experiments on two\nopen-source datasets and an in-house e-commerce search dataset. Using prompt\nengineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, In-context\nLearning (ICL), and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Maximum Marginal\nRelevance (MMR), we show that LLM's performance has the potential to approach\nhuman-level accuracy on this task in a fraction of the time and cost required\nby human-labelers, thereby suggesting that our approach is more efficient than\nthe conventional methods. We have generated query-product relevance labels\nusing LLMs at scale, and are using them for evaluating improvements to our\nsearch algorithms. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve\nquery-product relevance thus enhancing e-commerce search user experience.

First, we consider a naive collaboration\nprotocol where the local and remote models simply chat back and forth.

Prior works\naddress this by compressing the KV cache, but often assume specific structural\nproperties of the embeddings. This raises the following natural question: Can\ntruly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this\nwork, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for\nattention-based token generation must use $\\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the\nnumber of tokens generated so far and $d = \\Omega(\\log n)$ is the dimension of\nthe KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication\ncomplexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties\nof projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the\nlow-dimensional regime $d = o(\\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires\n$\\Omega(d\\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers,\nthat SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this\nbound.

    "abstract": "Objective: To optimize in-context learning in biomedical natural language\nprocessing by improving example selection. Methods: We introduce a novel\nmulti-mode retrieval-augmented generation (MMRAG) framework, which integrates\nfour retrieval strategies: (1) Random Mode, selecting examples arbitrarily; (2)\nTop Mode, retrieving the most relevant examples based on similarity; (3)\nDiversity Mode, ensuring variation in selected examples; and (4) Class Mode,\nselecting category-representative examples. This study evaluates MMRAG on three\ncore biomedical NLP tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction\n(RE), and Text Classification (TC). The datasets used include BC2GM for gene\nand protein mention recognition (NER), DDI for drug-drug interaction extraction\n(RE), GIT for general biomedical information extraction (RE), and HealthAdvice\nfor health-related text classification (TC). The framework is tested with two\nlarge language models (Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B) and three retrievers (Contriever,\nMedCPT, BGE-Large) to assess performance across different retrieval strategies.\nResults: The results from the Random mode indicate that providing more examples\nin the prompt improves the model's generation performance. Meanwhile, Top mode\nand Diversity mode significantly outperform Random mode on the RE (DDI) task,\nachieving an F1 score of 0.9669, a 26.4% improvement. Among the three\nretrievers tested, Contriever outperformed the other two in a greater number of\nexperiments. Additionally, Llama 2 and Llama 3 demonstrated varying\ncapabilities across different tasks, with Llama 3 showing a clear advantage in\nhandling NER tasks. Conclusion: MMRAG effectively enhances biomedical\nin-context learning by refining example selection, mitigating data scarcity\nissues, and demonstrating superior adaptability for NLP-driven healthcare\napplications.",

The\ncomplete drying up of a lake has caused a community environmental catastrophe.\nIn this study, we presented an optimization problem to determine the total\nsurface runoff to maintain the level of salinity lake (Urmia Lake). The\nproposed process has two key stages: identifying the influential factors in\ndetermining the lake water level using sensitivity analysis approaches based\nupon historical data and optimizing the effective variable to stabilize the\nlake water level under changing design variables. Based upon the Sobol'-Jansen\nand Morris techniques, the groundwater level and total surface runoff flow are\nhighly effective with nonlinear and interacting impacts of the lake water\nlevel. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, we found that it may be\npossible to effectively manage lake levels by adjusting total surface runoff.\nWe used genetic algorithms, non-linear optimization, and pattern search\ntechniques to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the lake level\nconstraint is established based on a pattern as a constant number every month.\nIn order to maintain a consistent pattern of lake levels, it is necessary to\nincrease surface runoff by approximately 8.7 times during filling season. It is\nnecessary to increase this quantity by 33.5 times during the draining season.\nIn the future, the results may serve as a guide for the rehabilitation of the\nlake.",

D2Z is superior across a range of model sizes,\nbatch sizes, datasets, and vocabularies. Benefits increase as dataset size\nincreases.

In\nexperiments, a 610M-parameter model trained for 80 tokens-per-parameter (TPP)\nusing D2Z achieves lower loss than when trained for 200 TPP using 10x decay,\ncorresponding to an astonishing 60% compute savings.

    "abstract": "Medicare fraud poses a substantial challenge to healthcare systems, resulting\nin significant financial losses and undermining the quality of care provided to\nlegitimate beneficiaries. This study investigates the use of machine learning\n(ML) to enhance Medicare fraud detection, addressing key challenges such as\nclass imbalance, high-dimensional data, and evolving fraud patterns. A dataset\ncomprising inpatient claims, outpatient claims, and beneficiary details was\nused to train and evaluate five ML models: Random Forest, KNN, LDA, Decision\nTree, and AdaBoost. Data preprocessing techniques included resampling SMOTE\nmethod to address the class imbalance, feature selection for dimensionality\nreduction, and aggregation of diagnostic and procedural codes. Random Forest\nemerged as the best-performing model, achieving a training accuracy of 99.2%\nand validation accuracy of 98.8%, and F1-score (98.4%). The Decision Tree also\nperformed well, achieving a validation accuracy of 96.3%. KNN and AdaBoost\ndemonstrated moderate performance, with validation accuracies of 79.2% and\n81.1%, respectively, while LDA struggled with a validation accuracy of 63.3%\nand a low recall of 16.6%. The results highlight the importance of advanced\nresampling techniques, feature engineering, and adaptive learning in detecting\nMedicare fraud effectively. This study underscores the potential of machine\nlearning in addressing the complexities of fraud detection. Future work should\nexplore explainable AI and hybrid models to improve interpretability and\nperformance, ensuring scalable and reliable fraud detection systems that\nprotect healthcare resources and beneficiaries.",

Existing methods\nprimarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the\npre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and\npre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and\ncan sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional\nGradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that\nincorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization\nand multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image\nclassification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the\nmulti-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first\nbridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image\nClassification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and\nfurther categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution\nshift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show\nthat DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image\nClassfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones,\nimproving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.",

    "abstract": "Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders\ntheir practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To\naccelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion\nmodel into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation,\nwhich matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the\nteacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be\nmode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach\nusing a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that\ncovers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode\ncoverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence\nbetween the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as\nthe product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by\ntheir density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with\nhigher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking\ndivergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach\nusing the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as\nforward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best\nvariational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In\nparticular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current\nstate-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot\ntext-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

Hierarchical approaches offer\na pathway for achieving this goal by executing skill combinations arranged by a\ntask planner, with each visuomotor skill pre-trained using a specific imitation\nlearning (IL) algorithm. However, even in simple long-horizon tasks like skill\nchaining, hierarchical approaches often struggle due to a problem we identify\nas Observation Space Shift (OSS), where the sequential execution of preceding\nskills causes shifts in the observation space, disrupting the performance of\nsubsequent individually trained skill policies. To validate OSS and evaluate\nits impact on long-horizon tasks, we introduce BOSS (a Benchmark for\nObservation Space Shift). BOSS comprises three distinct challenges: \"Single\nPredicate Shift\", \"Accumulated Predicate Shift\", and \"Skill Chaining\", each\ndesigned to assess a different aspect of OSS's negative effect. We evaluated\nseveral recent popular IL algorithms on BOSS, including three Behavioral\nCloning methods and the Visual Language Action model OpenVLA. Even on the\nsimplest challenge, we observed average performance drops of 67%, 35%, 34%, and\n54%, respectively, when comparing skill performance with and without OSS.\nAdditionally, we investigate a potential solution to OSS that scales up the\ntraining data for each skill with a larger and more visually diverse set of\ndemonstrations, with our results showing it is not sufficient to resolve OSS.\nThe project page is: https://boss-benchmark.github.io/",

One approach is to add the entire repo to the LLM's context window.\nHowever, most tasks involve only fraction of symbols from a repo, longer\ncontexts are detrimental to the LLM's reasoning abilities, and context windows\nare not unlimited. Alternatively, we could emulate the human ability to\nnavigate a large repo, pick out the right functionality, and form a plan to\nsolve the task.

MutaGReP performs neural tree\nsearch in plan space, exploring by mutating plans and using a symbol retriever\nfor grounding. On the challenging LongCodeArena benchmark, our plans use less\nthan 5% of the 128K context window for GPT-4o but rival the coding performance\nof GPT-4o with a context window filled with the repo. Plans produced by\nMutaGReP allow Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B and 72B to match the performance of GPT-4o\nwith full repo context and enable progress on the hardest LongCodeArena tasks.\nProject page: zaidkhan.me/MutaGReP",

These challenges include truthfulness, where models\ngenerate misleading information; privacy, with risks of unintentional data\nretention; robustness, requiring defenses against adversarial attacks;\nfairness, addressing biases in clinical outcomes; explainability, ensuring\ntransparent decision-making; and safety, mitigating risks of misinformation and\nmedical errors.

    "abstract": "This study investigates how individuals' perceptions of artificial\nintelligence (AI) limitations influence organizational readiness for AI\nadoption. Through semi-structured interviews with seven AI implementation\nexperts, analyzed using the Gioia methodology, the research reveals that\norganizational readiness emerges through dynamic interactions between\nindividual sensemaking, social learning, and formal integration processes. The\nfindings demonstrate that hands-on experience with AI limitations leads to more\nrealistic expectations and increased trust, mainly when supported by peer\nnetworks and champion systems. Organizations that successfully translate these\nindividual and collective insights into formal governance structures achieve\nmore sustainable AI adoption. The study advances theory by showing how\norganizational readiness for AI adoption evolves through continuous cycles of\nindividual understanding, social learning, and organizational adaptation. These\ninsights suggest that organizations should approach AI adoption not as a\none-time implementation but as an ongoing strategic learning process that\nbalances innovation with practical constraints. The research contributes to\norganizational readiness theory and practice by illuminating how micro-level\nperceptions and experiences shape macro-level adoption outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The leading AI companies are increasingly focused on building generalist AI\nagents -- systems that can autonomously plan, act, and pursue goals across\nalmost all tasks that humans can perform. Despite how useful these systems\nmight be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and\nsecurity, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible\nloss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI\ntraining methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated\nthe possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were\nnot specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such\nas self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong\nneed for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven\ntrajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further\nadvances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and\nsafe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain\nthe world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or\nplease humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain\ndata and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with\nan explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident\npredictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to\nassist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI\nsafety. In particular, our system can be employed as a guardrail against AI\nagents that might be created despite the risks involved. Ultimately, focusing\non non-agentic AI may enable the benefits of AI innovation while avoiding the\nrisks associated with the current trajectory. We hope these arguments will\nmotivate researchers, developers, and policymakers to favor this safer path.",

However, recent studies have found that there are still\nsignificant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper\nsummarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical\nquestion answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within\ncomplex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or\nabductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical\nconsistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves\nacross different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw\nquestion-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and\nDoes a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To\nfacilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most\ncutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods.\nSpecifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods\ncan be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining,\nand fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and\nsolutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation,\ntransitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we\nreview commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss\npromising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for\nuncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies\nsimultaneously.",

We systematically analyze\nchain-of-thought length across o1-mini and o3-mini variants on the Omni-MATH\nbenchmark, finding that o3-mini (m) achieves superior accuracy without\nrequiring longer reasoning chains than o1-mini. Moreover, we show that accuracy\ngenerally declines as reasoning chains grow across all models and compute\nsettings, even when controlling for difficulty of the questions. This accuracy\ndrop is significantly smaller in more proficient models, suggesting that new\ngenerations of reasoning models use test-time compute more effectively.\nFinally, we highlight that while o3-mini (h) achieves a marginal accuracy gain\nover o3-mini (m), it does so by allocating substantially more reasoning tokens\nacross all problems, even the ones that o3-mini (m) can already solve.

    "abstract": "We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic,\nstructured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise\nmanner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute\nequally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch\neffectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for\ndifferent batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed\npruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet\ncrucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model\nlayers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically\nintegrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it\nstructurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP\nimportance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of\neach weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full\ninference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its\ncompatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional\nneural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on\nLLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of\nFLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs.\nFor instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56\ntimes lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction\ncompared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful\nin-context learning capabilities. However, their predictions can be disrupted\nby factually correct context, a phenomenon known as context hijacking,\nrevealing a significant robustness issue. To understand this phenomenon\ntheoretically, we explore an in-context linear classification problem based on\nrecent advances in linear transformers. In our setup, context tokens are\ndesigned as factually correct query-answer pairs, where the queries are similar\nto the final query but have opposite labels. Then, we develop a general\ntheoretical analysis on the robustness of the linear transformers, which is\nformulated as a function of the model depth, training context lengths, and\nnumber of hijacking context tokens. A key finding is that a well-trained deeper\ntransformer can achieve higher robustness, which aligns with empirical\nobservations. We show that this improvement arises because deeper layers enable\nmore fine-grained optimization steps, effectively mitigating interference from\ncontext hijacking. This is also well supported by our numerical experiments.\nOur findings provide theoretical insights into the benefits of deeper\narchitectures and contribute to enhancing the understanding of transformer\narchitectures.",

In our\nframework, a coordinator agent manages the overall process and works with two\nspecialized LLM agents to complete the scene creation: ForgeIt, which\nintegrates an ever-growing manual through auto-verification to enable precise\ncustomization of individual objects, and ArrangeIt, which formulates\nhierarchical optimization problems to achieve a layout that balances ergonomic\nand aesthetic considerations. Additionally, our pipeline incorporates a\ntrajectory control agent, allowing users to animate the scene and operate the\ncamera through natural language interactions.

    "abstract": "Long-context modelling for large language models (LLMs) has been a key area\nof recent research because many real world use cases require reasoning over\nlonger inputs such as documents. The focus of research into modelling long\ncontext has been on how to model position and there has been little\ninvestigation into other important aspects of language modelling such as\ninstruction tuning. Long context training examples are challenging and\nexpensive to create and use. In this paper, we investigate how to design\ninstruction data for the post-training phase of a long context pre-trained\nmodel: how much and what type of context is needed for optimal and efficient\npost-training. Our controlled study reveals that models instruction-tuned on\nshort contexts can effectively generalize to longer ones, while also\nidentifying other critical factors such as instruction difficulty and context\ncomposition. Based on these findings, we propose context synthesis, a novel\ndata synthesis framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs to generate extended\nbackground contexts for high-quality instruction-answer pairs. Experiment\nresults on the document-level benchmark (LongBench) demonstrate that our\nproposed approach outperforms previous instruction synthesis approaches and\ncomes close to the performance of human-annotated long-context instruction\ndata.

On ImageNet-100, DP\ngenerates 3.4x fewer samples and requires six times fewer iterations, while on\nImageNet-1k, it generates 8x fewer samples with a 30 percent reduction in\niterations, all while achieving superior performance compared to prior work.",

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of multimodal content online, pre-trained\nvisual-language models have shown great potential for multimodal\nrecommendation. However, while these models achieve decent performance when\napplied in a frozen manner, surprisingly, due to significant domain gaps (e.g.,\nfeature distribution discrepancy and task objective misalignment) between\npre-training and personalized recommendation, adopting a joint training\napproach instead leads to performance worse than baseline. Existing approaches\neither rely on simple feature extraction or require computationally expensive\nfull model fine-tuning, struggling to balance effectiveness and efficiency. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose \\textbf{P}arameter-efficient\n\\textbf{T}uning for \\textbf{M}ultimodal \\textbf{Rec}ommendation\n(\\textbf{PTMRec}), a novel framework that bridges the domain gap between\npre-trained models and recommendation systems through a knowledge-guided\ndual-stage parameter-efficient training strategy.

    "abstract": "Safety and reliability are crucial for the public acceptance of autonomous\ndriving. To ensure accurate and reliable environmental perception, intelligent\nvehicles must exhibit accuracy and robustness in various environments.\nMillimeter-wave radar, known for its high penetration capability, can operate\neffectively in adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog.\nTraditional 3D millimeter-wave radars can only provide range, Doppler, and\nazimuth information for objects. Although the recent emergence of 4D\nmillimeter-wave radars has added elevation resolution, the radar point clouds\nremain sparse due to Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) operations. In contrast,\ncameras offer rich semantic details but are sensitive to lighting and weather\nconditions. Hence, this paper leverages these two highly complementary and\ncost-effective sensors, 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera. By integrating 4D\nradar spectra with depth-aware camera images and employing attention\nmechanisms, we fuse texture-rich images with depth-rich radar data in the\nBird's Eye View (BEV) perspective, enhancing 3D object detection. Additionally,\nwe propose using GAN-based networks to generate depth images from radar spectra\nin the absence of depth sensors, further improving detection accuracy.",

However,\ntraditional ANNs often struggle to align with brain regions due to their\nexcessive depth and lack of biologically realistic features, like recurrent\nconnection. To address this, a brain-like auditory network (BAN) is introduced,\nwhich incorporates four neuroanatomically mapped areas and recurrent\nconnection, guided by a novel metric called the brain-like auditory score\n(BAS). BAS serves as a benchmark for evaluating the similarity between BAN and\nhuman auditory recognition pathway.

    "abstract": "In the field of affective computing, traditional methods for generating\nemotions predominantly rely on deep learning techniques and large-scale emotion\ndatasets. However, deep learning techniques are often complex and difficult to\ninterpret, and standardizing large-scale emotional datasets are difficult and\ncostly to establish. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework\nnamed Audio-Visual Fusion for Brain-like Emotion Learning(AVF-BEL). In contrast\nto conventional brain-inspired emotion learning methods, this approach improves\nthe audio-visual emotion fusion and generation model through the integration of\nmodular components, thereby enabling more lightweight and interpretable emotion\nlearning and generation processes. The framework simulates the integration of\nthe visual, auditory, and emotional pathways of the brain, optimizes the fusion\nof emotional features across visual and auditory modalities, and improves upon\nthe traditional Brain Emotional Learning (BEL) model. The experimental results\nindicate a significant improvement in the similarity of the audio-visual fusion\nemotion learning generation model compared to single-modality visual and\nauditory emotion learning and generation model. Ultimately, this aligns with\nthe fundamental phenomenon of heightened emotion generation facilitated by the\nintegrated impact of visual and auditory stimuli. This contribution not only\nenhances the interpretability and efficiency of affective intelligence but also\nprovides new insights and pathways for advancing affective computing\ntechnology.

By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an\nadaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance\nwith a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor\npost-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR\nachieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby\noffering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard\ndevices.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language\nunderstanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step\ncalled LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on\nimproving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as\nbatching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both\ncompute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify\nand map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of\nboth processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We\nobserve that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a\nkernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet\nuser and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and\ncomputation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach\nof designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even\nin memory-bound kernels.\n  In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the\ndynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI\n(PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that\nexploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to\nsuitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel\ncharacterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware\nunits at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that\nharmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid\nPIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on\nthree broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\\times$ and 11.1$\\times$\nspeedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a\nstate-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit excellent performance in various tasks.\nHowever, the memory requirements of LLMs present a great challenge when\ndeploying on memory-limited devices, even for quantized LLMs. This paper\nintroduces a framework to compress LLM after quantization further, achieving\nabout 2.2x compression ratio. A compression-aware quantization is first\nproposed to enhance model weight compressibility by re-scaling the model\nparameters before quantization, followed by a pruning method to improve\nfurther. Upon this, we notice that decompression can be a bottleneck during\npractical scenarios. We then give a detailed analysis of the trade-off between\nmemory usage and latency brought by the proposed method. A speed-adaptive\nmethod is proposed to overcome it. The experimental results show inference with\nthe compressed model can achieve a 40% reduction in memory size with negligible\nloss in accuracy and inference speed.",

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become ubiquitous for efficiently fine-tuning\nfoundation models. However, federated fine-tuning using LoRA is challenging due\nto suboptimal updates arising from traditional federated averaging of\nindividual adapters. Existing solutions either incur prohibitively high\ncommunication cost that scales linearly with the number of clients or suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to limited expressivity. We introduce\nFederated Silver Bullet (Fed-SB), a novel approach for federated fine-tuning of\nLLMs using LoRA-SB, a recently proposed low-rank adaptation method. LoRA-SB\noptimally aligns the optimization trajectory with the ideal low-rank full\nfine-tuning projection by learning a small square matrix (R) between adapters B\nand A, keeping other components fixed. Direct averaging of R guarantees exact\nupdates, substantially reducing communication cost, which remains independent\nof the number of clients, and enables scalability. Fed-SB achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic\nreasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by\nup to 230x. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1)\nreducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for\ndifferential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other\nmethods. Overall, Fed-SB establishes a new Pareto frontier in the tradeoff\nbetween communication and performance, offering an efficient and scalable\nsolution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

This\napproach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose\ncoupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures\nthat combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved\nperformance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our\nresults show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both\nlearning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction\nfor scalable multi-agent systems.",

Accurate and automated segmentation\nof these tumors in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is crucial to\nassess tumor burden and monitor disease progression. In this study, we present\nand analyze a fully automated pipeline for NF segmentation in fat-suppressed\nT2-weighted WB-MRI, consisting of three stages: anatomy segmentation, NF\nsegmentation, and tumor candidate classification. In the first stage, we use\nthe MRSegmentator model to generate an anatomy segmentation mask, extended with\na high-risk zone for NFs. This mask is concatenated with the input image as\nanatomical context information for NF segmentation. The second stage employs an\nensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets to produce an NF\nsegmentation confidence mask. In the final stage, tumor candidates are\nextracted from the confidence mask and classified based on radiomic features,\ndistinguishing tumors from non-tumor regions and reducing false positives. We\nevaluate the proposed pipeline on three test sets representing different\nconditions: in-domain data (test set 1), varying imaging protocols and field\nstrength (test set 2), and low tumor burden cases (test set 3). Experimental\nresults show a 68% improvement in per-scan Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), a\n21% increase in per-tumor DSC, and a two-fold improvement in F1 score for tumor\ndetection in high tumor burden cases by integrating anatomy information.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose and investigate a new class of Generalized\nExponentiated Gradient (GEG) algorithms using Mirror Descent (MD) approaches,\nand applying as a regularization function the Bregman divergence with\ntwo-parameter deformation of logarithm as a link function. This link function\n(referred to as the Euler logarithm) is associated with a wide class of\ngeneralized entropies. In order to derive novel GEG/MD updates, we estimate\ngeneralized exponential function, which closely approximates the inverse of the\nEuler two-parameter logarithm. The characteristic/shape and properties of the\nEuler logarithm and its inverse -- deformed exponential functions are tuned by\ntwo or even more hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can\nadapt to distribution of training data, and we can adjust them to achieve\ndesired properties of gradient descent algorithms. The concept of generalized\nentropies and associated deformed logarithms provide deeper insight into novel\ngradient descent updates.\n  In literature, there exist nowadays over fifty mathematically well-defined\nentropic functionals and associated deformed logarithms, so impossible to\ninvestigate all of them in one research paper. Therefore, we focus here on a\nwide-class of trace-form entropies and associated generalized logarithm. We\napplied the developed algorithms for Online Portfolio Selection (OPLS) in order\nto improve its performance and robustness.",

The content of the drawings heavily relies on the\ntask, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The\ninterpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the\nresearchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model\n(LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific\nthemes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic\nsimilarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing\nrepresentations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a\nnorm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for\nfollow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation\nof most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity\ngreater than 0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the\nrepresentation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition),\nindicating the existence of consistency bias.

Given selected\ncontext sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these\nsentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while\nensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that\nthe attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning\nsmall LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains.

Current GSRs often\nutilize composite or in-depth structures for graph encoding (e.g., the Graph\nTransformer). Nevertheless, they have high computational complexity, hindering\nthe deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Moreover, the relative\nposition encoding in Graph Transformer has difficulty in considering the\ncomplicated positional dependencies within sequence. To this end, we propose an\nExternal Attentive Graph convolutional network with Positional prompts for\nSequential recommendation, namely EA-GPS. Specifically, we first introduce an\nexternal attentive graph convolutional network that linearly measures the\nglobal associations among nodes via two external memory units. Then, we present\na positional prompt-based decoder that explicitly treats the absolute item\npositions as external prompts. By introducing length-adaptive sequential\nmasking and a soft attention network, such a decoder facilitates the model to\ncapture the long-term positional dependencies and contextual relationships\nwithin sequences. Extensive experimental results on five real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed EA-GPS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nRemarkably, it achieves the superior performance while maintaining a smaller\nparameter size and lower training overhead.

    "abstract": "As more and more internet users post images online to express their daily\nemotions, image sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention.\nRecently, researchers generally tend to design different neural networks to\nextract visual features from images for sentiment analysis. Despite the\nsignificant progress, metadata, the data (e.g., text descriptions and keyword\ntags) for describing the image, has not been sufficiently explored in this\ntask. In this paper, we propose a novel Metadata Enhanced Transformer for\nsentiment analysis (SentiFormer) to fuse multiple metadata and the\ncorresponding image into a unified framework. Specifically, we first obtain\nmultiple metadata of the image and unify the representations of diverse data.\nTo adaptively learn the appropriate weights for each metadata, we then design\nan adaptive relevance learning module to highlight more effective information\nwhile suppressing weaker ones. Moreover, we further develop a cross-modal\nfusion module to fuse the adaptively learned representations and make the final\nprediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority and rationality of our proposed method.",

However, the noise of complex\nenvironment may lead to motion-blur or occlusion problems, which raise the\ntough challenge to real-time recognition with high accuracy and robust.

We firstly use convolutional\nencoders to extract and encode the traffic sign features of augmented training\nsamples and standard images. Then, we design the Siamese neural network with\nEfficient-CNN based encoder and contrastive loss function, which can be trained\nto improve the robustness of TSR problem when facing the samples of motion-blur\nand occlusion by computing the distance between inputs and templates.\nAdditionally, the template branch of the proposed network can be stopped when\nexecuting the recognition tasks after training to raise the process speed of\nour real-time model, and alleviate the computational resource and parameter\nscale. Finally, we recombined the feature code and a fully-connected layer with\nSoftMax function to classify the codes of samples and recognize the category of\ntraffic signs. The results of experiments on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset\nand the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed IECESnetwork.

Three main types of KV cache\ncompression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization,\nhave been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K\ncache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations.\nSince the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after\nonly a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware\nquantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective\nallocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we\nprove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are\nmuch lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space.\nOur findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can\nachieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined\nwith key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for\nattention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance.\nNotably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates\nthat SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more\nefficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research\nfocus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in\nreal-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are\ndeployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel\ntask, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents\nunique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by\nadding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning,\nwhere expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for\ntimely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible\nspatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to\ntackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based\nspatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D\nsamples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic\nwhile still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph.\nWe introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates\na negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning\nand graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the\nframework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF\nperformance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three\npotential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental\nresults show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly\non expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the\nexpanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete\nobservations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores\nthe generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.",

Specifically, by treating\nthe result of Monte Carlo sampling as a single sample from the prior\nground-truth Binomial distribution, we quantify the sampling error as the\nmismatch between posterior estimated distribution and ground-truth\ndistribution, which is thus optimized via distribution selection optimization.\nWe test the performance of value-based process verifiers on Best-of-N task and\nBeam search task. Compared with the scalar value representation, we show that\nreasonable structural prior injection induced by different objective functions\nor optimization methods can improve the performance of value-based process\nverifiers for about 1$\\sim$2 points at little-to-no cost. We also show that\nunder different structural prior, the verifiers' performances vary greatly\ndespite having the same optimal solution, indicating the importance of\nreasonable structural prior injection.",

Despite\nrecent advancements, this task remains challenging due to limited training data\nand laborious triplet annotation processes. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes to synthesize the training triplets to augment the training resource\nfor the CIR problem. Specifically, we commence by training a modification text\ngenerator exploiting large-scale multimodal models and scale up the CIR\nlearning throughout both the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. During\npretraining, we leverage the trained generator to directly create Modification\nText-oriented Synthetic Triplets(MTST) conditioned on pairs of images. For\nfine-tuning, we first synthesize reverse modification text to connect the\ntarget image back to the reference image. Subsequently, we devise a two-hop\nalignment strategy to incrementally close the semantic gap between the\nmultimodal pair and the target image. We initially learn an implicit prototype\nutilizing both the original triplet and its reversed version in a cycle manner,\nfollowed by combining the implicit prototype feature with the modification text\nto facilitate accurate alignment with the target image. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the efficacy of the generated triplets and confirm that our proposed\nmethodology attains competitive recall on both the CIRR and FashionIQ\nbenchmarks.",

To address this, we present\nPairBench, a low-cost framework that systematically evaluates VLMs as\ncustomizable similarity tools across various modalities and scenarios. Through\nPairBench, we introduce four metrics that represent key desiderata of\nsimilarity scores: alignment with human annotations, consistency for data pairs\nirrespective of their order, smoothness of similarity distributions, and\ncontrollability through prompting. Our analysis demonstrates that no model,\nwhether closed- or open-source, is superior on all metrics; the optimal choice\ndepends on an auto evaluator's desired behavior (e.g., a smooth vs. a sharp\njudge), highlighting risks of widespread adoption of VLMs as evaluators without\nthorough assessment.

    "abstract": "Graph-language models (GLMs) have demonstrated great potential in graph-based\nsemi-supervised learning. A typical GLM consists of two key stages: graph\ngeneration and text embedding, which are usually implemented by inferring a\nlatent graph and finetuning a language model (LM), respectively. However, the\nformer often relies on artificial assumptions about the underlying edge\ndistribution, while the latter requires extensive data annotations. To tackle\nthese challenges, this paper introduces a novel GLM that integrates graph\ngeneration and text embedding within a unified framework. Specifically, for\ngraph generation, we leverage an inherent characteristic of real edge\ndistribution--the scale-free property--as a structural prior. We unexpectedly\nfind that this natural property can be effectively approximated by a simple\nk-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph. For text embedding, we develop a graph-based\npseudo-labeler that utilizes scale-free graphs to provide complementary\nsupervision for improved LM finetuning. Extensive experiments on representative\ndatasets validate our findings on the scale-free structural approximation of\nKNN graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graph generation\nand text embedding with a real structural prior.

While traditional language models have demonstrated\nproficiency in distinguishing between neutral text and non-neutral text (i.e.\nextreme speech), categorizing the diverse types of extreme speech presents\nsignificant challenges. The task of extreme speech classification is\nparticularly nuanced, as it requires a deep understanding of socio-cultural\ncontexts to accurately interpret the intent of the language used by the\nspeaker.

Although GPT-based models\noutperform Llama models in zero-shot settings, the performance gap disappears\nafter fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation\nperformance by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data with limited labeled\nsamples. Existing methods often suffer from coupling, where over-reliance on\ninitial labeled data leads to suboptimal learning; confirmation bias, where\nincorrect predictions reinforce themselves repeatedly; and boundary blur caused\nby limited boundary-awareness and ambiguous edge cues. To address these issues,\nwe propose CW-BASS, a novel framework for SSSS. In order to mitigate the impact\nof incorrect predictions, we assign confidence weights to pseudo-labels.\nAdditionally, we leverage boundary-delineation techniques, which, despite being\nextensively explored in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), remain\nunderutilized in SSSS. Specifically, our method: (1) reduces coupling via a\nconfidence-weighted loss that adjusts pseudo-label influence based on their\npredicted confidence scores, (2) mitigates confirmation bias with a dynamic\nthresholding mechanism that learns to filter out pseudo-labels based on model\nperformance, (3) tackles boundary blur using a boundary-aware module to refine\nsegmentation near object edges, and (4) reduces label noise through a\nconfidence decay strategy that progressively refines pseudo-labels during\ntraining. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate\nthat CW-BASS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, CW-BASS achieves a\n65.9% mIoU on Cityscapes under a challenging and underexplored 1/30 (3.3%)\nsplit (100 images), highlighting its effectiveness in limited-label settings.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/psychofict/CW-BASS.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used\nfine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language\nModel (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives\ndriving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective\ncomparisons rather than a global preference between two choices.\nMulti-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and\nachieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a\nsingle unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely\non linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives\nsuch as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation\nis computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for\nretraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address\nthis limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem\ninto a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear\naggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend\nour framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct\nweights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or\nmaximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be\neasily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our\ntheoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the\noptimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is\nespecially valuable in specialized domains, where precision is critical. To\nmore specialize the LLMs into a target domain, domain-specific RAG has recently\nbeen developed by allowing the LLM to access the target domain early via\nfinetuning. The domain-specific RAG makes more sense in resource-constrained\nenvironments like edge devices, as they should perform a specific task (e.g.\npersonalization) reliably using only small-scale LLMs. While the\ndomain-specific RAG is well-aligned with edge devices in this respect, it often\nrelies on widely-used reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). The\nreasoning step is useful to understand the given external knowledge, and yet it\nis computationally expensive and difficult for small-scale LLMs to learn it.\nTackling this, we propose the Chain of Rank (CoR) which shifts the focus from\nintricate lengthy reasoning to simple ranking of the reliability of input\nexternal documents. Then, CoR reduces computational complexity while\nmaintaining high accuracy, making it particularly suited for\nresource-constrained environments.

Additionally, limiting the\ndiversity of token processing functions throughout training improves causal\nstructure learning via ICL.

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems remains a critical challenge,\nparticularly in handling rare but potentially catastrophic safety-critical\nscenarios. While existing research has explored generating safety-critical\nscenarios for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing, there is limited work on\neffectively incorporating these scenarios into policy learning to enhance\nsafety. Furthermore, developing training curricula that adapt to an AV's\nevolving behavioral patterns and performance bottlenecks remains largely\nunexplored. To address these challenges, we propose CurricuVLM, a novel\nframework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable personalized\ncurriculum learning for autonomous driving agents. Our approach uniquely\nexploits VLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities to analyze agent behavior,\nidentify performance weaknesses, and dynamically generate tailored training\nscenarios for curriculum adaptation. Through comprehensive analysis of unsafe\ndriving situations with narrative descriptions, CurricuVLM performs in-depth\nreasoning to evaluate the AV's capabilities and identify critical behavioral\npatterns. The framework then synthesizes customized training scenarios\ntargeting these identified limitations, enabling effective and personalized\ncurriculum learning. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset\nshow that CurricuVLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across both regular\nand safety-critical scenarios, achieving superior performance in terms of\nnavigation success, driving efficiency, and safety metrics. Further analysis\nreveals that CurricuVLM serves as a general approach that can be integrated\nwith various RL algorithms to enhance autonomous driving systems.

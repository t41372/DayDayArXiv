    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) systems, while achieving remarkable success across various domains, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.",

While methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have proven effective in English, they often fail to generalize robustly to multilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.",

    "abstract": "Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization remains a significant challenge, particularly for long documents, where conventional metrics struggle with input length limitations and long-range dependencies. In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization. We release all code, perturbed data, and scripts required to reproduce our results at https://github.com/zainmujahid/metricEval-longSum.",

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.",

The system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation with DALL-E 3 text-to-image generation, creating consistent VGA-style visuals as players embody Malinowski during his Trobriand Islands fieldwork (1915-1918). To address ethical concerns, indigenous peoples appear as silhouettes while Malinowski is detailed, prompting reflection on anthropological representation. Two validation studies confirmed effectiveness: Study 1 with 10 non-specialists showed strong learning outcomes (average quiz score 7.5/10) and excellent usability (SUS: 83/100). Study 2 with 4 expert anthropologists confirmed pedagogical value, with one senior researcher discovering \"new aspects\" of Malinowski's work through gameplay. The findings demonstrate that AI-driven educational games can effectively convey complex anthropological concepts while sparking disciplinary curiosity.

On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research.

    "abstract": "Classroom environments are particularly challenging for children with hearing impairments, where background noise, multiple talkers, and reverberation degrade speech perception. These difficulties are greater for children than adults, yet most deep learning speech separation models for assistive devices are developed using adult voices in simplified, low-reverberation conditions. This overlooks both the higher spectral similarity of children's voices, which weakens separation cues, and the acoustic complexity of real classrooms. We address this gap using MIMO-TasNet, a compact, low-latency, multi-channel architecture suited for real-time deployment in bilateral hearing aids or cochlear implants. We simulated naturalistic classroom scenes with moving child-child and child-adult talker pairs under varying noise and distance conditions. Training strategies tested how well the model adapts to children's speech through spatial cues. Models trained on adult speech, classroom data, and finetuned variants were compared to assess data-efficient adaptation. Results show that adult-trained models perform well in clean scenes, but classroom-specific training greatly improves separation quality. Finetuning with only half the classroom data achieved comparable gains, confirming efficient transfer learning. Training with diffuse babble noise further enhanced robustness, and the model preserved spatial awareness while generalizing to unseen distances. These findings demonstrate that spatially aware architectures combined with targeted adaptation can improve speech accessibility for children in noisy classrooms, supporting future on-device assistive technologies.",

    "abstract": "Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.",

Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments.

A dedicated hardware design with on-chip fractal and flexible parallelism further enables fully parallel processing within limited memory resources. Implemented in 28 nm technology as a chip layout with a core area of 1.5 $mm^2$, FractalCloud achieves 21.7x speedup and 27x energy reduction over state-of-the-art accelerators while maintaining network accuracy, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for PNN inference.",

This integration allows users to write declarative queries that combine relational operations with semantic reasoning, enabling them to query both structured and unstructured data effortlessly. However, making semantic operations efficient at production scale poses fundamental challenges. Semantic operations are more expensive than traditional SQL operations, possess distinct latency and throughput characteristics, and their cost and selectivity are unknown during query compilation. Furthermore, existing query engines are not designed to optimize semantic operations. The AISQL query execution engine addresses these challenges through three novel techniques informed by production deployment data from Snowflake customers. First, AI-aware query optimization treats AI inference cost as a first-class optimization objective, reasoning about large language model (LLM) cost directly during query planning to achieve 2-8$\\times$ speedups. Second, adaptive model cascades reduce inference costs by routing most rows through a fast proxy model while escalating uncertain cases to a powerful oracle model, achieving 2-6$\\times$ speedups while maintaining 90-95% of oracle model quality. Third, semantic join query rewriting lowers the quadratic time complexity of join operations to linear through reformulation as multi-label classification tasks, achieving 15-70$\\times$ speedups with often improved prediction quality. AISQL is deployed in production at Snowflake, where it powers diverse customer workloads across analytics, search, and content understanding.",

    "abstract": "Reservoir inflow prediction is crucial for water resource management, yet existing approaches mainly focus on single-reservoir models that ignore spatial dependencies among interconnected reservoirs. We introduce AdaTrip as an adaptive, time-varying graph learning framework for multi-reservoir inflow forecasting. AdaTrip constructs dynamic graphs where reservoirs are nodes with directed edges reflecting hydrological connections, employing attention mechanisms to automatically identify crucial spatial and temporal dependencies. Evaluation on thirty reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrates superiority over existing baselines, with improved performance for reservoirs with limited records through parameter sharing. Additionally, AdaTrip provides interpretable attention maps at edge and time-step levels, offering insights into hydrological controls to support operational decision-making.

    "abstract": "Context: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into core software systems is accelerating. However, existing software architecture patterns are static, while current safety assurance methods are not scalable, leaving systems vulnerable to novel adversarial threats.\n  Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a novel software architecture that enables an AI-driven system to autonomously and continuously adapt its own safety protocols at runtime.\n  Method: We propose the Self-Improving Safety Framework (SISF), a runtime architecture that couples an unprotected, unaligned base LLM (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) with a dynamic feedback loop. This loop consists of an AI Adjudicator (GPT-4o) for breach detection and a Policy Synthesis Module (GPT-4 Turbo) that autonomously generates new, generalized safety policies (both heuristic and semantic) in response to failures.\n  Results: We conducted a dynamic learning evaluation using the 520-prompt AdvBench dataset. The unprotected model was 100% vulnerable. Our SISF, starting from zero policies, demonstrated a clear learning curve: it detected 237 breaches, autonomously synthesized 234 new policies, and reduced the overall Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 45.58%. In a subsequent test on 520 benign prompts, the SISF achieved a 0.00% False Positive Rate (FPR), proving its ability to adapt without compromising user utility.\n  Conclusion: An architectural approach to AI safety, based on the principles of self-adaptation, is a viable and effective strategy. Our framework demonstrates a practical path towards building more robust, resilient, and scalable AI-driven systems, shifting safety assurance from a static, pre-deployment activity to an automated, runtime process.",

When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\\varepsilon\\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is severely hampered by the challenge of evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.",

    "abstract": "A common practice in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is to condition parameters on node/edge types, assuming types reflect semantic roles. However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of crowdsourced data has significantly reshaped social science, enabling extensive exploration of collective human actions, viewpoints, and societal dynamics. However, ensuring safe, fair, and reliable participation remains a persistent challenge. Traditional polling methods have seen a notable decline in engagement over recent decades, raising concerns about the credibility of collected data. Meanwhile, social and peer-to-peer networks have become increasingly widespread, but data from these platforms can suffer from credibility issues due to fraudulent or ineligible participation. In this paper, we explore how social interactions can help restore credibility in crowdsourced data collected over social networks. We present an empirical study to detect ineligible participation in a polling task through AI-based graph analysis of social interactions among imperfect participants composed of honest and dishonest actors. Our approach focuses solely on the structure of social interaction graphs, without relying on the content being shared. We simulate different levels and types of dishonest behavior among participants who attempt to propagate the task within their social networks. We conduct experiments on real-world social network datasets, using different eligibility criteria and modeling diverse participation patterns. Although structural differences in social interaction graphs introduce some performance variability, our study achieves promising results in detecting ineligibility across diverse social and behavioral profiles, with accuracy exceeding 90% in some configurations.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.",

    "abstract": "Financial institutions deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) for reconciliations, regulatory reporting, and client communications, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine auditability and trust. We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.\n  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.\n  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity. Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments.

Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.",

We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so.

The transformer-based model employs hierarchical self-attention to capture both local anatomical structures and long-range spatial dependencies. Predicted fluence maps were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System for dose recalculation, and model performance was evaluated using beam-wise fluence correlation, spatial gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics.

This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed.

We present Lightning Grasp, a novel high-performance procedural grasp synthesis algorithm that achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, while enabling unsupervised grasp generation for irregular, tool-like objects. The method avoids many limitations of prior approaches, such as the need for carefully tuned energy functions and sensitive initialization. This breakthrough is driven by a key insight: decoupling complex geometric computation from the search process via a simple, efficient data structure - the Contact Field. This abstraction collapses the problem complexity, enabling a procedural search at unprecedented speeds. We open-source our system to propel further innovation in robotic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "We study language generation in the limit, where an algorithm observes an adversarial enumeration of strings from an unknown target language $K$ and must eventually generate new, unseen strings from $K$. Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.\n  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).\n  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.\n  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. This suggests curriculum learning may be crucial for learning from noisy web data.",

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents.

We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment.

The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.",

To overcome this problem, we propose a Voice-Interactive Surgical Agent (VISA) built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework consisting of an orchestration agent and three task-specific agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLM-based agents autonomously plan, refine, validate, and reason to interpret voice commands and execute tasks such as retrieving clinical information, manipulating CT scans, or navigating 3D anatomical models within surgical video. We construct a dataset of 240 user commands organized into hierarchical categories and introduce the Multi-level Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) that evaluates the performance and robustness at both the command and category levels. Experimental results demonstrate that VISA achieves high stage-level accuracy and workflow-level success rates, while also enhancing its robustness by correcting transcription errors, resolving linguistic ambiguity, and interpreting diverse free-form expressions. These findings highlight the strong potential of VISA to support robotic surgery and its scalability for integrating new functions and agents.",

A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.",

While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment. The consistent superiority across all distance ranges validates that our dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.",

In privacy-concerned federated learning scenarios, conventional deduplication methods typically rely on trusted third parties to perform uniform deletion, risking loss of informative samples while introducing privacy vulnerabilities. To address these gaps, we propose Federated ReWeighting (FedRW), the first privacy-preserving framework, to the best of our knowledge, that performs soft deduplication via sample reweighting instead of deletion in federated LLM training, without assuming a trusted third party. At its core, FedRW proposes a secure, frequency-aware reweighting protocol through secure multi-party computation, coupled with a parallel orchestration strategy to ensure efficiency and scalability. During training, FedRW utilizes an adaptive reweighting mechanism with global sample frequencies to adjust individual loss contributions, effectively improving generalization and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that FedRW outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving up to 28.78x speedup in preprocessing and approximately 11.42% improvement in perplexity, while offering enhanced security guarantees. FedRW thus establishes a new paradigm for managing duplication in federated LLM training.",

Popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and inference-time reward aggregation are typically analyzed from a performance perspective, leaving their effects on the underlying reasoning distribution less understood. In this work, we study post-training reasoning from a stochastic trajectory viewpoint. Following Kim et al. (2025), we model reasoning steps of varying difficulty as Markov transitions with different probabilities, and formalize reasoning processes using tree-structured Markov chains. Within this framework, pretraining corresponds to discovering the reasoning structure, while post-training primarily reweights existing chains of thought. We show that both RLVR and inference-time reward aggregation concentrate probability mass on a small number of high-probability trajectories, leading to the suppression of rare but essential reasoning paths. As a consequence, solving hard instances often depends on low-probability trajectories already present in the base model. We further prove that exploration-oriented mechanisms, such as rejecting easy instances and applying KL regularization, help preserve these rare trajectories. Empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "$n$-particle reduced density matrices ($n$-RDMs) play a central role in understanding correlated phases of matter. Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\\times 6 \\sim 8\\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\\%$ and $92.78\\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.",

    "abstract": "Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.",

    "abstract": "Infrared imagery enables temperature-based scene understanding using passive sensors, particularly under conditions of low visibility where traditional RGB imaging fails. Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with deep test-time memorization modules, such as Titans and TTT, represent a promising, linearly-scaling paradigm distinct from Transformers. While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.",

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.",

While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited.

It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,.

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.",

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.",

However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.",

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.",

    "abstract": "Robustness is a important problem in AI alignment and safety, with models such as neural networks being increasingly used in safety-critical systems. In the last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e., checking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input is slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized encoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In this paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify variants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a specification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to capture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of robustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its outputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all such variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to the neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network verification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while incurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having 138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a wide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a significant margin.",

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.",

This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.",

Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base.

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.",

While numerous methods have been proposed to detect anomalous objects on the road, leveraging the vision-language space-which provides rich linguistic knowledge-remains an underexplored field. We hypothesize that incorporating these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.\n  To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance when using guidance methods such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enhance output quality by modifying the sampling trajectory. These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and improves reliability without requiring any model retraining.",

To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in settings where ensuring robustness, fairness, or domain-specific properties is essential for regulation compliance and alignment with human values. However, especially on Neural Networks, property enforcement is very challenging, and existing methods are limited to specific constraints or local properties (defined around datapoints), or fail to provide full guarantees. We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks. Our approach is competitive with property-specific baselines in terms of accuracy and runtime, and strictly superior in terms of generality and level of guarantees. Overall, our results emphasize the potential of the SMiLE framework as a platform for future research and applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we trace the evolution of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) over the past 25 years. While MIR gathers all kinds of research related to music informatics, a large part of it focuses on signal processing techniques for music data, fostering a close relationship with the IEEE Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing Technical Commitee. In this paper, we reflect the main research achievements of MIR along the three EDICS related to music analysis, processing and generation. We then review a set of successful practices that fuel the rapid development of MIR research. One practice is the annual research benchmark, the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange, where participants compete on a set of research tasks. Another practice is the pursuit of reproducible and open research. The active engagement with industry research and products is another key factor for achieving large societal impacts and motivating younger generations of students to join the field. Last but not the least, the commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion ensures MIR to be a vibrant and open community where various ideas, methodologies, and career pathways collide. We finish by providing future challenges MIR will have to face.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.",

This work-in-progress paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models have shown strong potential as rerankers to enhance the overall performance of RAG systems. However, existing reranking paradigms are constrained by a core theoretical and practical dilemma: Pointwise methods, while simple and highly flexible, evaluate documents independently, making them prone to the Ranking Myopia Trap, overlooking the relative importance between documents. In contrast, Listwise methods can perceive the global ranking context, but suffer from inherent List Rigidity, leading to severe scalability and flexibility issues when handling large candidate sets. To address these challenges, we propose Groupwise, a novel reranking paradigm. In this approach, the query and a group of candidate documents are jointly fed into the model, which performs within-group comparisons to assign individual relevance scores to each document. This design retains the flexibility of Pointwise methods while enabling the comparative capability of Listwise methods. We further adopt GRPO for model training, equipped with a heterogeneous reward function that integrates ranking metrics with a distributional reward aimed at aligning score distributions across groups. To overcome the bottleneck caused by the scarcity of high quality labeled data, we further propose an innovative pipeline for synthesizing high quality retrieval and ranking data. The resulting data can be leveraged not only for training the reranker but also for training the retriever. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.",

Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability challenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class exclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative simulation study of LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with explicit energy and CO2e quantification. Our results inform hybrid deployment strategies that default to efficient CNNs for routine inference and selectively engage VLMs for complex contextual reasoning.",

Unlike existing LLM-based approaches, AdaRec eliminates manual feature engineering through semantic representations and supports rapid cross-task adaptation with minimal supervision. Experiments on real ecommerce datasets demonstrate that AdaRec outperforms both machine learning models and LLM-based baselines by up to eight percent in few-shot settings. In zero-shot scenarios, it achieves up to a nineteen percent improvement over expert-crafted profiling, showing effectiveness for long-tail personalization with minimal interaction data. Furthermore, lightweight fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by AdaRec matches the performance of fully fine-tuned models, highlighting its efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks.",

    "abstract": "Label learning is a fundamental task in machine learning that aims to construct intelligent models using labeled data, encompassing traditional single-label and multi-label classification models. Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.",

Recent developments in EEG-based depression analysis have shown promise in improving depression detection accuracies. However, EEG features often contain redundant, irrelevant, and noisy information. Additionally, real-world EEG data acquisition frequently faces challenges, such as data loss from electrode detachment and heavy noise interference. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel feature selection approach for robust depression analysis, called Incomplete Depression Feature Selection with Missing EEG Channels (IDFS-MEC). IDFS-MEC integrates missing-channel indicator information and adaptive channel weighting learning into orthogonal regression to lessen the effects of incomplete channels on model construction, and then utilizes global redundancy minimization learning to reduce redundant information among selected feature subsets. Extensive experiments conducted on MODMA and PRED-d003 datasets reveal that the EEG feature subsets chosen by IDFS-MEC have superior performance than 10 popular feature selection methods among 3-, 64-, and 128-channel settings.",

In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.",

In this paper, we propose a new method for leak detection. The method is based on water pressure measurements acquired at a series of nodes of a WDN. Our technique is a fully data-driven solution that makes only use of the knowledge of the WDN topology, and a series of pressure data acquisitions obtained in absence of leaks. The proposed solution is based on an feature extractor and a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained on no-leak data, so that leaks are detected as anomalies.

We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high-dimensional image dataset.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through \\emph{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting, which enables step-by-step intermediate reasoning. However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Explicit latent variable models provide a flexible yet powerful framework for data synthesis, enabling controlled manipulation of generative factors. With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.",

We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents.

A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.",

Evaluations across 14 leading LLMs reveal a concerning vulnerability: an average jailbreak success rate of 57.8%. In response, we propose MENTOR, a metacognition-driven self-evolution framework. MENTOR first performs structured self-assessment through simulated critical thinking, such as perspective-taking and consequential reasoning to uncover latent model misalignments. These reflections are formalized into dynamic rule-based knowledge graphs that evolve with emerging risk patterns. To enforce these rules at inference time, we introduce activation steering, a method that directly modulates the model's internal representations to ensure compliance. Experiments demonstrate that MENTOR substantially reduces attack success rates across all tested domains and achieves risk analysis performance comparable to human experts.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.",

    "abstract": "Improving the quality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), such as through super-resolution, is a crucial research area. However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity.",

However, malicious exploitation like voice-cloning fraud poses severe security risks. Existing defense techniques struggle to address the production large language model (LLM)-based speech synthesis. While previous studies have considered the protection for fine-tuning synthesizers, they assume manually annotated transcripts. Given the labor intensity of manual annotation, end-to-end (E2E) systems leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate transcripts are becoming increasingly prevalent, e.g., voice cloning via commercial APIs. Therefore, this E2E speech synthesis also requires new security mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose E2E-VGuard, a proactive defense framework for two emerging threats: (1) production LLM-based speech synthesis, and (2) the novel attack arising from ASR-driven E2E scenarios. Specifically, we employ the encoder ensemble with a feature extractor to protect timbre, while ASR-targeted adversarial examples disrupt pronunciation. Moreover, we incorporate the psychoacoustic model to ensure perturbative imperceptibility. For a comprehensive evaluation, we test 16 open-source synthesizers and 3 commercial APIs across Chinese and English datasets, confirming E2E-VGuard's effectiveness in timbre and pronunciation protection. Real-world deployment validation is also conducted. Our code and demo page are available at https://wxzyd123.github.io/e2e-vguard/.",

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF.",

Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions.

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).",

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generative models often exhibit bias related to sensitive attributes. However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies.",

Configurable LLM pipelines can thus mimic expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.",

    "abstract": "Natural and efficient interaction remains a critical challenge for virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) systems. Vision-based gesture recognition suffers from high computational cost, sensitivity to lighting conditions, and privacy leakage concerns. Acoustic sensing provides an attractive alternative: by emitting inaudible high-frequency signals and capturing their reflections, channel impulse response (CIR) encodes how gestures perturb the acoustic field in a low-cost and user-transparent manner. However, existing CIR-based gesture recognition methods often rely on extensive training of models on large labeled datasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot VR scenarios. In this work, we propose the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for CIR-based gesture recognition in VR/AR systems. Despite LLMs' strengths, it is non-trivial to achieve few-shot and zero-shot learning of CIR gestures due to their inconspicuous features. To tackle this challenge, we collect differential CIR rather than original CIR data. Moreover, we construct a real-world dataset collected from 10 participants performing 15 gestures across three categories (digits, letters, and shapes), with 10 repetitions each. We then conduct extensive experiments on this dataset using an LLM-adopted classifier. Results show that our LLM-based framework achieves accuracy comparable to classical machine learning baselines, while requiring no domain-specific retraining.",

While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The results suggest that LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.",

For Arabic, however, the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets that preserve document structure has limited progress. In this paper, we present our pipeline Wasm for processing the Common Crawl dataset to create a new Arabic multimodal dataset that uniquely provides markdown output. Unlike existing Arabic corpora that focus solely on text extraction, our approach preserves the structural integrity of web content while maintaining flexibility for both text-only and multimodal pre-training scenarios. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of our data processing pipeline against those used for major existing datasets, highlighting the convergences in filtering strategies and justifying our specific design choices.

Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning.",

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.",

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.",

Detecting self-talk is technically challenging due to its diverse acoustic forms, semantic and grammatical incompleteness, and irregular occurrence patterns, which differ fundamentally from assumptions underlying conventional speech understanding models. To address these challenges, MutterMeter employs a hierarchical classification architecture that progressively integrates acoustic, linguistic, and contextual information through a sequential processing pipeline, adaptively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. We build and evaluate MutterMeter using a first-of-its-kind dataset comprising 31.1 hours of audio collected from 25 participants.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its \"portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i) difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.",

On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference.

    "abstract": "Code review is a cornerstone of software quality assurance, and recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in its automation. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations. Lack of semantic context: most benchmarks provide only code diffs without textual information such as issue descriptions, which are crucial for understanding developer intent. Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review. We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries. ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: hunk-level quality assessment, line-level defect localization, and line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability. Deployed at ByteDance, ContextCRBench drives a self-evolving code review system, improving performance by 61.98% and demonstrating its robustness and industrial utility. https://github.com/kinesiatricssxilm14/ContextCRBench.",

This structure effectively extracts salient features not only from historical returns but also from asset-specific and systematic covariates, significantly enhancing the performance of forecasts and portfolios. Experimental results on the daily excess returns of 12 industry portfolios show that Diffolio outperforms various probabilistic forecasting baselines in multivariate forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. Moreover, in portfolio experiments, portfolios constructed from Diffolio's forecasts show consistently robust performance, thereby outperforming those from benchmarks by achieving higher Sharpe ratios for the mean-variance tangency portfolio and higher certainty equivalents for the growth-optimal portfolio. These results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Diffolio in terms of not only statistical accuracy but also economic significance.",

    "abstract": "3D semantic scene understanding remains a long-standing challenge in the 3D computer vision community. One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding. We are convinced that the TrueCity dataset will foster further development of sim-to-real gap quantification and enable generalizable data-driven models. The data, code, and 3D models are available online: https://tum-gis.github.io/TrueCity/",

    "abstract": "Virtual screening (VS) is an essential task in drug discovery, focusing on the identification of small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \\textbf{S}equence information and 3D \\textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in contrastive learning.",

    "abstract": "Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of molecular structures is important for the prediction of molecular ground-state conformation involving property information. Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often under-perform on tabular data due to their sensitivity to irrelevant features and a spectral bias toward smooth, low-frequency functions. These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.",

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have shown strong ability to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly adopted as world models in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability. However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.",

In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance rather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Besides, ALIGN also yields superior explanation quality concerning sufficiency and comprehensiveness, highlighting its effectiveness in producing accurate and interpretable models.",

In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommender systems, offering state-of-the-art performance by modeling the generative process of user-item interactions. However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios.

To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in multimodal reasoning and have shown impressive performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process.

    "abstract": "Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) is critical for the efficient operation of power systems, but extreme condition and market anomalies pose significant challenges to existing forecasting methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) model and an Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM). The DAT leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically assign higher weights to critical segments of historical data, effectively capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Concurrently, the ASM employs unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions, such as heavy rain, heat waves, or human festivals. Experiments on datasets sampled from California and Shandong Province demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our framework thus holds promise for enhancing grid resilience and optimizing market operations in future power systems.",

We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.",

To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: Adaptive Residual Kalman Smoother that operates as a statistically robust estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores.

These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a key challenge in the era of foundation models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning speak to the efficacy of TuckA, offering a new and effective solution to the PEFT problem.",

Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars.

To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background. This framework makes axial super-resolution imaging more accessible by providing an easy-to-deploy algorithm that avoids additional hardware costs and complexity, showing great potential for live cell studies and clinical histopathology.",

In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.",

Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge. Simulation results confirm that our approach maintains high performance while drastically cutting energy costs, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to enable scalable, adaptive, and environmentally conscious RL-based beam selection strategies in dynamic and diverse propagation environments.",

    "abstract": "Product line extension is a strategically important managerial decision that requires anticipating how consumer segments and purchasing contexts may respond to hypothetical product designs that do not yet exist in the market. Such decisions are inherently uncertain because managers must infer future outcomes from historical purchase data without direct market observations. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a data-driven decision support framework that enables forward-looking what-if analysis based on historical transaction data. We introduce a Conditional Tabular Variational Autoencoder (CTVAE) that learns the conditional joint distribution of product attributes and consumer characteristics from large-scale tabular data. By conditioning the generative process on controllable design variables such as container type, volume, flavor, and calorie content, the proposed model generates synthetic consumer attribute distributions for hypothetical line-extended products. This enables systematic exploration of alternative design scenarios without costly market pretests. The framework is evaluated using home-scan panel data covering more than 20,000 consumers and 700 soft drink products. Empirical results show that the CTVAE outperforms existing tabular generative models in capturing conditional consumer attribute distributions. Simulation-based analyses further demonstrate that the generated synthetic data support knowledge-driven reasoning for assessing cannibalization risks and identifying potential target segments. These findings highlight the value of conditional deep generative models as core components of decision support systems for product line extension planning.",

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \\textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \\emph{\\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \\emph{\\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer.

To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input.

    "abstract": "Stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is essential for next-generation navigation and augmented reality. Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively.",

To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \\method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models.

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of urban mobility systems has made traffic simulation indispensable for evidence-based transportation planning and policy evaluation. However, despite the analytical capabilities of platforms such as the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), their application remains largely confined to domain experts. Developing realistic simulation scenarios requires expertise in network construction, origin-destination modeling, and parameter configuration for policy experimentation, creating substantial barriers for non-expert users such as policymakers, urban planners, and city officials. Moreover, the requests expressed by these users are often incomplete and abstract-typically articulated as high-level objectives, which are not well aligned with the imperative, sequential workflows employed in existing language-model-based simulation frameworks. To address these challenges, this study proposes AgentSUMO, an agentic framework for interactive simulation scenario generation via large language models. AgentSUMO departs from imperative, command-driven execution by introducing an adaptive reasoning layer that interprets user intents, assesses task complexity, infers missing parameters, and formulates executable simulation plans. The framework is structured around two complementary components, the Interactive Planning Protocol, which governs reasoning and user interaction, and the Model Context Protocol, which manages standardized communication and orchestration among simulation tools. Through this design, AgentSUMO converts abstract policy objectives into executable simulation scenarios. Experiments on urban networks in Seoul and Manhattan demonstrate that the agentic workflow achieves substantial improvements in traffic flow metrics while maintaining accessibility for non-expert users, successfully bridging the gap between policy goals and executable simulation workflows.",

Existing recommendation unlearning methods, while capable of removing target data influence, suffer from inefficient unlearning speed and degraded performance, failing to meet real-time unlearning demands. Considering the ranking-oriented nature of recommendation systems, we present unranking, the process of reducing the ranking positions of target items while ensuring the formal guarantees of recommendation unlearning. To achieve efficient unranking, we propose Learning to Fast Unrank in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (L2UnRank), which operates through three key stages: (a) identifying the influenced scope via interaction-based p-hop propagation, (b) computing structural and semantic influences for entities within this scope, and (c) performing efficient, ranking-aware parameter updates guided by influence information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate L2UnRank's model-agnostic nature, achieving state-of-the-art unranking effectiveness and maintaining recommendation quality comparable to retraining, while also delivering a 50x speedup over existing methods.

    "abstract": "This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$γ$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $γ\\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor.",

Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.",

Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.",

A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $β$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets.

We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit \"thinking\" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.",

QUARK targets all nonlinear operations within Transformer-based models, achieving high-performance approximation through a novel circuit-sharing design tailored to accelerate these operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that QUARK significantly reduces the computational overhead of nonlinear operators in mainstream Transformer architectures, achieving up to a 1.96 times end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations. Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.",

    "abstract": "Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly being deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet their behavioral robustness to data contamination during instruction tuning remains poorly understood. We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.",

    "abstract": "Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \\textit{What} and \\textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance, thereby confirming its capability to represent essential spatiotemporal relations from the visual stream. Cognitive ablation analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlining a path for a more holistic evaluation. Finally, the white-box nature of SRNN enables precise pinpointing of error root causes. Our work provides a proof-of-concept that confirms the viability of translating key principles of biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding in constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "As large language models continue to develop and expand, the extensive public data they rely on faces the risk of depletion. Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.",

Therefore, Spectral Deconvolution imaging (SDI) methods based on PSF engineering have been proposed to achieve high-fidelity compact CSI design recently. However, the composite convolution-integration operations of SDI render the normal-equation coefficient matrix scene-dependent, which hampers the efficient exploitation of imaging priors and poses challenges for accurate reconstruction. To tackle the inherent data-dependent operators in SDI, we introduce a Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Aggregation Unfolding Framework (HSFAUF). By decomposing subproblems and projecting them into the frequency domain, HSFAUF transforms nonlinear processes into linear mappings, thereby enabling efficient solutions. Furthermore, to integrate spatial-spectral priors during iterative refinement, we propose a Spatial-Frequency Aggregation Transformer (SFAT), which explicitly aggregates information across spatial and frequency domains. By integrating SFAT into HSFAUF, we develop a Transformer-based deep unfolding method, \\textbf{H}ierarchical \\textbf{S}patial-\\textbf{F}requency \\textbf{A}ggregation \\textbf{U}nfolding \\textbf{T}ransformer (HSFAUT), to solve the inverse problem of SDI.

However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this physics-informed goal generation significantly improves the quality of proposed goals, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place scenarios.",

In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized seismic phase picking, yet a paradox persists: high signal-to-noise S-wave predictions consistently fail to cross detection thresholds, oscillating at suppressed amplitudes. We identify this previously unexplained phenomenon as amplitude suppression, which we diagnose through analyzing training histories and loss landscapes. Three interacting factors emerge: S-wave onsets exhibit high temporal uncertainty relative to high-amplitude boundaries; CNN's bias toward sharp amplitude changes anchors predictions to these boundaries rather than subtle onsets; and point-wise Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss lacks lateral corrective forces, providing only vertical gradients that suppress amplitude while temporal gaps persist. This geometric trap points to a shape-then-align solution where stable geometric templates must precede temporal alignment. We implement this through a conditional GAN framework by augmenting conventional BCE training with a discriminator that enforces shape constraints. Training for 10,000 steps, this achieves a 64% increase in effective S-phase detections. Our framework autonomously discovers target geometry without a priori assumptions, offering a generalizable solution for segmentation tasks requiring precise alignment of subtle features near dominant structures.",

In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\\% with 95\\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity. Our holistic methods and findings show that data owners rely on various channels to convey data consent, of which current AI data collection pipelines do not entirely respect. These findings highlight the limitations of the current dataset curation/release practice and the need for a unified data consent framework taking AI purposes into consideration.",

Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \\textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency.

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

    "abstract": "Sequential statistical protocols require meticulous state management and robust error handling -- challenges naturally suited to functional programming. We present a functional architecture for structural enforcement of statistical rigor in automated research systems (AI-Scientists). These LLM-driven systems risk generating spurious discoveries through dynamic hypothesis testing. We introduce the Research monad, a Haskell eDSL that enforces sequential statistical protocols (e.g., Online FDR (false discovery rate) control) using a monad transformer stack. To address risks in hybrid architectures where LLMs generate imperative code, we employ Declarative Scaffolding -- generating rigid harnesses that structurally constrain execution and prevent methodological errors like data leakage. We validate this approach through large-scale simulation (N=2000 hypotheses) and an end-to-end case study, demonstrating essential defense-in-depth for automated science integrity.",

Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.",

    "abstract": "Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.",

The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.\n  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted. Our evaluation covers over 1,900 inference configurations, spanning diverse model architectures, task modalities (text, vision, audio, tabular), hardware types, and precision levels. These rigorous and reliable measurements demonstrate that quantization enhances ESS, huge accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight applications, and even small models may incur significant costs when implemented suboptimally.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences typically requires expensive supervised fine-tuning. Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.",

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Animal Re-ID has recently gained substantial attention in the AI research community due to its high impact on biodiversity monitoring and unique research challenges arising from environmental factors. The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Furthermore, we also show an improvement of 11.09%, 8.2% and 2.06% for unknown individuals in an open-world setting.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios.

Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

    "abstract": "As AI systems become more capable of complex agentic tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to occasionally make factual mistakes, then admit them when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AIs.",

However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.",

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Spatial perception is central to auditory intelligence, enabling accurate understanding of real-world acoustic scenes and advancing human-level perception of the world around us. While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Ingesting data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves either fine-tuning the embedding model directly on the target corpus or parsing documents for embedding model encoding. The former, while accurate, incurs high computational hardware requirements, while the latter suffers from suboptimal performance when extracting tabular data. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG pipeline designed to tackle table-heavy documents via structured language representations. TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing-based methods for generation and retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/jacobyhsi/TabRAG.",

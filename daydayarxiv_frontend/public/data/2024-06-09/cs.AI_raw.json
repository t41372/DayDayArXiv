    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based Semantic Communications (SemCom) is becoming\ncritical to maximize overall efficiency of communication networks.\nNevertheless, SemCom is sensitive to wireless channel uncertainties, source\noutliers, and suffer from poor generalization bottlenecks. To address the\nmentioned challenges, this paper develops a latent diffusion model-enabled\nSemCom system with three key contributions, i.e., i) to handle potential\noutliers in the source data, semantic errors obtained by projected gradient\ndescent based on the vulnerabilities of DL models, are utilized to update the\nparameters and obtain an outlier-robust encoder, ii) a lightweight single-layer\nlatent space transformation adapter completes one-shot learning at the\ntransmitter and is placed before the decoder at the receiver, enabling\nadaptation for out-of-distribution data and enhancing human-perceptual quality,\nand iii) an end-to-end consistency distillation (EECD) strategy is used to\ndistill the diffusion models trained in latent space, enabling deterministic\nsingle or few-step low-latency denoising in various noisy channels while\nmaintaining high semantic quality. Extensive numerical experiments across\ndifferent datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SemCom system,\nconsistently proving its robustness to outliers, the capability to transmit\ndata with unknown distributions, and the ability to perform real-time channel\ndenoising tasks while preserving high human perceptual quality, outperforming\nthe existing denoising approaches in semantic metrics such as multi-scale\nstructural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) and learned perceptual image path\nsimilarity (LPIPS).",

Nonetheless, most existing\ndialogue systems predominantly focus on brief single-session interactions,\nneglecting the real-world demands for long-term companionship and personalized\ninteractions with chatbots. Crucial to addressing this real-world need are\nevent summary and persona management, which enable reasoning for appropriate\nlong-term dialogue responses. Recent progress in the human-like cognitive and\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs suggests that LLM-based agents could\nsignificantly enhance automated perception, decision-making, and\nproblem-solving. In response to this potential, we introduce a model-agnostic\nframework, the Long-term Dialogue Agent (LD-Agent), which incorporates three\nindependently tunable modules dedicated to event perception, persona\nextraction, and response generation. For the event memory module, long and\nshort-term memory banks are employed to separately focus on historical and\nongoing sessions, while a topic-based retrieval mechanism is introduced to\nenhance the accuracy of memory retrieval. Furthermore, the persona module\nconducts dynamic persona modeling for both users and agents. The integration of\nretrieved memories and extracted personas is subsequently fed into the\ngenerator to induce appropriate responses. The effectiveness, generality, and\ncross-domain capabilities of LD-Agent are empirically demonstrated across\nvarious illustrative benchmarks, models, and tasks.

Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the\nperformance of MLLMs and humans on II-Bench. The pinnacle accuracy of MLLMs\nattains 74.8%, whereas human accuracy averages 90%, peaking at an impressive\n98%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on abstract and complex images,\nsuggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and\ncapture image details. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit\nenhanced accuracy when image sentiment polarity hints are incorporated into the\nprompts. This observation underscores a notable deficiency in their inherent\nunderstanding of image sentiment. We believe that II-Bench will inspire the\ncommunity to develop the next generation of MLLMs, advancing the journey\ntowards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI). II-Bench is publicly\navailable at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/II-Bench.",

Also, tissues like Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\n(DCIS), acini, etc. are often classified as Tumors due to their structural\nsimilarities and color compositions. In this paper, we proposed a novel\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) based Multi-class Tissue Segmentation model\nfor histopathology whole-slide Breast slides which classify tumors and segments\nother tissue regions such as Ducts, acini, DCIS, Squamous epithelium, Blood\nVessels, Necrosis, etc. as a separate class.

Our proposed\nmodel is also able to separate bad regions such as folds, artifacts, blurry\nregions, bubbles, etc. from tissue regions using multi-level context from\ndifferent resolutions of WSI. Multi-phase iterative training with context-aware\naugmentation and increasing noise was used to efficiently train a multi-stain\ngeneric model with partial and noisy annotations from 513 slides. Our training\npipeline used 12 million patches generated using context-aware augmentations\nwhich made our model stain and scanner invariant across data sources. To\nextrapolate stain and scanner invariance, our model was evaluated on 23000\npatches which were for a completely new stain (Hematoxylin and Eosin) from a\ncompletely new scanner (Motic) from a different lab. The mean IOU was 0.72\nwhich is on par with model performance on other data sources and scanners.",

    "abstract": "Conducting experiments to estimate total effects can be challenging due to\ncost, ethical concerns, or practical limitations. As an alternative,\nresearchers often rely on causal graphs to determine if it is possible to\nidentify these effects from observational data. Identifying total effects in\nfully specified non-temporal causal graphs has garnered considerable attention,\nwith Pearl's front-door criterion enabling the identification of total effects\nin the presence of latent confounding even when no variable set is sufficient\nfor adjustment. However, specifying a complete causal graph is challenging in\nmany domains. Extending these identifiability results to partially specified\ngraphs is crucial, particularly in dynamic systems where causal relationships\nevolve over time. This paper addresses the challenge of identifying total\neffects using a specific and well-known partially specified graph in dynamic\nsystems called a summary causal graph, which does not specify the temporal lag\nbetween causal relations and can contain cycles. In particular, this paper\npresents sufficient graphical conditions for identifying total effects from\nobservational data, even in the presence of hidden confounding and when no\nvariable set is sufficient for adjustment, contributing to the ongoing effort\nto understand and estimate causal effects from observational data using summary\ncausal graphs.",

However, existing approaches face notable limitations,\nparticularly in their neglect of three-dimensional (3D) information, which is\ncrucial for understanding molecular structures and functions. While some\nefforts have been made to incorporate 3D molecular information into LMs using\nexternal structure encoding modules, significant difficulties remain, such as\ninsufficient interaction across modalities in pre-training and challenges in\nmodality alignment. To address the limitations, we propose \\textbf{3D-MolT5}, a\nunified framework designed to model molecule in both sequence and 3D structure\nspaces. The key innovation of our approach lies in mapping fine-grained 3D\nsubstructure representations into a specialized 3D token vocabulary. This\nmethodology facilitates the seamless integration of sequence and structure\nrepresentations in a tokenized format, enabling 3D-MolT5 to encode molecular\nsequences, molecular structures, and text sequences within a unified\narchitecture. Leveraging this tokenized input strategy, we build a foundation\nmodel that unifies the sequence and structure data formats. We then conduct\njoint pre-training with multi-task objectives to enhance the model's\ncomprehension of these diverse modalities within a shared representation space.\nThus, our approach significantly improves cross-modal interaction and\nalignment, addressing key challenges in previous work.

    "abstract": "Distilling latent diffusion models (LDMs) into ones that are fast to sample\nfrom is attracting growing research interest. However, the majority of existing\nmethods face two critical challenges: (1) They hinge on long training using a\nhuge volume of real data. (2) They routinely lead to quality degradation for\ngeneration, especially in text-image alignment. This paper proposes a novel\ntraining-efficient Latent Consistency Model (TLCM) to overcome these\nchallenges. Our method first accelerates LDMs via data-free multistep latent\nconsistency distillation (MLCD), and then data-free latent consistency\ndistillation is proposed to efficiently guarantee the inter-segment consistency\nin MLCD. Furthermore, we introduce bags of techniques, e.g., distribution\nmatching, adversarial learning, and preference learning, to enhance TLCM's\nperformance at few-step inference without any real data. TLCM demonstrates a\nhigh level of flexibility by enabling adjustment of sampling steps within the\nrange of 2 to 8 while still producing competitive outputs compared to full-step\napproaches. Notably, TLCM enjoys the data-free merit by employing synthetic\ndata from the teacher for distillation. With just 70 training hours on an A100\nGPU, a 3-step TLCM distilled from SDXL achieves an impressive CLIP Score of\n33.68 and an Aesthetic Score of 5.97 on the MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark,\nsurpassing various accelerated models and even outperforming the teacher model\nin human preference metrics. We also demonstrate the versatility of TLCMs in\napplications including image style transfer, controllable generation, and\nChinese-to-image generation.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion breaks through the boundaries between diverse modalities\nand has already achieved notable performances. However, in many specialized\nfields, it is struggling to obtain sufficient alignment data for training,\nwhich seriously limits the use of previously effective models. Therefore,\nsemi-supervised learning approaches are attempted to facilitate multimodal\nalignment by learning from low-alignment data with fewer matched pairs, but\ntraditional techniques like pseudo-labeling may run into troubles in the\nlabel-deficient scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we reframe\nsemi-supervised multimodal alignment as a manifold matching issue and propose a\nnew methodology based on CLIP, termed Set-CLIP. Specifically, by designing a\nnovel semantic density distribution loss, we constrain the latent\nrepresentation distribution with fine granularity and extract implicit semantic\nalignment from unpaired multimodal data, thereby reducing the reliance on\nnumerous strictly matched pairs. Furthermore, we apply coarse-grained modality\nadaptation and unimodal self-supervised guidance to narrow the gaps between\nmodality spaces and improve the stability of representation distributions.\nExtensive experiments conducted on a range of tasks in various fields,\nincluding protein analysis, remote sensing, and the general vision-language\nfield, validate the efficacy of our proposed Set-CLIP method. Especially with\nno paired data for supervised training, Set-CLIP is still outstanding, which\nbrings an improvement of 144.83% over CLIP.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the sensitivity analysis of a Bayesian network studies the\nimpact of individually modifying the entries of its conditional probability\ntables in a one-at-a-time (OAT) fashion. However, this approach fails to give a\ncomprehensive account of each inputs' relevance, since simultaneous\nperturbations in two or more parameters often entail higher-order effects that\ncannot be captured by an OAT analysis. We propose to conduct global\nvariance-based sensitivity analysis instead, whereby $n$ parameters are viewed\nas uncertain at once and their importance is assessed jointly. Our method works\nby encoding the uncertainties as $n$ additional variables of the network. To\nprevent the curse of dimensionality while adding these dimensions, we use\nlow-rank tensor decomposition to break down the new potentials into smaller\nfactors. Last, we apply the method of Sobol to the resulting network to obtain\n$n$ global sensitivity indices. Using a benchmark array of both expert-elicited\nand learned Bayesian networks, we demonstrate that the Sobol indices can\nsignificantly differ from the OAT indices, thus revealing the true influence of\nuncertain parameters and their interactions.",

    "abstract": "Conditional Neural Fields (CNFs) are increasingly being leveraged as\ncontinuous signal representations, by associating each data-sample with a\nlatent variable that conditions a shared backbone Neural Field (NeF) to\nreconstruct the sample. However, existing CNF architectures face limitations\nwhen using this latent downstream in tasks requiring fine-grained geometric\nreasoning, such as classification and segmentation. We posit that this results\nfrom lack of explicit modelling of geometric information (e.g., locality in the\nsignal or the orientation of a feature) in the latent space of CNFs. As such,\nwe propose Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs), a novel CNF architecture which\nuses a geometry-informed cross-attention to condition the NeF on a geometric\nvariable--a latent point cloud of features--that enables an equivariant\ndecoding from latent to field. We show that this approach induces a\nsteerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry\nand amenable to transformation laws: if the field transforms, the latent\nrepresentation transforms accordingly--and vice versa. Crucially, this\nequivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing\ngeometric patterns faithfully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent\nspace, and (2) weight-sharing over similar local patterns, allowing for\nefficient learning of datasets of fields. We validate these main properties in\na range of tasks including classification, segmentation, forecasting,\nreconstruction and generative modelling, showing clear improvement over\nbaselines with a geometry-free latent space.

We show the identification properties of our compositional model,\ninspired by advances in causal matrix factorization methods.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based singing voice conversion (SVC) models have shown better\nsynthesis quality compared to traditional methods. However, in cross-domain SVC\nscenarios, where there is a significant disparity in pitch between the source\nand target voice domains, the models tend to generate audios with hoarseness,\nposing challenges in achieving high-quality vocal outputs. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a Self-supervised Pitch Augmentation method for Singing Voice\nConversion (SPA-SVC), which can enhance the voice quality in SVC tasks without\nrequiring additional data or increasing model parameters. We innovatively\nintroduce a cycle pitch shifting training strategy and Structural Similarity\nIndex (SSIM) loss into our SVC model, effectively enhancing its performance.\nExperimental results on the public singing datasets M4Singer indicate that our\nproposed method significantly improves model performance in both general SVC\nscenarios and particularly in cross-domain SVC scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of\nhuman creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines,\nenhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many\napplications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to\nmulti-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only\non reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid\nsolutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning\nquality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of\npossible solutions. Reward-maximization reinforcement learning aims to find\nlimited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To\nfill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient\ndiversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality\nand diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a\nMarkovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us\nto incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to\nsample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized)\nreward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited\ntraining examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse,\ncreative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of\nexisting inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks,\nincluding BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving),\nRubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math\nreasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

    "abstract": "2D irregular packing is a classic combinatorial optimization problem with\nvarious applications, such as material utilization and texture atlas\ngeneration. This NP-hard problem requires efficient algorithms to optimize\nspace utilization. Conventional numerical methods suffer from slow convergence\nand high computational cost. Existing learning-based methods, such as the\nscore-based diffusion model, also have limitations, such as no rotation\nsupport, frequent collisions, and poor adaptability to arbitrary boundaries,\nand slow inferring. The difficulty of learning from teacher packing is to\ncapture the complex geometric relationships among packing examples, which\ninclude the spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their\ngeometric features, and container boundary conditions. Representing these\nrelationships in latent space is challenging. We propose GFPack++, an\nattention-based gradient field learning approach that addresses this challenge.\nIt consists of two pivotal strategies: \\emph{attention-based geometry encoding}\nfor effective feature encoding and \\emph{attention-based relation encoding} for\nlearning complex relationships. We investigate the utilization distribution\nbetween the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to\nprioritize tighter teacher data during training, enhancing learning\neffectiveness. Our diffusion model supports continuous rotation and outperforms\nexisting methods on various datasets. We achieve higher space utilization over\nseveral widely used baselines, one-order faster than the previous\ndiffusion-based method, and promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\nWe plan to release our source code and datasets to support further research in\nthis direction.",

However, different from\nthe orthogonal projection in the traditional CNN architecture, the prompt\ngradient orthogonal projection in the ViT architecture shows completely\ndifferent and greater challenges, i.e., 1) the high-order and non-linear\nself-attention operation; 2) the drift of prompt distribution brought by the\nLayerNorm in the transformer block.

Second, in order to\nimprove geometry reconstruction and enable supervision at full image\nresolution, we extract meshes from the NeRF field in a differentiable manner\nand fine-tune the NeRF model through mesh rendering.

In this paper, we employ weak classifiers to explain\nLLM safety through the intermediate hidden states. We first confirm that LLMs\nlearn ethical concepts during pre-training rather than alignment and can\nidentify malicious and normal inputs in the early layers.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in language\nunderstanding and generation tasks by leveraging vast amounts of online texts.\nUnlike conventional models, LLMs can adapt to new domains through prompt\nengineering without the need for retraining, making them suitable for various\nbusiness functions, such as strategic planning, project implementation, and\ndata-driven decision-making. However, their limitations in terms of bias,\ncontextual understanding, and sensitivity to prompts raise concerns about their\nreadiness for real-world applications. This paper thoroughly examines the\nusefulness and readiness of LLMs for business processes. The limitations and\ncapacities of LLMs are evaluated through experiments conducted on four\naccessible LLMs using real-world data. The findings have significant\nimplications for organizations seeking to leverage generative AI and provide\nvaluable insights into future research directions. To the best of our\nknowledge, this represents the first quantified study of LLMs applied to core\nbusiness operations and challenges.",

    "abstract": "The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into architectural\ndesign has witnessed a significant evolution, marked by the recent advancements\nin AI to generate text, images, and 3D models. However, no models exist for\ntext-to-parametric models that are used in architectural design for generating\nvarious design options, including free-form designs, and optimizing the design\noptions. This study creates and investigates an innovative application of\ngenerative AI in parametric modeling by leveraging a customized Text-to-Visual\nProgramming (Text2VP) GPT derived from GPT-4. The primary focus is on\nautomating the generation of graph-based visual programming workflows,\nincluding parameters and the links among the parameters, through AI-generated\nscripts, accurately reflecting users' design intentions and allowing the users\nto change the parameter values interactively. The Text2VP GPT customization\nprocess utilizes detailed and complete documentation of the visual programming\nlanguage components, example-driven few-shot learning, and specific\ninstructional guides. Our testing demonstrates Text2VP's capability to generate\nworking parametric models. The paper also discusses the limitations of Text2VP;\nfor example, more complex parametric model generation introduces higher error\nrates. This research highlights the potential of generative AI in visual\nprogramming and parametric modeling and sets a foundation for future\nenhancements to handle more sophisticated and intricate modeling tasks\neffectively. The study aims to allow designers to create and change design\nmodels without significant effort in learning a specific programming language\nsuch as Grasshopper.",

    "abstract": "In contemporary computer vision applications, particularly image\nclassification, architectural backbones pre-trained on large datasets like\nImageNet are commonly employed as feature extractors. Despite the widespread\nuse of these pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there remains a\ngap in understanding the performance of various resource-efficient backbones\nacross diverse domains and dataset sizes. Our study systematically evaluates\nmultiple lightweight, pre-trained CNN backbones under consistent training\nsettings across a variety of datasets, including natural images, medical\nimages, galaxy images, and remote sensing images. This comprehensive analysis\naims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable\nbackbone for their specific problem, especially in scenarios involving small\ndatasets where fine-tuning a pre-trained network is crucial. Even though\nattention-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observed that they\ntend to perform poorly under low data finetuning tasks compared to CNNs. We\nalso observed that some CNN architectures such as ConvNeXt, RegNet and\nEfficientNet performs well compared to others on a diverse set of domains\nconsistently. Our findings provide actionable insights into the performance\ntrade-offs and effectiveness of different backbones, facilitating informed\ndecision-making in model selection for a broad spectrum of computer vision\ndomains.

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease characterized by optic neuropathy, leading\nto irreversible vision loss. It progresses gradually, often remaining\nundiagnosed until advanced stages. Early detection is crucial to monitor\natrophy and develop treatment strategies to prevent further vision impairment.\nData-centric methods have enabled computer-aided algorithms for precise\nglaucoma diagnosis.\n  In this study, we use deep learning models to identify complex disease traits\nand progression criteria, detecting subtle changes indicative of glaucoma. We\nexplore the structure-function relationship in glaucoma progression and predict\nfunctional impairment from structural eye deterioration. We analyze statistical\nand machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques with optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT) scans for accurate progression prediction.\n  Addressing challenges like age variability, data imbalances, and noisy\nlabels, we develop novel semi-supervised time-series algorithms:\n  1. Weakly-Supervised Time-Series Learning: We create a CNN-LSTM model to\nencode spatiotemporal features from OCT scans. This approach uses age-related\nprogression and positive-unlabeled data to establish robust pseudo-progression\ncriteria, bypassing gold-standard labels.\n  2. Semi-Supervised Time-Series Learning: Using labels from Guided Progression\nAnalysis (GPA) in a contrastive learning scheme, the CNN-LSTM architecture\nlearns from potentially mislabeled data to improve prediction accuracy.\n  Our methods outperform conventional and state-of-the-art techniques.",

This system provides natural language\nguidance about how students can improve their incorrect solutions to short\nprogramming exercises. A hint can be requested each time a student fails a test\ncase. Our evaluation addresses three Research Questions:\n  RQ1: Do the hints help students improve their code? RQ2: How effectively do\nthe hints capture problems in student code? RQ3: Are the issues that students\nresolve the same as the issues addressed in the hints?\n  To address these research questions quantitatively, we identified a set of\nfine-grained knowledge components and determined which ones apply to each\nexercise, incorrect solution, and generated hint. Comparing data from two large\nCS1 offerings, we found that access to the hints helps students to address\nproblems with their code more quickly, that hints are able to consistently\ncapture the most pressing errors in students' code, and that hints that address\na few issues at once rather than a single bug are more likely to lead to direct\nstudent progress.",

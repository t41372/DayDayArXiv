Watermarking is considered to be an alternative to safeguard the\ncopyright of generative models and prevent their misuse. However, in the\ncontext of model distribution scenarios, the accessibility of models to large\nscale of model users brings new challenges to the security, efficiency and\nrobustness of existing watermark solutions. To address these issues, we propose\na secure and efficient watermarking solution. A new security mechanism is\ndesigned to prevent watermark leakage and watermark escape, which considers\nwatermark randomness and watermark-model association as two constraints for\nmandatory watermark injection. To reduce the time cost of training the security\nmodule, watermark injection and the security mechanism are decoupled, ensuring\nthat fine-tuning VAE only accomplishes the security mechanism without the\nburden of learning watermark patterns. A watermark distribution-based\nverification strategy is proposed to enhance the robustness against diverse\nattacks in the model distribution scenarios. Experimental results prove that\nour watermarking consistently outperforms existing six baselines on\neffectiveness and robustness against ten image processing attacks and\nadversarial attacks, while enhancing security in the distribution scenarios.",

Despite their\nempirical success, our theoretical understanding of KGFMs remains very limited.\nIn this paper, we conduct a rigorous study of the expressive power of KGFMs.\nSpecifically, we show that the expressive power of KGFMs directly depends on\nthe motifs that are used to learn the relation representations. We then observe\nthat the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the\nrepresentations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which\nlimits the model's expressiveness. As part of our study, we design more\nexpressive KGFMs using richer motifs, which necessitate learning relation\nrepresentations based on, e.g., how triples of relations interact with each\nother. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings, showing that\nthe use of richer motifs results in better performance on a wide range of\ndatasets drawn from different domains.",

Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) systems,\nenabled by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a promising\nsolution for assessing and providing instant feedback for open-ended student\nresponses.

On the other hand, o1-preview, despite\nhigher accuracy, exhibits a larger variance in error that makes it less\npractical for classroom use. We investigate the effects of incorporating\ninstructor-graded examples into prompts using no examples, random selection,\nand Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based selection strategies.

However, are there times when we can infer how the\nmodel will behave (e.g. abstain from answering a question) early in the\ncomputation, making generation unnecessary? We show that internal\nrepresentation of input tokens alone can often precisely predict, not just the\nnext token, but eventual behavior over the entire output sequence. We leverage\nthis capacity and learn probes on internal states to create early warning (and\nexit) systems. Specifically, if the probes can confidently estimate the way the\nLM is going to behave, then the system will avoid generating tokens altogether\nand return the estimated behavior instead. On 27 text classification datasets\nspanning five different tasks, we apply this method to estimate the eventual\nanswer of an LM under CoT prompting, reducing inference costs by 65% (average)\nwhile suffering an accuracy loss of no more than 1.4% (worst case). We\ndemonstrate the potential of this method to pre-emptively identify when a model\nwill abstain from answering a question, fail to follow output format\nspecifications, or give a low-confidence response. We explore the limits of\nthis capability, showing that probes generalize to unseen datasets, but perform\nworse when LM outputs are longer and struggle to predict properties that\nrequire access to knowledge that the models themselves lack.

A number of recent works in privacy research have\nattempted to mitigate privacy risks posed by memorizing fine-tuning data by\nusing differentially private training methods (e.g., DP), albeit at a\nsignificantly higher computational cost (inefficiency). In parallel, several\nworks in systems research have focussed on developing (parameter) efficient\nfine-tuning methods (e.g., LoRA), but few works, if any, investigated whether\nsuch efficient methods enhance or diminish privacy risks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this gap and arrive at a surprising conclusion: efficient\nfine-tuning methods like LoRA mitigate privacy risks similar to private\nfine-tuning methods like DP. Our empirical finding directly contradicts\nprevailing wisdom that privacy and efficiency objectives are at odds during\nfine-tuning. Our finding is established by (a) carefully defining measures of\nprivacy and utility that distinguish between memorizing sensitive and\nnon-sensitive tokens in training and test datasets used in fine-tuning and (b)\nextensive evaluations using multiple open-source language models from Pythia,\nGemma, and Llama families and different domain-specific datasets.",

To address the above limitations, we\npropose a new NLU annotation guideline based on individual-level factors.\nSpecifically, we incorporate other posts by the same individual and then\nannotate individual subjective perspectives after considering all individual\nposts. We use this guideline to expand and re-annotate the stance detection and\ntopic-based sentiment analysis datasets. We find that error rates in the\nsamples were as high as 31.7\\% and 23.3\\%. We further use large language models\nto conduct experiments on the re-annotation datasets and find that the large\nlanguage models perform well on both datasets after adding individual factors.\nBoth GPT-4o and Llama3-70B can achieve an accuracy greater than 87\\% on the\nre-annotation datasets. We also verify the effectiveness of individual factors\nthrough ablation studies. We call on future researchers to add individual\nfactors when creating such datasets.

However, previous research\nshows that LS can force feature representations into excessively tight\nclusters, eroding intra-class distinctions. More recent findings suggest that\nLS also induces overconfidence in misclassifications, yet the precise mechanism\nremained unclear. In this work, we decompose the loss term introduced by LS,\nrevealing two key components: (i) a regularization term that functions only\nwhen the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-enhancement term that emerges\nunder misclassifications. This latter term compels the model to reinforce\nincorrect predictions with exaggerated certainty, further collapsing the\nfeature space. To address these issues, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup),\nwhich uniformly applies the intended regularization to both correct and\nincorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit instead of the ground-truth\nlogit. Through feature analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class\nvariation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Extensive experiments on image\nclassification and downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust\nalternative to LS.

Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC)\nusing the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become\na promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum\ntrade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches\npartition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying\ncentralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the\npursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no\ncommunication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we\npropose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic\nstates among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among\nintersections. We first justify the evolution equation of the RTSC process is\nMarkovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the\nevolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication\nmodules--GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region\ncorrelations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only\nconsiders the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the\nlane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then\naggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks--RegionLight and\nRegional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug\neffectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real\nand synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and\npotential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.",

      "abstract": "Investigating value alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) based on\ncultural context has become a critical area of research. However, similar\nbiases have not been extensively explored in large vision-language models\n(VLMs). As the scale of multimodal models continues to grow, it becomes\nincreasingly important to assess whether images can serve as reliable proxies\nfor culture and how these values are embedded through the integration of both\nvisual and textual data. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of\nmultimodal model at different scales, focusing on their alignment with cultural\nvalues. Our findings reveal that, much like LLMs, VLMs exhibit sensitivity to\ncultural values, but their performance in aligning with these values is highly\ncontext-dependent. While VLMs show potential in improving value understanding\nthrough the use of images, this alignment varies significantly across contexts\nhighlighting the complexities and underexplored challenges in the alignment of\nmultimodal models.",

To address these challenges, we introduce a new\nvariant of the strategic classification framework tailored to manipulations\nperformed using large language models, accommodating varying levels of\nmanipulations and stochastic outcomes. We propose a ``two-ticket'' scheme,\nwhere the hiring algorithm applies an additional manipulation to each submitted\nresume and considers this manipulated version together with the original\nsubmitted resume. We establish theoretical guarantees for this scheme, showing\nimprovements for both the fairness and accuracy of hiring decisions when the\ntrue positive rate is maximized subject to a no false positives constraint. We\nfurther generalize this approach to an $n$-ticket scheme and prove that hiring\noutcomes converge to a fixed, group-independent decision, eliminating\ndisparities arising from differential LLM access.

While recent advances have\nenhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional\nrelationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object\norientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations.\nAddressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an\nexpressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we\npropose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than\ncanonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following\nrobotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic\norientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a\nreference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the\n''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K,\na large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that\nlink geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic\norientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation\nactions with both positional and orientational constraints.

Expert recommendations may contradict data-driven results, and\ntheir reliability can vary significantly depending on the domain or specific\nquery. Existing methods based on soft constraints or inconsistencies in\npredicted causal relationships fail to account for these variations in\nexpertise. To remedy this, we propose L2D-CD, a method for gauging the\ncorrectness of expert recommendations and optimally combining them with\ndata-driven causal discovery results. By adapting learning-to-defer (L2D)\nalgorithms for pairwise causal discovery (CD), we learn a deferral function\nthat selects whether to rely on classical causal discovery methods using\nnumerical data or expert recommendations based on textual meta-data. We\nevaluate L2D-CD on the canonical T\\\"ubingen pairs dataset and demonstrate its\nsuperior performance compared to both the causal discovery method and the\nexpert used in isolation. Moreover, our approach identifies domains where the\nexpert's performance is strong or weak.

In this paper, we introduce\nDecomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human\npreferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations.\nOur key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them\nusing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

These\ndecomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs,\noffering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward\nmodels. We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference\ndimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without\nadditional training.

Magma is a significant extension of\nvision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding\nability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the\nability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal\nintelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot\nmanipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large\namounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics\ndata, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in\nimages are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object\nmovements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are\nlabeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show\nthat SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of\nspatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a\nwide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new\nstate-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks,\noutperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On\nimage and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to\npopular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets.

Existing approaches often employ multi-stage generation procedures,\nresulting in cumbersome training and inference pipelines. In this paper, we\npropose SongGen, a fully open-source, single-stage auto-regressive transformer\ndesigned for controllable song generation. The proposed model facilitates\nfine-grained control over diverse musical attributes, including lyrics and\ntextual descriptions of instrumentation, genre, mood, and timbre, while also\noffering an optional three-second reference clip for voice cloning. Within a\nunified auto-regressive framework, SongGen supports two output modes: mixed\nmode, which generates a mixture of vocals and accompaniment directly, and\ndual-track mode, which synthesizes them separately for greater flexibility in\ndownstream applications. We explore diverse token pattern strategies for each\nmode, leading to notable improvements and valuable insights. Furthermore, we\ndesign an automated data preprocessing pipeline with effective quality control.\nTo foster community engagement and future research, we will release our model\nweights, training code, annotated data, and preprocessing pipeline.

Given that commercial LLMs are gaining an\nincreasingly strong foothold in everyday applications, it is crucial to examine\nwhether LLMs in fact interpret gender-inclusive language neutrally, because the\nlanguage they generate has the potential to influence the language of their\nusers. This study examines whether LLM-generated coreferent terms align with a\ngiven gender expression or reflect model biases. Adapting psycholinguistic\nmethods from French to English and German, we find that in English, LLMs\ngenerally maintain the antecedent's gender but exhibit underlying masculine\nbias.

      "abstract": "Clinical Question Answering (CQA) plays a crucial role in medical\ndecision-making, enabling physicians to extract relevant information from\nElectronic Medical Records (EMRs). While transformer-based models such as BERT,\nBioBERT, and ClinicalBERT have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in\nCQA, existing models lack the ability to categorize extracted answers, which is\ncritical for structured retrieval, content filtering, and medical decision\nsupport.\n  To address this limitation, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL)\nframework that jointly trains CQA models for both answer extraction and medical\ncategorization. In addition to predicting answer spans, our model classifies\nresponses into five standardized medical categories: Diagnosis, Medication,\nSymptoms, Procedure, and Lab Reports. This categorization enables more\nstructured and interpretable outputs, making clinical QA models more useful in\nreal-world healthcare settings.\n  We evaluate our approach on emrQA, a large-scale dataset for medical question\nanswering. Results show that MTL improves F1-score by 2.2% compared to standard\nfine-tuning, while achieving 90.7% accuracy in answer categorization. These\nfindings suggest that MTL not only enhances CQA performance but also introduces\nan effective mechanism for categorization and structured medical information\nretrieval.",

To bridge this gap, we propose BOLIMES, a novel\nfeature selection algorithm designed to enhance gene expression classification\nby systematically refining the feature subset. Unlike conventional methods that\nrely solely on statistical ranking or classifier-specific selection, we\nintegrate the robustness of Boruta with the interpretability of LIME, ensuring\nthat only the most relevant and influential genes are retained. BOLIMES first\nemploys Boruta to filter out non-informative genes by comparing each feature\nagainst its randomized counterpart, thus preserving valuable information. It\nthen uses LIME to rank the remaining genes based on their local importance to\nthe classifier. Finally, an iterative classification evaluation determines the\noptimal feature subset by selecting the number of genes that maximizes\npredictive accuracy. By combining exhaustive feature selection with\ninterpretability-driven refinement, our solution effectively balances\ndimensionality reduction with high classification performance, offering a\npowerful solution for high-dimensional gene expression analysis.",

      "abstract": "AI systems increasingly support human decision-making. In many cases, despite\nthe algorithm's superior performance, the final decision remains in human\nhands. For example, an AI may assist doctors in determining which diagnostic\ntests to run, but the doctor ultimately makes the diagnosis. This paper studies\nsuch AI-assisted decision-making settings, where the human learns through\nrepeated interactions with the algorithm. In our framework, the algorithm --\ndesigned to maximize decision accuracy according to its own model -- determines\nwhich features the human can consider. The human then makes a prediction based\non their own less accurate model. We observe that the discrepancy between the\nalgorithm's model and the human's model creates a fundamental tradeoff. Should\nthe algorithm prioritize recommending more informative features, encouraging\nthe human to recognize their importance, even if it results in less accurate\npredictions in the short term until learning occurs? Or is it preferable to\nforgo educating the human and instead select features that align more closely\nwith their existing understanding, minimizing the immediate cost of learning?\nThis tradeoff is shaped by the algorithm's time-discounted objective and the\nhuman's learning ability. Our results show that optimal feature selection has a\nsurprisingly clean combinatorial characterization, reducible to a stationary\nsequence of feature subsets that is tractable to compute. As the algorithm\nbecomes more \"patient\" or the human's learning improves, the algorithm\nincreasingly selects more informative features, enhancing both prediction\naccuracy and the human's understanding.

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot\ninference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware\ndetection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android\napplications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits\nand obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural\ncomplexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs'\nsequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious\nintent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical\ncontext-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD\nintegrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and\nconstruct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze\napplication behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level\nsemantics, providing final prediction and explanation.

Structural equation modeling assessed both direct and indirect\neffects, including potential quadratic relationships. Results revealed that\ntrust plays a pivotal mediating role: ease of use exerts a significant indirect\neffect on usage intentions through trust, while perceived usefulness\ncontributes to both trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk\nperception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of\nrobust data governance and transparency. Notably, significant non-linear paths\nwere observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau\neffects.

      "abstract": "We present an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively\nstructures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph\nconstruction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our\napproach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually\nupdated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new\nconcepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates\nsubsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this\nfeedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network\ncharacterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link\ndisparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges\ncontinue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest\npath distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our\nanalysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub'\nconcepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic,\nself-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge\nstructures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional\nreasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles\nto foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that\ntranscend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for\nopen-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific\ndiscovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and\ninterpretability.",

However,\ndespite this enormous potential, most present-day data systems that leverage\nLLMs are reactive, reflecting our community's desire to map LLMs to known\nabstractions. Most data systems treat LLMs as an opaque black box that operates\non user inputs and data as is, optimizing them much like any other approximate,\nexpensive UDFs, in conjunction with other relational operators. Such data\nsystems do as they are told, but fail to understand and leverage what the LLM\nis being asked to do (i.e. the underlying operations, which may be\nerror-prone), the data the LLM is operating on (e.g., long, complex documents),\nor what the user really needs. They don't take advantage of the characteristics\nof the operations and/or the data at hand, or ensure correctness of results\nwhen there are imprecisions and ambiguities. We argue that data systems instead\nneed to be proactive: they need to be given more agency -- armed with the power\nof LLMs -- to understand and rework the user inputs and the data and to make\ndecisions on how the operations and the data should be represented and\nprocessed. By allowing the data system to parse, rewrite, and decompose user\ninputs and data, or to interact with the user in ways that go beyond the\nstandard single-shot query-result paradigm, the data system is able to address\nuser needs more efficiently and effectively. These new capabilities lead to a\nrich design space where the data system takes more initiative: they are\nempowered to perform optimization based on the transformation operations, data\ncharacteristics, and user intent. We discuss various successful examples of how\nthis framework has been and can be applied in real-world tasks, and present\nfuture directions for this ambitious research agenda.",

To address this, this paper introduces HOMIE, a semi-autonomous\nteleoperation system that combines a reinforcement learning policy for body\ncontrol mapped to a pedal, an isomorphic exoskeleton arm for arm control, and\nmotion-sensing gloves for hand control, forming a unified cockpit to freely\noperate humanoids and establish a data flywheel. The policy incorporates novel\ndesigns, including an upper-body pose curriculum, a height-tracking reward, and\nsymmetry utilization. These features enable the system to perform walking and\nsquatting to specific heights while seamlessly adapting to arbitrary upper-body\nposes. The exoskeleton, by eliminating the reliance on inverse dynamics,\ndelivers faster and more precise arm control. The gloves utilize Hall sensors\ninstead of servos, allowing even compact devices to achieve 15 or more degrees\nof freedom and freely adapt to any model of dexterous hands. Compared to\nprevious teleoperation systems, HOMIE stands out for its exceptional\nefficiency, completing tasks in half the time; its expanded working range,\nallowing users to freely reach high and low areas as well as interact with any\nobjects; and its affordability, with a price of just $500.

Algorithms for learning domain models exist, yet it remains\nunclear whether learning a domain model and planning is an effective approach\nfor numeric planning environments, i.e., where states include discrete and\nnumeric state variables. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning a\nnumeric domain model and compare it with alternative model-free solutions. As a\ncase study, we use two tasks in Minecraft, a popular sandbox game that has been\nused as an AI challenge. First, we consider an offline learning setting, where\na set of expert trajectories are available to learn from. This is the standard\nsetting for learning domain models. We used the Numeric Safe Action Model\nLearning (NSAM) algorithm to learn a numeric domain model and solve new\nproblems with the learned domain model and a numeric planner. We call this\nmodel-based solution NSAM_(+p), and compare it to several model-free Imitation\nLearning (IL) and Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Empirical\nresults show that some IL algorithms can learn faster to solve simple tasks,\nwhile NSAM_(+p) allows solving tasks that require long-term planning and\nenables generalizing to solve problems in larger environments. Then, we\nconsider an online learning setting, where learning is done by moving an agent\nin the environment. For this setting, we introduce RAMP. In RAMP, observations\ncollected during the agent's execution are used to simultaneously train an RL\npolicy and learn a planning domain action model. This forms a positive feedback\nloop between the RL policy and the learned domain model. We demonstrate\nexperimentally the benefits of using RAMP, showing that it finds more efficient\nplans and solves more problems than several RL baselines.",

In practice, engineering\nworkflows require structured, part-aware representations, as objects are\ninherently designed as assemblies of distinct components. However, most\nexisting methods either model shapes holistically or decompose them without\npredefined part structures, limiting their applicability in real-world design\ntasks. We propose PartSDF, a supervised implicit representation framework that\nexplicitly models composite shapes with independent, controllable parts while\nmaintaining shape consistency. Despite its simple single-decoder architecture,\nPartSDF outperforms both supervised and unsupervised baselines in\nreconstruction and generation tasks. We further demonstrate its effectiveness\nas a structured shape prior for engineering applications, enabling precise\ncontrol over individual components while preserving overall coherence.

Applied to FJSP, L-RHO accelerates RHO by up to 54% while\nsignificantly improving solution quality, outperforming other heuristic and\nlearning-based baselines. We also provide in-depth discussions and verify the\ndesirable adaptability and generalization of L-RHO across numerous FJSP\nvariates, distributions, online scenarios and benchmark instances.

While\nexisting research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program\ninterpreters, search engines, weather/map apps), the necessity of using these\ntools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This\nnaive approach raises two key issues:(1) increased delays due to unnecessary\ntool calls, and (2) potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with\nexternal tools.

We improve performance\nthrough the use of synthetic data augmentation, by systematically creating scar\nimages and associated text. In addition, we standardize the orientation of the\nimages in an anatomy-informed way to enable better alignment of spatial and\ntext features. We also use a captioning loss to enable fine-grained supervision\nand explore the effect of pretraining of the vision encoder on performance.\nFinally, ablation studies are carried out to elucidate the contributions of\neach design component to the overall performance of the model.",

However, their high memory requirements prevent their use in\nresource-constrained environments. While knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\nproven method for model compression, its application to MoE teacher models\nremains underexplored. Through our investigation, we discover that\nnon-activated experts in MoE models possess valuable knowledge that benefits\nstudent models. We further demonstrate that existing KD methods are not optimal\nfor compressing MoE models, as they fail to leverage this knowledge\neffectively. To address this, we propose two intuitive MoE-specific KD methods\nfor the first time: Knowledge Augmentation (KA) and Student-Aware Router (SAR),\nboth designed to effectively extract knowledge from all experts. Specifically,\nKA augments knowledge by sampling experts multiple times, while SAR uses all\nexperts and adjusts the expert weights through router training to provide\noptimal knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our methods outperform\nconventional KD methods, demonstrating their effectiveness for MoE teacher\nmodels.",

These improvements have however resulted in a considerable\nincrease both in size and complexity of these models. Along the environmental\nconcerns this issue raises, this prevents the deployment of such networks on\nconsumer-level devices, and precludes their use for real-time applications.\nMoreover, this appears contradictory with the specificity of the tasks for\nwhich these models are used, which are often simpler compared to extracting a\nrich, multi-purpose representation from any type of audio data. In this paper,\nwe address this issue with a simple, yet effective method to extract\nlightweight specialist subnetworks from large foundation models.

When training the end-to-end model on a downstream task,\nwe add a sparsity-inducing loss to the overall objective, hence learning a\ncompact subnetwork specialized on a single task.

      "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been explored and verified to be\neffective in solving decision-making tasks in various domains, such as\nrobotics, transportation, recommender systems, etc. It learns from the\ninteraction with environments and updates the policy using the collected\nexperience. However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable\nconsequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly\nrestricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning\nbut introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus\ncausing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to\nsolve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques,\nespecially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or\nlanguage models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to\nthe best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the\nsim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State,\nAction, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive\nliterature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the\nsim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the\nspecialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real\nproblems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real\nperformance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and\nopportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this\ndirection. We are actively maintaining a repository to include the most\nup-to-date sim-to-real research work to help domain researchers.",

This study investigates\nwhether advanced conversational capabilities powered by large language models\n(LLMs) can mitigate this effect in highly anthropomorphic robots. We conducted\na user study with 80 participants interacting with Nadine, a hyper-realistic\nhumanoid robot equipped with LLM-driven communication skills. Through pre- and\npost-interaction surveys, we assessed changes in perceptions of uncanniness,\nconversational quality, and overall user experience. Our findings reveal that\nLLM-enhanced interactions significantly reduce feelings of eeriness while\nfostering more natural and engaging conversations. Additionally, we identify\nkey factors influencing user acceptance, including conversational naturalness,\nhuman-likeness, and interestingness. Based on these insights, we propose design\nrecommendations to enhance the appeal and acceptability of hyper-realistic\nrobots in social contexts.

Thus the underlying foundation model should be\neventually replaced by new ones, which leads to repeated cost of fine-tuning\nthese new models. Existing work addresses this problem by inference-time\ntuning, i.e., modifying the output probabilities from the new foundation model\nwith the outputs from the old foundation model and its fine-tuned model, which\ninvolves an additional overhead in inference by the latter two models. In this\npaper, we propose a new fine-tuning principle, Portable Reward Tuning (PRT),\nthat reduces the inference overhead by its nature, based on the reformulation\nof fine-tuning as the reward maximization. Specifically, instead of fine-tuning\nparameters of the foundation models, PRT trains the reward model explicitly\nthrough the same loss function as in fine-tuning. During inference, the reward\nmodel can be used with any foundation model (with the same set of vocabularies\nor labels) through the formulation of reward maximization. Experimental\nresults, covering both vision and language models, demonstrate that the\nPRT-trained model can achieve comparable accuracy to the existing work of\ninference-time tuning, with less inference cost.",

Despite LLMs becoming increasingly\nmultilingual, the vast majority of research on detecting and quantifying LLM\nhallucination are (a) English-centric and (b) focus on machine translation (MT)\nand summarization, tasks that are less common ``in the wild'' than open\ninformation seeking. In contrast, we aim to quantify the extent of LLM\nhallucination across languages in knowledge-intensive long-form question\nanswering. To this end, we train a multilingual hallucination detection model\nand conduct a large-scale study across 30 languages and 6 open-source LLM\nfamilies. We start from an English hallucination detection dataset and rely on\nMT to generate (noisy) training data in other languages. We also manually\nannotate gold data for five high-resource languages; we then demonstrate, for\nthese languages, that the estimates of hallucination rates are similar between\nsilver (LLM-generated) and gold test sets, validating the use of silver data\nfor estimating hallucination rates for other languages. For the final rates\nestimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with\nLLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references.

      "abstract": "Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without\nadditional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing\nframeworks still suffer two practical drawbacks: they must be re-tuned whenever\nthe KG or reasoning task changes, and they depend on a single, high-capacity\nLLM for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, we introduce\nR2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two\nroles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor\n(a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient\nfor LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy.\nAdditionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only\nwhen sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances\nreliability. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks show that R2-KG\nconsistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless\nof the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments\nreveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict\nself-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline\nreliability with reduced inference cost but increased abstention rate in\ncomplex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective\nsolution for KG-based reasoning, reducing reliance on high-capacity LLMs while\nensuring trustworthy inference. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ekrxjwh2009/R2-KG/.",

Typical\nRAG approaches split the text database into chunks, organizing them in a flat\nstructure for efficient searches. To better capture the inherent dependencies\nand structured relationships across the text database, researchers propose to\norganize textual information into an indexing graph, known asgraph-based RAG.\nHowever, we argue that the limitation of current graph-based RAG methods lies\nin the redundancy of the retrieved information, rather than its insufficiency.\nMoreover, previous methods use a flat structure to organize retrieved\ninformation within the prompts, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose PathRAG, which retrieves key relational paths\nfrom the indexing graph, and converts these paths into textual form for\nprompting LLMs. Specifically, PathRAG effectively reduces redundant information\nwith flow-based pruning, while guiding LLMs to generate more logical and\ncoherent responses with path-based prompting.

A common solution is to adopt cloud resolving models, that provide\nmore accurate results than the standard subgrid parametrisation schemes\ntypically used in GCMs. However, cloud resolving models, also referred to as\nsuper paramtetrizations, remain computationally prohibitive. Hybrid modeling,\nwhich integrates deep learning with equation-based GCMs, offers a promising\nalternative but often struggles with long-term stability and accuracy issues.\nIn this work, we find that water vapor oversaturation during condensation is a\nkey factor compromising the stability of hybrid models.

Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by\nan LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as\ndigital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside\ntext in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques,\nsuch as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or\ncannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any\nbyte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is\nimplemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language,\nwhich is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By\nsubstituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode\nwhitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover\ntext without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a\nspecified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression,\nencryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison\non a dataset of 1000000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results\ndemonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various\napplications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans.

      "abstract": "Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life.\nAnalyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep\nquality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians\nare time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have\nenhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale\nlabeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid\nself-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG)\ndata. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive\nlearning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities,\nincluding electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG),\nelectromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the\nmodel to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a\ntemporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture\ncontextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks:\nsleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with\naccuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated\nrobust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited\nlabels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks.\nThese results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for\nthe comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates\ncomprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared\nto other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep\ndisorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.",

A promising route to simplifying TinyML is through\nautomatic machine learning (AutoML), which can distill elaborate optimization\nworkflows into accessible key decisions. Notably, Hardware Aware Neural\nArchitecture Searches - where a computer searches for an optimal TinyML model\nbased on predictive performance and hardware metrics - have gained significant\ntraction, producing some of today's most widely used TinyML models.\nNevertheless, limiting optimization solely to neural network architectures can\nprove insufficient.

While much\nresearch has focused on various linguistic abilities of AI, little attention\nhas been given to how it defines neologisms formed through different word\nformation processes. This study addresses this gap by examining the degree of\nagreement between human and AI-generated responses in defining three types of\nGreek neologisms: blends, compounds, and derivatives. The study employed an\nonline experiment in which human participants selected the most appropriate\ndefinitions for neologisms, while ChatGPT received identical prompts.

However, when considering the\nmajority response among humans, agreement with AI was high for blends and\nderivatives. These findings highlight the complexity of human language and the\nchallenges AI still faces in capturing its nuances.

Several existing sub 2-bit\npost-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by\nleveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient\nweights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore\nthe real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called\nPTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with\nnegligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the\nperspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate\ncorresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels\nbinarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is\nthen presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into\naccount. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization\nmethodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization\npreprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the\npretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in\nper-channel extremely low-bit PTQ.

The challenge is to schedule the\narriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized.\nThere are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which\nare based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although\ntraditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a\nproblem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability\naltogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nframework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures\nto address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A\ngraph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial\nrelationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture\ndesigned to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a\nrunway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while\nmaintaining safety constraints.

Extractive UIE\ncan achieve strong performance using a relatively small model, making it widely\nadopted. Extractive UIEs generally rely on task instructions for different\ntasks, including single-target instructions and multiple-target instructions.\nSingle-target instruction UIE enables the extraction of only one type of\nrelation at a time, limiting its ability to model correlations between\nrelations and thus restricting its capability to extract complex relations.\nWhile multiple-target instruction UIE allows for the extraction of multiple\nrelations simultaneously, the inclusion of irrelevant relations introduces\ndecision complexity and impacts extraction accuracy. Therefore, for\nmulti-relation extraction, we propose LDNet, which incorporates multi-aspect\nrelation modeling and a label drop mechanism. By assigning different relations\nto different levels for understanding and decision-making, we reduce decision\nconfusion. Additionally, the label drop mechanism effectively mitigates the\nimpact of irrelevant relations. Experiments show that LDNet outperforms or\nachieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art systems on 9 tasks, 33\ndatasets, in both single-modal and multi-modal, few-shot and zero-shot\nsettings.\\footnote{https://github.com/Lu-Yang666/LDNet}",

In addition,\nexisting algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off\namong model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these\nconfusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly,\nin order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for\nexisting mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies\n(e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct\nextensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with\nvarious sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1),\narchitectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and\nVILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluation metrics.Through comparative analysis on\nthe results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and\nmodelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our\nbenchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding\ncross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models\nshould be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical\ncombination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various\nrobustness.

Although some recent\nmethods solve this problem by controlling the updates of latent states, they\ncannot disentangle the long/short-term states, leading to the inability to\neffectively adapt to nonstationary. To tackle this challenge, we propose a\ngeneral framework to disentangle long/short-term states for online time series\nforecasting. Our idea is inspired by the observations where short-term changes\ncan be led by unknown interventions like abrupt policies in the stock market.\nBased on this insight, we formalize a data generation process with unknown\ninterventions on short-term states. Under mild assumptions, we further leverage\nthe independence of short-term states led by unknown interventions to establish\nthe identification theory to achieve the disentanglement of long/short-term\nstates.

Beyond the methods used to solve these problems, the structure and\nformulation of the problems themselves also play a crucial role in determining\nthe performance of large language models. We observe that even small changes in\nthe surface form of mathematical problems can have a profound impact on both\nthe answer distribution and solve rate.

      "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) demonstrates the advantage of aligning a\nlarge language model with human preference using only an offline dataset.\nHowever, DPO has the limitation that the KL penalty, which prevents excessive\ndeviation from the reference model, is static throughout the training process.\nSeveral methods claim to change this static KL penalty of DPO into a dynamic\none, but no approach can adaptively assign different KL penalties for each\npreference pair. In this paper, we propose $\\varepsilon$-Direct Preference\nOptimization ($\\varepsilon$-DPO), which allows adaptive control of the KL\npenalty strength $\\beta$ for each preference pair. Specifically,\n$\\varepsilon$-DPO adaptively controls $\\beta$ for each preference pair based on\nthe monotonicity of logits as a preference model under the perturbation of\n$\\beta$ during training. This is equivalent to adjusting the KL penalty by\nchecking whether the change in training-time temperature can lead to better\npreference confidence as preference models by simply reusing the logit of the\ncurrent policy and the reference policy. Experimental results show that the\nsimple criterion of $\\varepsilon$-DPO for KL penalty relaxation significantly\nimproves DPO compared to most existing direct alignment algorithms on general\nchatbot benchmarks and reveal that this KL penalty control criterion can\nreflect confusion as a preference model and provide an efficient KL trade-off,\nhighlighting the significance of instance-level adaptive KL penalty control in\nDPO.",

Detecting grooming\ninstances in an online conversation poses a significant challenge as the\ninteractions are not necessarily sexually explicit, since the predators take\ntime to build trust and a relationship with their victim. Moreover, predators\nevade detection using indirect and coded language. While previous studies have\nfine-tuned Transformers to automatically identify grooming in chat\nconversations, they overlook the impact of coded and indirect language on model\npredictions, and how these align with human perceptions of grooming. In this\npaper, we address this gap and evaluate bi-encoders on the task of classifying\ndifferent degrees of grooming risk in chat contexts, for three different\nparticipant groups, i.e. law enforcement officers, real victims, and decoys.\nUsing a fuzzy-theoretic framework, we map human assessments of grooming\nbehaviors to estimate the actual degree of grooming risk. Our analysis reveals\nthat fine-tuned models fail to tag instances where the predator uses indirect\nspeech pathways and coded language to evade detection. Further, we find that\nsuch instances are characterized by a higher presence of out-of-vocabulary\n(OOV) words in samples, causing the model to misclassify.

This\nchallenge is unsurprising, as successful human writing, according to the\nCognitive Writing Theory, is a complex cognitive process involving iterative\nplanning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. Motivated by these cognitive\nprinciples, we aim to equip LLMs with human-like cognitive writing capabilities\nthrough CogWriter, a novel training-free framework that transforms LLM\nconstrained long-form text generation into a systematic cognitive writing\nparadigm. Our framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Planning Agent that\nperforms hierarchical planning to decompose the task, and (2) multiple\nGeneration Agents that execute these plans in parallel. The system maintains\nquality via continuous monitoring and reviewing mechanisms, which evaluate\noutputs against specified requirements and trigger necessary revisions.\nCogWriter demonstrates exceptional performance on LongGenBench, a benchmark for\ncomplex constrained long-form text generation. Even when using Qwen-2.5-14B as\nits backbone, CogWriter surpasses GPT-4o by 22% in complex instruction\ncompletion accuracy while reliably generating texts exceeding 10,000 words. We\nhope this cognitive science-inspired approach provides a paradigm for LLM\nwriting advancements:\n\\href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/CogWriter}{CogWriter}.",

While the \"personification\" enhances human\nexperiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to\ncritical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment\nand toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different\npersonality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs.\nLeveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social\npsychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs'\nperformance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the\nsensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more\nimportantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and\ntoxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several\npersonality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model\nperformance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and\ntoxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content\nsafety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM\npersonification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of\npersonalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text\ngeneration.",

To address this\nchallenge, we propose MomentSeeker, a novel benchmark for long-video moment\nretrieval (LMVR), distinguished by the following features. First, it is created\nbased on long and diverse videos, averaging over 1200 seconds in duration and\ncollected from various domains, e.g., movie, anomaly, egocentric, and sports.\nSecond, it covers a variety of real-world scenarios in three levels:\nglobal-level, event-level, object-level, covering common tasks like action\nrecognition, object localization, and causal reasoning, etc. Third, it\nincorporates rich forms of queries, including text-only queries,\nimage-conditioned queries, and video-conditioned queries. On top of\nMomentSeeker, we conduct comprehensive experiments for both generation-based\napproaches (directly using MLLMs) and retrieval-based approaches (leveraging\nvideo retrievers).

Our iterative process\ninvolves progressively increasing the observation period from two weeks to\ntwelve weeks, allowing us to examine the effects of different temporal windows\non the model's performance. This window expansion is implemented in two\nsettings.

      "abstract": "Embodied Question Answering (EQA) has primarily focused on indoor\nenvironments, leaving the complexities of urban settings-spanning environment,\naction, and perception-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nCityEQA, a new task where an embodied agent answers open-vocabulary questions\nthrough active exploration in dynamic city spaces. To support this task, we\npresent CityEQA-EC, the first benchmark dataset featuring 1,412 human-annotated\ntasks across six categories, grounded in a realistic 3D urban simulator.\nMoreover, we propose Planner-Manager-Actor (PMA), a novel agent tailored for\nCityEQA. PMA enables long-horizon planning and hierarchical task execution: the\nPlanner breaks down the question answering into sub-tasks, the Manager\nmaintains an object-centric cognitive map for spatial reasoning during the\nprocess control, and the specialized Actors handle navigation, exploration, and\ncollection sub-tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PMA achieves 60.7% of\nhuman-level answering accuracy, significantly outperforming competitive\nbaselines. While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights\nthe need for enhanced visual reasoning in CityEQA. This work paves the way for\nfuture advancements in urban spatial intelligence.

      "abstract": "Embodied AI systems, including robots and autonomous vehicles, are\nincreasingly integrated into real-world applications, where they encounter a\nrange of vulnerabilities stemming from both environmental and system-level\nfactors. These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial\nattacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant\nchallenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research,\nexisting reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security\nchallenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI\nvulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified\nframework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1)\ncategorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g.,\nphysical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures,\nsoftware flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack\nparadigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception,\ndecision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors\ntargeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs)\nwithin embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction\nmisinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for\nembodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing\ntargeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI\nsystems.

We evaluate PHIER in the\nCALVIN and BEHAVIOR robotic environments and show that PHIER significantly\noutperforms existing methods in few-shot, out-of-distribution state\nclassification, and demonstrates strong zero- and few-shot generalization from\nsimulated to real-world tasks.

Extensive experiments on three benchmarks and\nfive LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of MCTS-Judge, which improves the base\nmodel's accuracy from 41% to 80%, surpassing the o1-series models with 3x fewer\ntokens.

Despite high benchmark scores, LLMs exhibit significant\naccuracy drops and unexpected biases (e.g., preference for longer distractors)\nwhen faced with these minor but content-preserving modifications. For example,\nQwen 2.5 1.5B's MMLU score rises from 60 to 89 and drops from 89 to 36 when\noption lengths are changed without altering the question.

In this paper, we analyze the\nrecently proposed equivariant OT flows that learn permutation invariant\ngenerative models for point-based molecular data and we show that these models\nscale poorly on large point clouds. Also, we observe learning (equivariant) OT\nflows is generally challenging since straightening flow trajectories makes the\nlearned flow model complex at the beginning of the trajectory.

Examples of such tools include large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. As the\nperformance of various leading GenAI models approaches saturation due to\nsimilar training data sources and neural network architecture designs, the\ndevelopment of reliable safety guardrails has become a key differentiator for\nresponsibility and sustainability. This paper presents a formalization of the\nconcept of computational safety, which is a mathematical framework that enables\nthe quantitative assessment, formulation, and study of safety challenges in\nGenAI through the lens of signal processing theory and methods. In particular,\nwe explore two exemplary categories of computational safety challenges in GenAI\nthat can be formulated as hypothesis testing problems. For the safety of model\ninput, we show how sensitivity analysis and loss landscape analysis can be used\nto detect malicious prompts with jailbreak attempts. For the safety of model\noutput, we elucidate how statistical signal processing and adversarial learning\ncan be used to detect AI-generated content.

Recently, Deep Neural Network-driven Color Constancy (DNNCC) models\nhave made substantial advancements. Nevertheless, the potential risks in DNNCC\ndue to the vulnerability of deep neural networks have not yet been explored. In\nthis paper, we conduct the first investigation into the impact of a key factor\nin color constancy-brightness-on DNNCC from a robustness perspective. Our\nevaluation reveals that several mainstream DNNCC models exhibit high\nsensitivity to brightness despite their focus on chromaticity estimation. This\nsheds light on a potential limitation of existing DNNCC models: their\nsensitivity to brightness may hinder performance given the widespread\nbrightness variations in real-world datasets. From the insights of our\nanalysis, we propose a simple yet effective brightness robustness enhancement\nstrategy for DNNCC models, termed BRE. The core of BRE is built upon the\nadaptive step-size adversarial brightness augmentation technique, which\nidentifies high-risk brightness variation and generates augmented images via\nexplicit brightness adjustment. Subsequently, BRE develops a\nbrightness-robustness-aware model optimization strategy that integrates\nadversarial brightness training and brightness contrastive loss, significantly\nbolstering the brightness robustness of DNNCC models. BRE is\nhyperparameter-free and can be integrated into existing DNNCC models, without\nincurring additional overhead during the testing phase. Experiments on two\npublic color constancy datasets-ColorChecker and Cube+-demonstrate that the\nproposed BRE consistently enhances the illuminant estimation performance of\nexisting DNNCC models, reducing the estimation error by an average of 5.04%\nacross six mainstream DNNCC models, underscoring the critical role of enhancing\nbrightness robustness in these models.",

      "abstract": "We propose a new approach that enables end users to directly solve the cold\nstart problem by themselves. The cold start problem is a common issue in\nrecommender systems, and many methods have been proposed to address the problem\non the service provider's side. However, when the service provider does not\ntake action, users are left with poor recommendations and no means to improve\ntheir experience. We propose an algorithm, Pretender, that allows end users to\nproactively solve the cold start problem on their own. Pretender does not\nrequire any special support from the service provider and can be deployed\nindependently by users. We formulate the problem as minimizing the distance\nbetween the source and target distributions and optimize item selection from\nthe target service accordingly. Furthermore, we establish theoretical\nguarantees for Pretender based on a discrete quadrature problem. We conduct\nexperiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPretender.",

      "abstract": "Although 85% of sub-Saharan Africa's population is covered by mobile\nbroadband signal, only 37% use the internet, and those who do seldom use the\nweb. The most frequently cited reason for low internet usage is the cost of\ndata. We investigate whether AI can bridge this gap by analyzing 40,350 queries\nsubmitted to an AI chatbot by 469 teachers in Sierra Leone over 17 months.\nTeachers use AI for teaching assistance more frequently than web search. We\ncompare the AI responses to the corresponding top search results for the same\nqueries from the most popular local web search engine, google.com.sl. Only 2%\nof results for corresponding web searches contain content from in country.\nAdditionally, the average web search result consumes 3,107 times more data than\nan AI response. Bandwidth alone costs \\$2.41 per thousand web search results\nloaded, while the total cost of AI is \\$0.30 per thousand responses. As a\nresult, AI is 87% less expensive than web search. In blinded evaluations, an\nindependent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and\ncorrect than web search results. These findings suggest that AI-driven\nsolutions can cost-effectively bridge information gaps in low-connectivity\nregions.",

For\nexample, in analyzing the effects of Christmas on retail sales, we lack direct\nobservation of what would have occurred in late December without the Christmas\nimpact. To address this, we try to recover the control group in the event\nperiod while accounting for confounders and temporal dependencies. Experimental\nresults on the M5 Walmart retail sales data demonstrate robust estimation of\nthe potential outcome of the control group as well as accurate predicted\nholiday effect. Furthermore, we provided theoretical guarantees for the\nestimated treatment effect, proving its consistency and asymptotic normality.\nThe proposed methodology is applicable not only to this always-missing control\nscenario but also in other conventional time series causal inference settings.",

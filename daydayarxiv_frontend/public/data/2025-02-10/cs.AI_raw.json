    "abstract": "Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets\nfrom diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a\ntime-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying\nterminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper\npresents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower\nexperts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce\nHarmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user\ninterface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the\nsynthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a\nclinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create\nreusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss\nchallenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our\nvision.",

A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the\nKey-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces\nmemory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache\nconstraints theoretically and propose a novel batching and scheduling algorithm\nthat minimizes inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's\nmemory.\n  More specifically, we make the following contributions. First, to evaluate\nthe performance of online algorithms for scheduling in LLM inference, we\nintroduce a hindsight optimal benchmark, formulated as an integer program that\ncomputes the minimum total inference latency under full future information.\nSecond, we prove that no deterministic online algorithm can achieve a constant\ncompetitive ratio when the arrival process is arbitrary. Third, motivated by\nthe computational intractability of solving the integer program at scale, we\npropose a polynomial-time online scheduling algorithm and show that under\ncertain conditions it can achieve a constant competitive ratio. We also\ndemonstrate our algorithm's strong empirical performance by comparing it to the\nhindsight optimal in a synthetic dataset. Finally, we conduct empirical\nevaluations on a real-world public LLM inference dataset, simulating the\nLlama2-70B model on A100 GPUs, and show that our algorithm significantly\noutperforms the benchmark algorithms.

LLMs are notoriously vulnerable to biases in their dataset,\nleading to issues such as toxicity. While domain-adaptive training has been\nemployed to mitigate these issues, these techniques often address all model\nparameters indiscriminately during the repair process, resulting in poor repair\nquality and reduced model versatility. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ndynamic slicing-based intent-aware LLM repair strategy, IRepair. This approach\nselectively targets the most error-prone sections of the model for repair.\nSpecifically, we propose dynamically slicing the model's most sensitive layers\nthat require immediate attention, concentrating repair efforts on those areas.\nThis method enables more effective repairs with potentially less impact on the\nmodel's overall performance by altering a smaller portion of the model. We\nevaluated our technique on three models from the GPT2 and GPT-Neo families,\nwith parameters ranging from 800M to 1.6B, in a toxicity mitigation setup. Our\nresults show that IRepair repairs errors 43.6% more effectively while causing\n46% less disruption to general performance compared to the closest baseline,\ndirect preference optimization. Our empirical analysis also reveals that errors\nare more concentrated in a smaller section of the model, with the top 20% of\nlayers exhibiting 773% more error density than the remaining 80\\%. This\nhighlights the need for selective repair. Additionally, we demonstrate that a\ndynamic selection approach is essential for addressing errors dispersed\nthroughout the model, ensuring a robust and efficient repair.",

Modeling allophones is crucial for atypical\npronunciation assessment, which involves distinguishing atypical from typical\npronunciations. However, recent phoneme classifier-based approaches often\nsimplify this by treating various realizations as a single phoneme, bypassing\nthe complexity of modeling allophonic variation. Motivated by the acoustic\nmodeling capabilities of frozen self-supervised speech model (S3M) features, we\npropose MixGoP, a novel approach that leverages Gaussian mixture models to\nmodel phoneme distributions with multiple subclusters. Our experiments show\nthat MixGoP achieves state-of-the-art performance across four out of five\ndatasets, including dysarthric and non-native speech. Our analysis further\nsuggests that S3M features capture allophonic variation more effectively than\nMFCCs and Mel spectrograms, highlighting the benefits of integrating MixGoP\nwith S3M features.",

When a collaborator's understanding\ndiverges from the current state -- what we term the out-of-sync challenge --\nthe collaborator's actions may fail, leading to integration issues. In this\nwork, we introduce SyncMind, a framework that systematically defines the\nout-of-sync problem faced by large language model (LLM) agents in collaborative\nsoftware engineering (CSE). Based on SyncMind, we create SyncBench, a benchmark\nfeaturing 24,332 instances of agent out-of-sync scenarios in real-world CSE\nderived from 21 popular GitHub repositories with executable verification tests.\nExperiments on SyncBench uncover critical insights into existing LLM agents'\ncapabilities and limitations.

However, quantizing models -- especially to\nlow precisions like int4 or int2 -- requires a trade-off in model quality;\nint2, in particular, is known to severely degrade model quality. Consequently,\npractitioners are often forced to maintain multiple models with different\nquantization levels or serve a single model that best satisfies the\nquality-latency trade-off. On the other hand, integer data types, such as int8,\ninherently possess a nested (Matryoshka) structure where smaller bit-width\nintegers, like int4 or int2, are nested within the most significant bits.\nLeveraging this insight, in this paper, we propose Matryoshka Quantization\n(MatQuant), a novel multi-scale quantization technique that alleviates the\naforementioned challenge. This technique allows us to train and maintain a\nsingle quantized model but serve it with the precision demanded by the\ndeployment. Furthermore, leveraging MatQuant's co-training and co-distillation\nregularization, int2 precision models extracted by MatQuant outperform standard\nint2 quantization by up to to 4% and 7% with OmniQuant and QAT as base\nalgorithms respectively.

Building\nupon these atomic routes, RelGNN designs new composite message passing\nmechanisms between heterogeneous nodes, allowing direct single-hop interactions\nbetween them. This approach avoids redundant aggregations and mitigates\ninformation entanglement, ultimately leading to more efficient and accurate\npredictive modeling. RelGNN is evaluated on 30 diverse real-world tasks from\nRelBench (Fey et al., 2024), and consistently achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy with up to 25% improvement.",

Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged\nas a popular solution to improve training efficiency and reduce storage needs\nby tuning additional low-rank modules within pre-trained backbones.

To address these issues,\nwe introduce an innovative Multi-Kernel Kronecker Adaptation with Re-Scaling\nTransmission (KARST) for various recognition tasks.

Besides, it incorporates extra\nlearnable re-scaling factors to better align with pre-trained feature\ndistributions, allowing for more flexible and balanced feature aggregation.\nExtensive experiments validate that our KARST outperforms other PEFT\ncounterparts with a negligible inference cost due to its re-parameterization\ncharacteristics.

    "abstract": "Recent AI advancements, such as OpenAI's new models, are transforming LLMs\ninto LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) that perform reasoning during inference,\ntaking extra time and compute for higher-quality outputs. We aim to uncover the\nalgorithmic framework for training LRMs. Methods like self-consistency, PRM,\nand AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search. We ask: what is the simplest,\nmost scalable way to enable search in LLMs?\n  We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via\nSelf-Play (RLSP). RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with\nhuman or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an\nexploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning\nbehaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness\nwhile preventing reward hacking. Our key innovation is to decouple exploration\nand correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to\nimprove performance and efficiency.\n  Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. On\nthe Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500\ntest set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due\nto RLSP. However, a more important finding of this work is that the models\ntrained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages\nthe model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors\nsuch as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification. These findings\ndemonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex\nreasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled. Lastly, we propose a theory as to why\nRLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result\nthat says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as\nthe number of steps in CoT \\cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.",

Graph Neural Networks (GNN)-based methods have shown\nhigh potential in analyzing graph-structured data for this problem. However, a\nmajor limitation in conventional GNN architectures is their inability to\neffectively utilize information from neighbors beyond the network's layer\ndepth, which can reduce the model's accuracy and effectiveness. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel model called Neighborhood-Order Learning Graph Attention\nNetwork (NOL-GAT) for fake news detection. This model allows each node in each\nlayer to independently learn its optimal neighborhood order. By doing so, the\nmodel can purposefully and efficiently extract critical information from\ndistant neighbors. The NOL-GAT architecture consists of two main components: a\nHop Network that determines the optimal neighborhood order and an Embedding\nNetwork that updates node embeddings using these optimal neighborhoods. To\nevaluate the model's performance, experiments are conducted on various fake\nnews datasets. Results demonstrate that NOL-GAT significantly outperforms\nbaseline models in metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, particularly in\nscenarios with limited labeled data. Features such as mitigating the\nover-squashing problem, improving information flow, and reducing computational\ncomplexity further highlight the advantages of the proposed model.",

Traditional models, primarily based on past\nseismicity and geomechanical data, struggle to capture the complexity of\nseismic patterns and often overlook valuable non-seismic precursors such as\ngeophysical, geochemical, and atmospheric anomalies. The integration of such\ndiverse data sources into forecasting models, combined with advancements in AI\ntechnologies, offers a promising path forward. AI methods, particularly deep\nlearning, excel at processing complex, large-scale datasets, identifying subtle\npatterns, and handling multidimensional relationships, making them well-suited\nfor overcoming the limitations of conventional approaches.\n  This review highlights the importance of combining AI with geophysical\nknowledge to create robust, physics-informed forecasting models. It explores\ncurrent AI methods, input data types, loss functions, and practical\nconsiderations for model development, offering guidance to both geophysicists\nand AI researchers. While many AI-based studies oversimplify earthquake\nprediction, neglecting critical features such as data imbalance and\nspatio-temporal clustering, the integration of specialized geophysical insights\ninto AI models can address these shortcomings.\n  We emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, urging\ngeophysicists to experiment with AI architectures thoughtfully and encouraging\nAI experts to deepen their understanding of seismology.

We show that our procedure can\nproduce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that\nSWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms,\nproviding a deeper understanding of its design.

However, current training paradigms treat all samples equally,\noverlooking the importance or relevance of individual samples throughout the\ntraining process. Existing reweighting strategies, which primarily focus on\ngroup-level data importance, fail to leverage fine-grained instance-level\ninformation and do not adapt dynamically to individual sample importance as\ntraining progresses. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic,\ninstance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and\neffectiveness of LLM pretraining.

In particular, our framework allows us to\nsystematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or\nuninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a\nnew theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on\nthe convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal\ncharacterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We\nempirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining\n7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear\nregression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can\nlead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance.",

Here, we propose employing a hybrid sharded\ndata parallel training strategy, FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully shard model\nparameters locally between different accelerators, while inter-node\ncommunication bandwidth requirements are reduced by synchronizing only\nfast-moving components instead of the full gradients. This effectively combines\nprevious hybrid sharded strategies with the advantages of decoupled momentum.\nOur experimental results show that FlexDeMo is on par with hybrid sharded data\nparallel training employing AdamW and full gradient synchronization in terms of\nvalidation loss, demonstrating its viability. Furthermore, FlexDeMo achieves\nimproved training speed compared to full gradient synchronization across nodes.\nIn a bandwidth-constrained 2-node setup, FlexDeMo allows reaching desired\nlevels of validation loss faster than hybrid sharded data parallel training\nwith full gradient synchronization.",

    "abstract": "State-Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to\ntransformers for sequential data tasks, offering linear or near-linear\nscalability with sequence length, making them ideal for long-sequence\napplications in NLP, vision, and edge AI, including real-time transcription,\ntranslation, and contextual search. These applications require lightweight,\nhigh-performance models for deployment on resource-constrained devices like\nlaptops and PCs. Designing specialized accelerators for every emerging neural\nnetwork is costly and impractical; instead, optimizing models for existing NPUs\nin AI PCs provides a scalable solution. To this end, we propose XAMBA, the\nfirst framework to enable and optimize SSMs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) NPUs. XAMBA follows a three-step methodology: (1)\nenabling SSMs on NPUs, (2) optimizing performance to meet KPI requirements, and\n(3) trading accuracy for additional performance gains. After enabling SSMs on\nNPUs, XAMBA mitigates key bottlenecks using CumBA and ReduBA, replacing\nsequential CumSum and ReduceSum operations with matrix-based computations,\nsignificantly improving execution speed and memory efficiency. Additionally,\nActiBA enhances performance by approximating expensive activation functions\n(e.g., Swish, Softplus) using piecewise linear mappings, reducing latency with\nminimal accuracy loss. Evaluations on an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 AI PC show\nthat XAMBA achieves up to 4.8X speed-up over the baseline. Our implementation\nis available at https://github.com/arghadippurdue/XAMBA.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of powerful AI systems has highlighted the need for\nrobust risk management frameworks in the AI industry. Although companies have\nbegun to implement safety frameworks, current approaches often lack the\nsystematic rigor found in other high-risk industries. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive risk management framework for the development of frontier AI that\nbridges this gap by integrating established risk management principles with\nemerging AI-specific practices. The framework consists of four key components:\n(1) risk identification (through literature review, open-ended red-teaming, and\nrisk modeling), (2) risk analysis and evaluation using quantitative metrics and\nclearly defined thresholds, (3) risk treatment through mitigation measures such\nas containment, deployment controls, and assurance processes, and (4) risk\ngovernance establishing clear organizational structures and accountability.\nDrawing from best practices in mature industries such as aviation or nuclear\npower, while accounting for AI's unique challenges, this framework provides AI\ndevelopers with actionable guidelines for implementing robust risk management.\nThe paper details how each component should be implemented throughout the\nlife-cycle of the AI system - from planning through deployment - and emphasizes\nthe importance and feasibility of conducting risk management work prior to the\nfinal training run to minimize the burden associated with it.",

We\nempirically evaluate our combination strategies against standalone KBS and LBS\nfine-tuned on a real-world dataset.

To optimize the effectiveness\nof the waste detector, extensive experiments evaluate such design choices as\nthe network architecture, the ground resolution and geographic span of the\ninput images, as well as the pretraining procedures. The best model attains\nremarkable performance, achieving 92.02% F1-Score and 94.56% Accuracy. A\ngeneralization study assesses the performance variation when the detector\nprocesses images from a territory substantially different from the one used\nduring training, incurring only a moderate performance loss, i.e., 6.5%\ndecrease in the F1-Score. Finally, an exercise in which photo interpreters\ncompare the territory scanning effort with and without the support of the waste\ndetector assesses the concrete benefit of using a computer-aided image analysis\ntool in a professional environment protection agency.

Amortization, through conditional estimation, is a viable\nstrategy to alleviate such difficulties and has been the guiding principle\nbehind simulation-based inference, neural processes and in-context methods\nusing pre-trained models. In this work, we conduct a thorough comparative\nanalysis of amortized in-context Bayesian posterior estimation methods from the\nlens of different optimization objectives and architectural choices. Such\nmethods train an amortized estimator to perform posterior parameter inference\nby conditioning on a set of data examples passed as context to a sequence model\nsuch as a transformer. In contrast to language models, we leverage permutation\ninvariant architectures as the true posterior is invariant to the ordering of\ncontext examples. Our empirical study includes generalization to\nout-of-distribution tasks, cases where the assumed underlying model is\nmisspecified, and transfer from simulated to real problems. Subsequently, it\nhighlights the superiority of the reverse KL estimator for predictive problems,\nespecially when combined with the transformer architecture and normalizing\nflows.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of image captions, looking at both linguistic fluency and\nsemantic correspondence to visual contents, has witnessed a significant effort.\nStill, despite advancements such as the CLIPScore metric, multilingual\ncaptioning evaluation has remained relatively unexplored. This work presents\nseveral strategies, and extensive experiments, related to evaluating CLIPScore\nvariants in multilingual settings. To address the lack of multilingual test\ndata, we consider two different strategies: (1) using quality aware\nmachine-translated datasets with human judgements, and (2) re-purposing\nmultilingual datasets that target semantic inference and reasoning. Our results\nhighlight the potential of finetuned multilingual models to generalize across\nlanguages and to handle complex linguistic challenges. Tests with\nmachine-translated data show that multilingual CLIPScore models can maintain a\nhigh correlation with human judgements across different languages, and\nadditional tests with natively multilingual and multicultural data further\nattest to the high-quality assessments.",

This has\nbeen recognized in the causal bandits literature, where a causal (multi-armed)\nbandit is characterized by a causal graphical model and a target variable. The\narms are then interventions on the causal model, and rewards are samples of the\ntarget variable. Causal bandits were originally studied with a focus on hard\ninterventions. We focus instead on cases where the arms are conditional\ninterventions, which more accurately model many real-world decision-making\nproblems by allowing the value of the intervened variable to be chosen based on\nthe observed values of other variables. This paper presents a graphical\ncharacterization of the minimal set of nodes guaranteed to contain the optimal\nconditional intervention, which maximizes the expected reward. We then propose\nan efficient algorithm with a time complexity of $O(|V| + |E|)$ to identify\nthis minimal set of nodes. We prove that the graphical characterization and the\nproposed algorithm are correct. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our\nalgorithm significantly prunes the search space and substantially accelerates\nconvergence rates when integrated into standard multi-armed bandit algorithms.",

In order to\nachieve this, we develop RoboART: an automated red teaming (ART) pipeline that\n(1) modifies nominal observations using generative image editing to vary\ndifferent environmental factors, and (2) predicts performance under each\nvariation using a policy-specific anomaly detector executed on edited\nobservations. Experiments across 500+ hardware trials in twelve off-nominal\nconditions for visuomotor diffusion policies demonstrate that RoboART predicts\nperformance degradation with high accuracy (less than 0.19 average difference\nbetween predicted and real success rates).

While this\nframework has been used in practice for assessing data quality, our experiments\nreveal inconsistent valuation outcomes across different utilities, albeit all\nrelated to ML performance. Beyond raising concerns about the reliability of\ndata valuation, this inconsistency is challenging to interpret, as it stems\nfrom the complex interaction of the utility with data points and semivalue\nweights, which has barely been studied in prior work. In this paper, we take a\nfirst step toward clarifying the utility impact on semivalue-based data\nvaluation. Specifically, we provide geometric interpretations of this impact\nfor a broad family of classification utilities, which includes the accuracy and\nthe arithmetic mean. We introduce the notion of spatial signatures: given a\nsemivalue, data points can be embedded into a two-dimensional space, and\nutility functions map to the dual of this space. This geometric perspective\nseparates the influence of the dataset and semivalue from that of the utility,\nproviding a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed sensitivity\nof valuation outcomes to the utility choice.",

This paper presents an\ninterdisciplinary meta-review of about 100 studies that discuss shortcomings in\nquantitative benchmarking practices, published in the last 10 years. It brings\ntogether many fine-grained issues in the design and application of benchmarks\n(such as biases in dataset creation, inadequate documentation, data\ncontamination, and failures to distinguish signal from noise) with broader\nsociotechnical issues (such as an over-focus on evaluating text-based AI models\naccording to one-time testing logic that fails to account for how AI models are\nincreasingly multimodal and interact with humans and other technical systems).\nOur review also highlights a series of systemic flaws in current benchmarking\npractices, such as misaligned incentives, construct validity issues, unknown\nunknowns, and problems with the gaming of benchmark results. Furthermore, it\nunderscores how benchmark practices are fundamentally shaped by cultural,\ncommercial and competitive dynamics that often prioritise state-of-the-art\nperformance at the expense of broader societal concerns.

In the case of the brain, two of the most important\ndata modalities are the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), and the intracranial\nelectroencephalogram (iEEG). They are used by human experts, supported by deep\nlearning (DL) models, to accomplish a variety of tasks, such as seizure\ndetection and motor imagery classification. Although the differences between\nEEG and iEEG are well understood by human experts, the performance of DL models\nacross these two modalities remains under-explored. To help characterize the\nimportance of clean data on the performance of DL models, we propose\nBrainCodec, a high-fidelity EEG and iEEG neural compressor. We find that\ntraining BrainCodec on iEEG and then transferring to EEG yields higher\nreconstruction quality than training on EEG directly. In addition, we also find\nthat training BrainCodec on both EEG and iEEG improves fidelity when\nreconstructing EEG. Our work indicates that data sources with higher SNR, such\nas iEEG, provide better performance across the board also in the medical\ntime-series domain. BrainCodec also achieves up to a 64x compression on iEEG\nand EEG without a notable decrease in quality. BrainCodec markedly surpasses\ncurrent state-of-the-art compression models both in final compression ratio and\nin reconstruction fidelity. We also evaluate the fidelity of the compressed\nsignals objectively on a seizure detection and a motor imagery task performed\nby standard DL models. Here, we find that BrainCodec achieves a reconstruction\nfidelity high enough to ensure no performance degradation on the downstream\ntasks. Finally, we collect the subjective assessment of an expert neurologist,\nthat confirms the high reconstruction quality of BrainCodec in a realistic\nscenario.

To\naddress this, here we present a simple yet powerful guidance-free approach\ncalled Boost-and-Skip for generating minority samples using diffusion models.\nThe key advantage of our framework requires only two minimal changes to\nstandard generative processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii)\ntimestep skipping. We highlight that these seemingly-trivial modifications are\nsupported by solid theoretical and empirical evidence, thereby effectively\npromoting emergence of underrepresented minority features. Our comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip greatly enhances the capability of\ngenerating minority samples, even rivaling guidance-based state-of-the-art\napproaches while requiring significantly fewer computations.",

We then implement an interviewing\nenvironment for the evaluation of LLM-guided conversation.

We\ncompare GuideLLM with 6 state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and\nLlama-3-70b-Instruct, from the perspective of interviewing quality, and\nautobiography generation quality. For automatic evaluation, we derive user\nproxies from multiple autobiographies and employ LLM-as-a-judge to score LLM\nbehaviors. We further conduct a human-involved experiment by employing 45 human\nparticipants to chat with GuideLLM and baselines.

    "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) is a key indicator of cardiovascular health. As\nhypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate,\ncontinuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount\nimportance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can\npotentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust\nmachine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data\nquality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups\nexplored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and\ndemonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution.\nConsidering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the\nquestion arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively\nbe exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work,\nwe take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by\ninvestigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can\neffectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the\nneed for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task.\nEvaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach\nachieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error\nof 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP\n(mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8\nquantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down\nto 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive,\nreal-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.",

Decentralized learning-based\napproaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems,\noffering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based\nMAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field\nof view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation\nin complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on\npotential movements between agents based on limited observations and\ncommunications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that\napplies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling\nagents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local\nconsensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In\nparticular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for\nachieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we\nincorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent\nspace based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning.\nDuring the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works,\neach agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to\nefficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance.

    "abstract": "Debating over conflicting issues is a necessary first step towards resolving\nconflicts. However, intrinsic perspectives of an arguer are difficult to\novercome by persuasive argumentation skills. Proceeding from a debate to a\ndeliberative process, where we can identify actionable options for resolving a\nconflict requires a deeper analysis of arguments and the perspectives they are\ngrounded in - as it is only from there that one can derive mutually agreeable\nresolution steps. In this work we develop a framework for a deliberative\nanalysis of arguments in a computational argumentation setup. We conduct a\nfine-grained analysis of perspectivized stances expressed in the arguments of\ndifferent arguers or stakeholders on a given issue, aiming not only to identify\ntheir opposing views, but also shared perspectives arising from their\nattitudes, values or needs. We formalize this analysis in Perspectivized Stance\nVectors that characterize the individual perspectivized stances of all arguers\non a given issue. We construct these vectors by determining issue- and\nargument-specific concepts, and predict an arguer's stance relative to each of\nthem. The vectors allow us to measure a modulated (dis)agreement between\narguers, structured by perspectives, which allows us to identify actionable\npoints for conflict resolution, as a first step towards deliberation.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained large foundation models for specific tasks has become\nincreasingly challenging due to the computational and storage demands\nassociated with full parameter updates. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\nmethods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters\nusing adapter modules. In this work, we propose \\emph{Quantum-Inspired\nAdapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum\ncircuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both\nexpressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large\nspace while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We\ntest our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision\ntransformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\\% of the\nperformance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter\ncompression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to\nexisting orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\\%\nrelative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive\nperformance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters.\nThrough ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight\norders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant\nfine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a\npromising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in\nresource-constrained environments.",

However, as typical black-box models, they pose challenges in\nunderstanding their decision basis and logic, limiting their deployment in\nhigh-reliability scenarios. Hence, various methods have been proposed to\nenhance the interpretability of IFD. Among these, post-hoc approaches can\nprovide explanations without changing model architecture, preserving its\nflexibility and scalability. However, existing post-hoc methods often suffer\nfrom limitations in explanation forms.

CS-SHAP can evaluate\ncontributions from both carrier and modulation frequencies, aligning more\nclosely with fault mechanisms and delivering clearer and more accurate\nexplanations. Three datasets are utilized to validate the superior\ninterpretability of CS-SHAP, ensuring its correctness, reproducibility, and\npractical performance.

Existing works, however, largely focus on\nreducing the impact of outliers from an algorithmic perspective, lacking an\nin-depth investigation into their causes and roles. In this work, we provide a\ndetailed analysis of the formation process, underlying causes, and functions of\noutliers in LLMs. We define and categorize three types of outliers-activation\noutliers, weight outliers, and attention outliers-and analyze their\ndistributions across different dimensions, uncovering inherent connections\nbetween their occurrences and their ultimate influence on the attention\nmechanism. Based on these observations, we hypothesize and explore the\nmechanisms by which these outliers arise and function, demonstrating through\ntheoretical derivations and experiments that they emerge due to the\nself-attention mechanism's softmax operation. These outliers act as implicit\ncontext-aware scaling factors within the attention mechanism. As these outliers\nstem from systematic influences, we term them systematic outliers. Our study\nnot only enhances the understanding of Transformer-based LLMs but also shows\nthat structurally eliminating outliers can accelerate convergence and improve\nmodel compression.

However, the limited\neFPGA logic and memory significantly constrain compute capabilities and model\nsize. As such, ML application deployment on eFPGAs is in direct contrast with\nthe most recent FPGA approaches developing architecture-specific\nimplementations and maximizing throughput over resource frugality. This paper\nfocuses on the opposite side of this trade-off: the proposed eFPGA accelerator\nfocuses on minimizing resource usage and allowing flexibility for on-field\nrecalibration over throughput. This allows for runtime changes in model size,\narchitecture, and input data dimensionality without offline resynthesis. This\nis made possible through the use of a bitwise compressed inference architecture\nof the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm. TM compute does not require any\nmultiplication operations, being limited to only bitwise AND, OR, NOT,\nsummations and additions. Additionally, TM model compression allows the entire\nmodel to fit within the on-chip block RAM of the eFPGA. The paper uses this\naccelerator to propose a strategy for runtime model tuning in the field. The\nproposed approach uses 2.5x fewer Look-up-Tables (LUTs) and 3.38x fewer\nregisters than the current most resource-fugal design and achieves up to 129x\nenergy reduction compared with low-power microcontrollers running the same ML\napplication.",

In this paper, we present a novel Point Dilation Mechanism for\nsingle-stage 3D detection (PDM-SSD) that takes advantage of these two\nrepresentations. Specifically, we first use a PointNet-style 3D backbone for\nefficient feature encoding. Then, a neck with Point Dilation Mechanism (PDM) is\nused to expand the feature space, which involves two key steps: point dilation\nand feature filling. The former expands points to a certain size grid centered\naround the sampled points in Euclidean space. The latter fills the unoccupied\ngrid with feature for backpropagation using spherical harmonic coefficients and\nGaussian density function in terms of direction and scale. Next, we associate\nmultiple dilation centers and fuse coefficients to obtain sparse grid features\nthrough height compression. Finally, we design a hybrid detection head for\njoint learning, where on one hand, the scene heatmap is predicted to complement\nthe voting point set for improved detection accuracy, and on the other hand,\nthe target probability of detected boxes are calibrated through feature fusion.\nOn the challenging Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological\nInstitute (KITTI) dataset, PDM-SSD achieves state-of-the-art results for\nmulti-class detection among single-modal methods with an inference speed of 68\nframes. We also demonstrate the advantages of PDM-SSD in detecting sparse and\nincomplete objects through numerous object-level instances. Additionally, PDM\ncan serve as an auxiliary network to establish a connection between sampling\npoints and object centers, thereby improving the accuracy of the model without\nsacrificing inference speed.

    "abstract": "It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher\nsuccess rates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box\nattacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on\npixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image\nclassification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily\ndepend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more\nsuitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge,\nquery-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object\ndetection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box\nattack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement\nLearning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget\nprocesses. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging\nrewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR\neffectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while\nadhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed\nattack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the\nconfidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the\nImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed\nstate-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the\nMSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction\nto state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Further\nexperiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAR\neffectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset.

    "abstract": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications depend on accurate price oracles to\nensure secure transactions, yet these oracles are highly vulnerable to\nmanipulation, enabling attackers to exploit smart contract vulnerabilities for\nunfair asset valuation and financial gain. Detecting such manipulations\ntraditionally relies on the manual effort of experienced experts, presenting\nsignificant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-driven framework\nthat automates the detection of price oracle manipulations by leveraging the\ncomplementary strengths of different LLM models (LLMs). Our approach begins\nwith domain-specific knowledge extraction, where an LLM model synthesizes\nprecise insights about price oracle vulnerabilities from top-tier academic\npapers, eliminating the need for profound expertise from developers or\nauditors. This knowledge forms the foundation for a second LLM model to\ngenerate structured, context-aware chain of thought prompts, which guide a\nthird LLM model in accurately identifying manipulation patterns in smart\ncontracts. We validate the effectiveness of framework through experiments on 60\nknown vulnerabilities from 46 real-world DeFi attacks or projects spanning 2021\nto 2023. The best performing combination of LLMs (Haiku-Haiku-4o-mini)\nidentified by AiRacleX demonstrate a 2.58-times improvement in recall (0.667 vs\n0.259) compared to the state-of-the-art tool GPTScan, while maintaining\ncomparable precision. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates the feasibility\nof replacing commercial models with open-source alternatives, enhancing privacy\nand security for developers.",

Key critics have argued that these\ntechnologies can perpetuate bias and discrimination, particularly against\nmarginalized groups. We contribute to this field of research by reporting on\nthe limitations of facial analysis systems with the faces of people with Down\nsyndrome: this particularly vulnerable group has received very little attention\nin the literature so far. This study involved the creation of a specific\ndataset of face images. An experimental group with faces of people with Down\nsyndrome, and a control group with faces of people who are not affected by the\nsyndrome. Two commercial tools were tested on the dataset, along three tasks:\ngender recognition, age prediction and face labelling. The results show an\noverall lower accuracy of prediction in the experimental group, and other\nspecific patterns of performance differences: i) high error rates in gender\nrecognition in the category of males with Down syndrome; ii) adults with Down\nsyndrome were more often incorrectly labelled as children; iii) social\nstereotypes are propagated in both the control and experimental groups, with\nlabels related to aesthetics more often associated with women, and labels\nrelated to education level and skills more often associated with men. These\nresults, although limited in scope, shed new light on the biases that alter\nface classification when applied to faces of people with Down syndrome.

By\nrepresenting tissue surfaces as point clouds and applying non-rigid point cloud\nregistration (PCR) methods, surgeons can better understand tissue deformations\nbefore, during, and after surgery. Existing non-rigid PCR methods, such as\nfeature-based approaches, struggle with robustness against challenges like\nnoise, outliers, partial data, and large deformations, making accurate point\ncorrespondence difficult. Although learning-based PCR methods, particularly\nTransformer-based approaches, have recently shown promise due to their\nattention mechanisms for capturing interactions, their robustness remains\nlimited in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we present DefTransNet, a\nnovel end-to-end Transformer-based architecture for non-rigid PCR. DefTransNet\nis designed to address the key challenges of deformable registration, including\nlarge deformations, outliers, noise, and partial data, by inputting source and\ntarget point clouds and outputting displacement vector fields. The proposed\nmethod incorporates a learnable transformation matrix to enhance robustness to\naffine transformations, integrates global and local geometric information, and\ncaptures long-range dependencies among points using Transformers. We validate\nour approach on four datasets: ModelNet, SynBench, 4DMatch, and DeformedTissue,\nusing both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the generalization of\nour proposed method.

Mainstream solutions adopt the memory\nreplay-based idea, ie, caching representative data from earlier tasks for\nretraining the graph model. However, this strategy struggles with scalability\nissues for constantly evolving graphs and raises concerns regarding data\nprivacy. Inspired by recent advancements in the prompt-based learning paradigm,\nthis paper introduces a novel prompt-driven continual graph learning\n(PROMPTCGL) framework, which learns a separate prompt for each incoming task\nand maintains the underlying graph neural network model fixed. In this way,\nPROMPTCGL naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting of knowledge from previous\ntasks. More specifically, we propose hierarchical prompting to instruct the\nmodel from both feature- and topology-level to fully address the variability of\ntask graphs in dynamic continual learning. Additionally, we develop a\npersonalized prompt generator to generate tailored prompts for each graph node\nwhile minimizing the number of prompts needed, leading to constant memory\nconsumption regardless of the graph scale. Extensive experiments on four\nbenchmarks show that PROMPTCGL achieves superior performance against existing\nCGL approaches while significantly reducing memory consumption.

However, the\ncommon practice of masking random patches of pixels exhibits certain failure\nmodes, which can prevent learning meaningful high-level features, as required\nfor downstream tasks. We propose an alternative masking strategy that operates\non a suitable transformation of the data rather than on the raw pixels.\nSpecifically, we perform principal component analysis and then randomly mask a\nsubset of components, which accounts for a fixed ratio of the data variance.\nThe learning task then amounts to reconstructing the masked components from the\nvisible ones. Compared to local patches of pixels, the principal components of\nimages carry more global information. We thus posit that predicting masked from\nvisible components involves more high-level features, allowing our masking\nstrategy to extract more useful representations. This is corroborated by our\nempirical findings which demonstrate improved image classification performance\nfor component over pixel masking. Our method thus constitutes a simple and\nrobust data-driven alternative to traditional masked image modeling approaches.",

In\nophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4\nmillion natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high\nadaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a\ngeneral-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown\npromise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks\nremains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations\nby fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular\ndisease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight\nstandardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and\nthe UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting\ndiabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets,\nall P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In\nglaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940,\nP<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2\nmodels in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke\n(AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even\nwith 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct\nscenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the\nimportance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise\nclinical performance.",

    "abstract": "The proteins that exist today have been optimized over billions of years of\nnatural evolution, during which nature creates random mutations and selects\nthem. The discovery of functionally promising mutations is challenged by the\nlimited evolutionary accessible regions, i.e., only a small region on the\nfitness landscape is beneficial. There have been numerous priors used to\nconstrain protein evolution to regions of landscapes with high-fitness\nvariants, among which the change in binding free energy (DDG) of protein\ncomplexes upon mutations is one of the most commonly used priors. However, the\nhuge mutation space poses two challenges: (1) how to improve the efficiency of\nDDG prediction for fast mutation screening; and (2) how to explain mutation\npreferences and efficiently explore accessible evolutionary regions. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a lightweight DDG predictor (Light-DDG), which\nadopts a structure-aware Transformer as the backbone and enhances it by\nknowledge distilled from existing powerful but computationally heavy DDG\npredictors. Additionally, we augmented, annotated, and released a large-scale\ndataset containing millions of mutation data for pre-training Light-DDG. We\nfind that such a simple yet effective Light-DDG can serve as a good\nunsupervised antibody optimizer and explainer. For the target antibody, we\npropose a novel Mutation Explainer to learn mutation preferences, which\naccounts for the marginal benefit of each mutation per residue. To further\nexplore accessible evolutionary regions, we conduct preference-guided antibody\noptimization and evaluate antibody candidates quickly using Light-DDG to\nidentify desirable mutations.",

Such discretion remains largely\nunexamined, posing two risks: (i) annotators may use their power of discretion\narbitrarily, and (ii) models may fail to mimic this discretion. To study this\nphenomenon, we draw on legal concepts of discretion that structure how\ndecision-making authority is conferred and exercised, particularly in cases\nwhere principles conflict or their application is unclear or irrelevant.\nExtended to AI alignment, discretion is required when alignment principles and\nrules are (inevitably) conflicting or indecisive. We present a set of metrics\nto systematically analyze when and how discretion in AI alignment is exercised,\nsuch that both risks (i) and (ii) can be observed. Moreover, we distinguish\nbetween human and algorithmic discretion and analyze the discrepancy between\nthem. By measuring both human and algorithmic discretion over safety alignment\ndatasets, we reveal layers of discretion in the alignment process that were\npreviously unaccounted for. Furthermore, we demonstrate how algorithms trained\non these datasets develop their own forms of discretion in interpreting and\napplying these principles, which challenges the purpose of having any\nprinciples at all.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized in software engineering (SE)\ntasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. However, their\nreliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises\nsignificant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is\nunintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The\ndata leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research\nand evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there\nis no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE\nbenchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first\nlarge-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our\nresults show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with\naverage leakage ratios of only 4.8\\%, 2.8\\%, and 0.7\\% for Python, Java, and\nC/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively\nhigher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation.\nFor instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\\% and\n55.7\\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a\nsubstantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data\nleakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training\ndatasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark\nconstruction. To address the data leakage, we introduce\n\\textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the\n83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research.\nOur study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and\nprovides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE.",

In geographic machine learning tasks,\nconventional statistical learning methods often struggle to capture spatial\nheterogeneity, leading to unsatisfactory prediction accuracy and unreliable\ninterpretability. While approaches like Geographically Weighted Regression\n(GWR) capture local variations, they fall short of uncovering global patterns\nand tracking the continuous evolution of spatial heterogeneity. Motivated by\nthis limitation, we propose a novel perspective - that is, simultaneously\nmodeling common features across different locations alongside spatial\ndifferences using deep neural networks. The proposed method is a dual-branch\nneural network with an encoder-decoder structure. In the encoding stage, the\nmethod aggregates node information in a spatiotemporal conditional graph using\nGCN and LSTM, encoding location-specific spatiotemporal heterogeneity as an\nimplicit conditional vector. Additionally, a self-attention-based encoder is\nused to extract location-invariant common features from the data. In the\ndecoding stage, the approach employs a conditional generation strategy that\npredicts response variables and interpretative weights based on data features\nunder spatiotemporal conditions. The approach is validated by predicting\nvegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) using global climate and land cover\ndata from 2001 to 2020.

    "abstract": "Transformers have recently shown strong performance in time-series\nforecasting, but their all-to-all attention mechanism overlooks the (temporal)\ncausal and often (temporally) local nature of data. We introduce Powerformer, a\nnovel Transformer variant that replaces noncausal attention weights with causal\nweights that are reweighted according to a smooth heavy-tailed decay. This\nsimple yet effective modification endows the model with an inductive bias\nfavoring temporally local dependencies, while still allowing sufficient\nflexibility to learn the unique correlation structure of each dataset. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that Powerformer not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on public time-series benchmarks, but also that it\noffers improved interpretability of attention patterns. Our analyses show that\nthe model's locality bias is amplified during training, demonstrating an\ninterplay between time-series data and power-law-based attention. These\nfindings highlight the importance of domain-specific modifications to the\nTransformer architecture for time-series forecasting, and they establish\nPowerformer as a strong, efficient, and principled baseline for future research\nand real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Efficient exploration is critical for learning relational models in\nlarge-scale environments with complex, long-horizon tasks. Random exploration\nmethods often collect redundant or irrelevant data, limiting their ability to\nlearn accurate relational models of the environment. Goal-literal babbling\n(GLIB) improves upon random exploration by setting and planning to novel goals,\nbut its reliance on random actions and random novel goal selection limits its\nscalability to larger domains. In this work, we identify the principles\nunderlying efficient exploration in relational domains: (1) operator\ninitialization with demonstrations that cover the distinct lifted effects\nnecessary for planning and (2) refining preconditions to collect maximally\ninformative transitions by selecting informative goal-action pairs and\nexecuting plans to them. To demonstrate these principles, we introduce\nBaking-Large, a challenging domain with extensive state-action spaces and\nlong-horizon tasks. We evaluate methods using oracle-driven demonstrations for\noperator initialization and precondition-targeting guidance to efficiently\ngather critical transitions. Experiments show that both the oracle\ndemonstrations and precondition-targeting oracle guidance significantly improve\nsample efficiency and generalization, paving the way for future methods to use\nthese principles to efficiently learn accurate relational models in complex\ndomains.",

Decomposing the mixed frequency components into multiple single\nfrequency components is a natural choice. However, the information density of\npatterns varies across different frequencies, and employing a uniform modeling\napproach for different frequency components can lead to inaccurate\ncharacterization. To address this challenges, inspired by the flexibility of\nthe recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose a KAN-based Frequency\nDecomposition Learning architecture (TimeKAN) to address the complex\nforecasting challenges caused by multiple frequency mixtures. Specifically,\nTimeKAN mainly consists of three components: Cascaded Frequency Decomposition\n(CFD) blocks, Multi-order KAN Representation Learning (M-KAN) blocks and\nFrequency Mixing blocks.

Benefiting from the high\nflexibility of KAN, we design a novel M-KAN block to learn and represent\nspecific temporal patterns within each frequency band. Finally, Frequency\nMixing blocks is used to recombine the frequency bands into the original\nformat. Extensive experimental results across multiple real-world time series\ndatasets demonstrate that TimeKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance as an\nextremely lightweight architecture.

    "abstract": "The conventional resource search in cloud infrastructure relies on\nkeyword-based searches or GUIDs, which demand exact matches and significant\nuser effort to locate resources. These conventional search approaches often\nfail to interpret the intent behind natural language queries, making resource\ndiscovery inefficient and inaccessible to users. Though there exists some form\nof NLP based search engines, they are limited and focused more on analyzing the\nNLP query itself and extracting identifiers to find the resources. But they\nfail to search resources based on their behavior or operations or their\ncapabilities or relationships or features or business relevance or the dynamic\nchanging state or the knowledge these resources have. The search criteria has\nbeen changing with the inundation of AI based services which involved\ndiscovering not just the requested resources and identifiers but seeking\ninsights. The real intent of a search has never been to just to list the\nresources but with some actual context such as to understand causes of some\nbehavior in the system, compliance checks, capacity estimations, network\nconstraints, or troubleshooting or business insights. This paper proposes an\nadvanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) enhanced by ontology-based semantics\nto enable intuitive, human-readable queries which allows users to actually\ndiscover the intent-of-search itself. By constructing an ontology of cloud\nresources, their interactions, and behaviors, the proposed framework enables\ndynamic intent extraction and relevance ranking using Latent Semantic Indexing\n(LSI) and AI models. It introduces an automated pipeline which integrates\nontology extraction by AI powered data crawlers, building a semantic knowledge\nbase for context aware resource discovery.",

    "abstract": "Reranking plays a crucial role in modern multi-stage recommender systems by\nrearranging the initial ranking list. Due to the inherent challenges of\ncombinatorial search spaces, some current research adopts an\nevaluator-generator paradigm, with a generator generating feasible sequences\nand an evaluator selecting the best sequence based on the estimated list\nutility. However, these methods still face two issues. Firstly, due to the goal\ninconsistency problem between the evaluator and generator, the generator tends\nto fit the local optimal solution of exposure distribution rather than\ncombinatorial space optimization. Secondly, the strategy of generating target\nitems one by one is difficult to achieve optimality because it ignores the\ninformation of subsequent items.\n  To address these issues, we propose a utilizing Neighbor Lists model for\nGenerative Reranking (NLGR), which aims to improve the performance of the\ngenerator in the combinatorial space. NLGR follows the evaluator-generator\nparadigm and improves the generator's training and generating methods.\nSpecifically, we use neighbor lists in combination space to enhance the\ntraining process, making the generator perceive the relative scores and find\nthe optimization direction. Furthermore, we propose a novel sampling-based\nnon-autoregressive generation method, which allows the generator to jump\nflexibly from the current list to any neighbor list. Extensive experiments on\npublic and industrial datasets validate NLGR's effectiveness and we have\nsuccessfully deployed NLGR on the Meituan food delivery platform.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces rateless joint source-channel coding (rateless JSCC).\nThe code is rateless in that it is designed and optimized for a continuum of\ncoding rates such that it achieves a desired distortion for any rate in that\ncontinuum. We further introduce rate-adaptive and stable communication link\noperation to accommodate rateless JSCCs. The link operation resembles a ``bit\npipe'' that is identified by its rate in bits per frame, and, by the rate of\nbits that are flipped in each frame. Thus, the link operation is rate-adaptive\nsuch that it punctures the rateless JSCC codeword to adapt its length (and\ncoding rate) to the underlying channel capacity, and is stable in maintaining\nthe bit flipping ratio across time frames.\n  Next, a new family of autoencoder rateless JSCC codes are introduced. The\ncode family is dubbed RLACS code (read as relax code, standing for ratelss and\nlossy autoencoder channel and source code). The code is tested for\nreconstruction loss of image signals and demonstrates powerful performance that\nis resilient to variation of channel quality. RLACS code is readily applicable\nto the case of semantic distortion suited to variety of semantic and\neffectiveness communications use cases.\n  In the second part of the paper, we dive into the practical concerns around\nsemantic communication and provide a blueprint for semantic networking system\ndesign relying on updating the existing network systems with some essential\nmodifications. We further outline a comprehensive list of open research\nproblems and development challenges towards a practical 6G communications\nsystem design that enables semantic networking.",

    "abstract": "Many cattle farmers still depend on manual methods to measure the live weight\ngain of cattle at set intervals, which is time consuming, labour intensive, and\nstressful for both the animals and handlers. A remote and autonomous monitoring\nsystem using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) can provide a more\nefficient and less invasive method and also predictive capabilities for future\ncattle weight gain (CWG). This system allows continuous monitoring and\nestimation of individual cattle live weight gain, growth rates and weight\nfluctuations considering various factors like environmental conditions, genetic\npredispositions, feed availability, movement patterns and behaviour. Several\nresearchers have explored the efficiency of estimating CWG using ML and DL\nalgorithms. However, estimating CWG suffers from a lack of consistency in its\napplication. Moreover, ML or DL can provide weight gain estimations based on\nseveral features that vary in existing research. Additionally, previous studies\nhave encountered various data related challenges when estimating CWG. This\npaper presents a comprehensive investigation in estimating CWG using advanced\nML techniques based on research articles (between 2004 and 2024). This study\ninvestigates the current tools, methods, and features used in CWG estimation,\nas well as their strengths and weaknesses. The findings highlight the\nsignificance of using advanced ML approaches in CWG estimation and its critical\ninfluence on factors. Furthermore, this study identifies potential research\ngaps and provides research direction on CWG prediction, which serves as a\nreference for future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning rely heavily on massive datasets, leading to\nsubstantial storage and training costs. Dataset pruning aims to alleviate this\ndemand by discarding redundant examples. However, many existing methods require\ntraining a model with a full dataset over a large number of epochs before being\nable to prune the dataset, which ironically makes the pruning process more\nexpensive than just training the model on the entire dataset. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce a Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL)\nscore, which aims to identify important samples from the early training stage\nby considering both example difficulty and prediction uncertainty. To address a\ncatastrophic accuracy drop at an extreme pruning, we further propose a\nratio-adaptive sampling using Beta distribution. Experiments on various\ndatasets and learning scenarios such as image classification with label noise\nand image corruption, and model architecture generalization demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.\nSpecifically, on ImageNet-1k, our method reduces the time cost for pruning to\n66% compared to previous methods while achieving a SOTA, specifically 60% test\naccuracy at a 90% pruning ratio. On CIFAR datasets, the time cost is reduced to\njust 15% while maintaining SOTA performance.",

    "abstract": "We prove that a minimal Transformer with frozen weights emulates a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. We formalize two modes of in-context algorithm emulation. In the task-specific mode, for any continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we show the existence of a single-head softmax attention layer whose forward pass reproduces functions of the form $f(w^\\top x - y)$ to arbitrary precision. This general template subsumes many popular machine learning algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, linear regression, ridge regression). In the prompt-programmable mode, we prove universality: a single fixed-weight two-layer softmax attention module emulates all algorithms from the task-specific class (i.e., each implementable by a single softmax attention) via only prompting. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All adaptation happens through the prompt alone. Numerical results corroborate our theory. These findings forge a direct link between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms via prompts alone, and establish a form of algorithmic universality in modern Transformer models.",

While imitation learning offers a promising approach, acquiring comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive. In this work, we propose a learning framework and system LodeStar that automatically decomposes task demonstrations into semantically meaningful skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates diverse synthetic demonstration datasets from a few human demos through reinforcement learning. These sim-augmented datasets enable robust skill training, with a Skill Routing Transformer (SRT) policy effectively chaining the learned skills together to execute complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Experimental evaluations on three challenging real-world long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves task performance and robustness compared to previous baselines.

    "abstract": "We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior (PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity. The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.",

    "abstract": "The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals $k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where computation in LLMs behaves linearly.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies, demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting. While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction, anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.",

In the test, six colors (red, green, blue, magenta, turquoise, yellow) were evaluated with pairwise comparisons as well as in a direct manner, on color-calibrated tablets in ISO standardized sensory test booths of a sensory laboratory. All the possible patterns of comparisons resulting in a connected representing graph were evaluated against the complete data based on 301 individual's pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) using the logarithmic least squares weight calculation technique. It is shown that the empirical results, i.e., the empirical distributions of the elements of PCMs, are quite similar to the former simulated outcomes from the literature. The obtained empirically optimal patterns of comparisons were the best or the second best in the former simulations as well, while the sequence of comparisons that contains the most (close to) optimal patterns is exactly the same. In order to enhance the applicability of the results, besides the presentation of graph of graphs, and the representing graphs of the patterns that describe the proposed sequence of comparisons themselves, the recommendations are also detailed in a table format as well as in a Java application.",

Reward hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship, encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.",

While both DINO and Barlow Twins have independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware. By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\\% of labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.

    "abstract": "This study explores how the selection of neuron models and learning rules impacts the classification performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with a focus on applications in bio-signal processing. We compare biologically inspired neuron models, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), metaneurons, and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neurons, across multiple learning rules, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), tempotron, and reward-modulated updates. A novel element of this work is the integration of a complexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the structural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a consistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To investigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed synthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels. These included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to simulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of biological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data reveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the LZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or noisy signals. This work delivers a systematic analysis of how neuron model selection interacts with network parameters and learning strategies, supported by a novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers a consistent benchmark for SNN performance.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space. However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions; and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal representations under each relation context. The training objective combines inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.",

Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the Task03\\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision medicine.",

We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities, reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized identities.",

An ``allocation facilitator'' aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off. Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a. `budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.",

To address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3) Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method, which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency. The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves code correctness by 10.18\\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\\% on a 7B model, achieving performance comparable to much larger model.",

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components. First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\\%-38\\% communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\\%-40\\% communication cost on ResNet-34, while maintaining model accuracy within 1\\% degradation.",

However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and region-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from 45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was measured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using >=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive performance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related covariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup effects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive domains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed. These associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among participants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with subcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as regional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and perceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day was associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the midday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings across subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits, with global gains projected to reach USD 760 billion annually by 2050.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed by~\\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.",

Theoretical analysis extends to linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, providing practical guidance on the choice of decay exponents through the balance between empirical risk and variance. Empirical results show that Anti-regularization mitigates underfitting in both regression and classification while preserving generalization and improving calibration. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and safeguards are essential to avoiding overfitting and instability. As an alternative, we also propose a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that maintains constant per-sample complexity.

With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong performance in classification tasks under limited data availability, establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid, low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification and significant limitations in regression and clustering.",

It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration (RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

    "abstract": "Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.",

    "abstract": "The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations. Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.",

Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection, reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed commercial systems.",

    "abstract": "Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines, including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark. AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality, enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.",

    "abstract": "AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.\n  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.\n  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.\n  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.",

    "abstract": "Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning. However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648 Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and retrieval-augmented methods.",

In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal framework that combines BMS and acoustic microphone signals (AMS) to achieve both noise suppression and high-frequency reconstruction. Unlike conventional multi-modal approaches that simply merge features, our method employs two specialized networks: a mapping-based model to enhance BMS and a masking-based model to denoise AMS. These networks are integrated through a dynamic fusion mechanism that adapts to local noise conditions, ensuring the optimal use of each modality's strengths. We performed evaluations on the TAPS dataset, augmented with DNS-2023 noise clips, using objective speech quality metrics. The results clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-modal solutions in a wide range of noisy environments.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the timeliness of knowledge updates and the factual accuracy of responses in large language models. However, incorporating a large number of retrieved documents significantly increases input length, leading to higher computational costs. Existing approaches to document compression tailored for RAG often degrade task performance, as they typically rely on predefined heuristics in the absence of clear compression guidelines. These heuristics fail to ensure that the compressed content effectively supports downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method for lossless context compression in RAG. CORE is optimized end-to-end and does not depend on predefined compression labels, which are often impractical to obtain. Instead, it leverages downstream task performance as a feedback signal, iteratively refining the compression policy to enhance task effectiveness. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE. With a high compression ratio of 3%, CORE not only prevents performance degradation compared to including full documents (i.e., without compression) but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code for CORE will be released soon.",

It not only helps students learn about realistic trial procedures, but also provides practical value for case analysis and judgment prediction. Traditional mock trials are difficult to access by the public because they rely on professional tutors and human participants. Fortunately, the rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for creating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising, existing research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the systematic design and evaluation of court simulations, which are actually more important for the credibility and usage of court simulation in practice. To this end, we present the first court simulation framework -- SimCourt -- based on the real-world procedure structure of Chinese courts. Our framework replicates all 5 core stages of a Chinese trial and incorporates 5 courtroom roles, faithfully following the procedural definitions in China. To simulate trial participants with different roles, we propose and craft legal agents equipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities. Experiment on legal judgment prediction show that our framework can generate simulated trials that better guide the system to predict the imprisonment, probation, and fine of each case. Further annotations by human experts show that agents' responses under our simulation framework even outperformed judges and lawyers from the real trials in many scenarios. These further demonstrate the potential of LLM-based court simulation.",

    "abstract": "Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.",

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that enables \"thinking about thinking\". This absence leaves their emergent abilities uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science, Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts; and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and model backbones.",

    "abstract": "The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on. Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness. Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics. Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in the performance of LoRA training.",

In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+ lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset, which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the \"Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability,\" Track 2: Audio-Visual Detection and Localization (DDL-AV), and won first place in this competition.",

We introduce KAIROS, a benchmark that simulates quiz-style collaboration with peer agents whose rapport levels and behaviours can be precisely controlled in both historical interactions and the current round. This unified setup enables systematic analysis of how rapport, peer actions, and the model's self-confidence jointly influence decision-making. Using KAIROS, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO). Results show that model scale is a primary factor moderating susceptibility to social influence: larger models are more resilient and benefit from prompting-based mitigation, whereas smaller models remain vulnerable. Only carefully configured GRPO training yields consistent robustness and performance gains for small models.",

Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management; however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.",

To address these challenges, we propose a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability, ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing, such as real-time object detection in SEWs.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the right lens for understanding why these models generalize.",

    "abstract": "Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection (MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models, with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based models.",

To address these gaps, this work proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition, this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.",

Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.",

    "abstract": "As the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes sectors - like healthcare, finance, education, justice, and infrastructure has increased - the possibility and impact of failures of these systems have significantly evolved from being a theoretical possibility to practical recurring, systemic risk. This paper introduces CORTEX (Composite Overlay for Risk Tiering and Exposure), a multi-layered risk scoring framework proposed to assess and score AI system vulnerabilities, developed on empirical analysis of over 1,200 incidents documented in the AI Incident Database (AIID), CORTEX categorizes failure modes into 29 technical vulnerability groups. Each vulnerability is scored through a five-tier architecture that combines: (1) utility-adjusted Likelihood x Impact calculations; (2) governance + contextual overlays aligned with regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, NIST RMF, OECD principles; (3) technical surface scores, covering exposure vectors like drift, traceability, and adversarial risk; (4) environmental and residual modifiers tailored to context of where these systems are being deployed to use; and (5) a final layered assessment via Bayesian risk aggregation and Monte Carlo simulation to model volatility and long-tail risks. The resulting composite score can be operationalized across AI risk registers, model audits, conformity checks, and dynamic governance dashboards.",

First, we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the need for more targeted development in this domain.

Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\\tt MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of {\\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.",

    "abstract": "Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation, its application to generative speech restoration remains largely under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency, and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models (MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce scenarios like singing voice restoration.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context. However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context. Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of \\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement. Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization, improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general instruction-following capabilities.

Graph RAG has emerged as an advanced paradigm that leverages graph-based knowledge structures to provide more coherent and contextually rich answers. However, the move from plain document retrieval to structured graph traversal introduces new, under-explored privacy risks. This paper investigates the data extraction vulnerabilities of the Graph RAG systems. We design and execute tailored data extraction attacks to probe their susceptibility to leaking both raw text and structured data, such as entities and their relationships. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while Graph RAG systems may reduce raw text leakage, they are significantly more vulnerable to the extraction of structured entity and relationship information. We also explore potential defense mechanisms to mitigate these novel attack surfaces. This work provides a foundational analysis of the unique privacy challenges in Graph RAG and offers insights for building more secure systems.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent, interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained. Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding the ``effort\" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.",

This highlights the importance of efficient path planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework. Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies, our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions. Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.",

However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.

However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.",

Uncertainty comes from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of action values with a $\\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.

In this framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection, achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data, highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in resource-constrained environments.",

Focusing on three key categories, individual chance-constrained models, joint chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming models, we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through structured tasks using chain-of-thought and agentic reasoning. We introduce a novel soft-scoring metric that evaluates the structural quality and partial correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and execution-based accuracy metrics. Across a diverse set of SO problems, GPT-4-Turbo achieves better partial scores than GPT-3.5 variants except for individual chance-constrained problems. Structured prompts significantly outperform simple prompting, reducing extra-element generation and improving objective matching, although extra-element generation remains a nontrivial task.

Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work, we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences. While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2) Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4) Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating overconfident behavior.",

    "abstract": "A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations. Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.",

    "abstract": "Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in designing attention for graph transformers.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) has emerged as a powerful method for continual learning. However, its Euclidean projections do not leverage the underlying information-geometric structure of the problem, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To address this, we propose incorporating the natural gradient into OGD and present \\textbf{ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent)}. ONG preconditions each new task-specific gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks, ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior tasks' natural gradients. We provide an initial theoretical justification for this procedure, introduce the Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent (ONG) algorithm, and present preliminary results on the Permuted and Rotated MNIST benchmarks. Our preliminary results, however, indicate that a naive combination of natural gradients and orthogonal projections has potential issues. This finding has motivated continued future work focused on robustly reconciling these geometric perspectives to develop a continual learning method, establishing a more rigorous theoretical foundation with formal convergence guarantees, and extending empirical validation to large-scale continual learning benchmarks.",

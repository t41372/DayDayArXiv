      "abstract": "Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse\nspoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of\nhuman communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies\nacross different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily\nevaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30\nseconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments\nthat more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We\nintroduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio\nbenchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation,\nemotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in\nlength. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each\npaired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers.\nOur audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent\na human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six\nopen-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them,\nincluding advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the\ntasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the\ntrade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that\naudio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as\nduration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning,\ncounting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on\nprompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework\nto develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.",

We introduce a formal model of a\n\"minimal agent\" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments.\nUsing algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability\nand computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to\nunpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective\ngoal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external\nprediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate\nthis to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of\nits behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central\nthesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies\nundecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems\nfrom predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment\ncoupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and\nrelevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical\nsolutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This\nframework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction,\noffering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI,\nand reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally\nirreducible universe.",

It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to\nstandard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to\nproduce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast\nenhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to\nstandard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential\nside effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations,\nwe propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual\nContrast Enhancement in CESM.

Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a\ncommon strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to\nthe thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently,\nself-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds\nguided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and\ndisregards different numbers of outputs.\n  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the\ngeneration of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing\na limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs\n- DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR\ntask. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K,\n30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess\ntheir repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.\n  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning\ndataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible\npatches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using\nFull Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to\ndiminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base\nmodels greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather\nthan generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative\nstrategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned\nmodels, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages,\nparticularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for\nbalanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative\nrefinement.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has\nan extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ\nfailure, and potentially death. Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early\ndetection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods\noften identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our\nproject aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based\nsystem to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more\ntime to intervene.\n  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient\ninformation or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab\nresults. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their\nability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we\npropose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which\nidentifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features\nacross multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically\nrelevant.\n  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to\npopulation bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained\non diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models\ncontribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across\ndifferent patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a\npractical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in\nhospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient\noutcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare\ndelivery.",

However, the\ngrowing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises\nserious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset\nownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks\ninto the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks\nremain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when\ntriggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness\nagainst copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we\nexplore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models\nto circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose\nthe first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to\nundermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three\nstages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient\nwatermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models\nexhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning,\nevident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can\nreliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens\nfrom the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in\nintermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens.

We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent\nevaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., \"If you find that\nthe button is disabled, don't click it again\", or \"This agent has too much\nautonomy to decide what to do on its own\", into metrics for evaluating\nfine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by\ngrounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and\nnegative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and\nconcrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as\nevaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a\nset of (induced) metrics with open feedback: \"coverage\" and \"redundancy\".\nThrough optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate\nAutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the\nones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics\nto analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent\nimprovement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better\nprompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text\ngame tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%.

      "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown strong capability in enhancing\nlanguage models' knowledge and reducing AI generative hallucinations, driving\nits widespread use. However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance.\n  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,\n\\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and\nmulti-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system\nself-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs\nwith intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic\ntraining data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,\nwhich are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and\nunsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information\nsufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG\nsystem has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval\ndecisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context\nreinforcement learning.\n  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an\neffective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is\nsystem-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring\nmodifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,\neliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process\nsupervision data.",

      "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable\nbreakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and\nbeyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private\ndata for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated\nlearning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing\nraw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in\nreal-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous\ncomputing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these\nchallenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on\nheterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights\nbased on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures\nthe decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines\nthe model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices.\nFinally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support\nheterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks\nin training accuracy and convergence speed.",

While existing\nmethods can identify these effects from causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),\nthe true underlying structure is often unknown in practice. Essential graphs,\nwhich represent a Markov equivalence class of DAGs characterized by the same\nset of d-separations, provide a more practical and realistic alternative.\nHowever, learning the full essential graph is computationally intensive and\ntypically depends on strong, untestable assumptions. In this work, we\ncharacterize a local class of graphs, defined relative to a target variable,\nthat share a specific subset of d-separations, and introduce a graphical\nrepresentation of this class, called the local essential graph (LEG). We then\npresent LocPC, a novel algorithm designed to recover the LEG from an observed\ndistribution using only local conditional independence tests. Building on\nLocPC, we propose LocPC-CDE, an algorithm that discovers the portion of the LEG\nthat is sufficient to identify a CDE, bypassing the need of retrieving the full\nessential graph. Compared to global methods, our algorithms require less\nconditional independence tests and operate under weaker assumptions while\nmaintaining theoretical guarantees.",

Notably, they can\napproach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the\nneed for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some\nchallenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or\nmissing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems\ncannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a\ntime-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information\nto enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for\nzero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the\nhierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune\nthe candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input\nprompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets\nshows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only\nenhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific\nmodels. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the\nleveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.",

To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark\ncomprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad\nchallenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g.,\nalgebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete\nmathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we\nintroduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates:\n(1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization,\n(2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering\nstrategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert\nannotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification\nwhile ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant\nlimitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under\npractical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling\nin algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation\ntactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between\nnatural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought\nreasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning\nintroduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We\nbelieve that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal\nmathematical reasoning.",

When these agents operate independently for extended periods without\nhuman oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift.\nDetecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its\noriginal objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can\nshift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents\nare first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to\ncompeting objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while\nthe best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains\nnearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most\ndifficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal\ndrift.

Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect\nor irrelevant information to suppress knowledge. Such methods effectively\nconstitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models\nvulnerable to probing. In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from\nobfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess\nwhether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information. Moreover, we\npropose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive\ndistribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using\nKL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and\ntriggering appropriate refusal behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that\nDF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level\nuncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.",

The condition is supported by mathematical\nproofs. This criterion combines aspects of architecture design, regularization,\nand training data properties. A carefully designed minimal example illustrates\nan intuitive understanding of the condition. We also discuss the potential of\nthe condition for assessing compositional generalization before training. This\nwork is a fundamental theoretical study of compositional generalization in\nneural networks.",

Here, we investigate whether\nembracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a\ndynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more\nhuman-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve\nand should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with\nwhichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single\nsystem dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that\nmisalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical\nimpossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in\nthis contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We\nintroduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and\nintervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise\nfriendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that\nopen models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in\nproprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of\nbehaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more\nsteerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems.

Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens\nspanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks,\nincluding the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding\nBenchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter\nmodel achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the\n1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile.\nThese advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language\nmodeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI\nmore accessible for resource-constrained applications.",

Consider for example training a next-word prediction model for\nkeyboards: user-specific language patterns due to demographics (dialect, age,\netc.), language proficiency, and writing style result in a highly non-IID\ndataset across clients. Other examples are medical images taken with different\nmachines, or driving data from different vehicle types. To address this, we\npropose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework\n(pFedLIA) that utilizes a computationally efficient influence approximation,\ncalled `Lazy Influence', to cluster clients in a distributed manner before\nmodel aggregation. Within each cluster, data owners collaborate to jointly\ntrain a model that captures the specific data patterns of the clients. Our\nmethod has been shown to successfully recover the global model's performance\ndrop due to the non-IID-ness in various synthetic and real-world settings,\nspecifically a next-word prediction task on the Nordic languages as well as\nseveral benchmark tasks. It matches the performance of a hypothetical Oracle\nclustering, and significantly improves on existing baselines, e.g., an\nimprovement of 17% on CIFAR100.",

As each newly produced token is appended to the partial\noutput sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due\nto the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of\nall previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As\nthis iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,\nlayer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often\nresults in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and\nreduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture\npartitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular\nintervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based\non instantaneous information about device resource availability and network\nlink bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices,\nand in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum\nof migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the\ndecoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its\nkey-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become\ntight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit\nparallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions\nin inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5\ndevices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact\noptimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable\nimprovements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art\nlayer-based partitioning approaches.",

However, the relatively long\nwavelength of THz waves limits sub-diffraction-scale imaging resolution.\nAlthough TSPI technique can achieve sub-wavelength resolution, it requires\nharsh experimental conditions and time-consuming processes. Here, we propose a\nsub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We\nilluminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The\ntransmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back\nsurface of a 500-{\\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited\ncarriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a\nsingle-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively\nreconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625%\nunder a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To\nfurther suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular\nspectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during\npropagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object,\nenabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\\lambda}0/7\n({\\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin\nphotomodulators.

      "abstract": "We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which\nestimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the\nobservations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities,\nleading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this\nproblem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP\nChallenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose\nsolution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not\nstraightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities\ndrastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these\nambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first\nlearns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's\nsurface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation\nenables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D\ncorrespondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution\nusing PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex\nnon-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art\nsolutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from\nan RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.",

By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where\nthe model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers,\nindicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting\nnecessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial\nforgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce\nthe Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized\nprocess for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their\ntraining sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial\nforgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to\nmitigate essential forgetting.

The\nobjective takes into account the operational cost as well as the satisfaction\nof drivers. This problem is heavily constrained due to strict legal rules and\ncollective agreements. The objective of this article is to provide\nstate-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide\nhigh-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a\ncomprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&P), as well as\na Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&P or Column Generation\n(CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates\na novel deeper integration of B&P and LNS, storing the generated columns from\nthe LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better\nglobal solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several\ncomponents of the solution methods and their impact, including general\nimprovements for the B&P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource\nConstrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The\nevaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for\ninstances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low\ngaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe\nthat B&P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight\nintegration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger\ninstances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box.

Existing approaches typically sum all\nreward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and\npolicy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy\noptimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To\naddress this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework\nbased on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the\nlearning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization\nprocess, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner.\nSpecifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch\ncorresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each\nbranch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are\nautomatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a\nrule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it\nselects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts\nthat evaluate the performance of each branch.

A key challenge\nis determining the optimal timing for integrating these\nmodalities-specifically, identifying the network layers where fusion modules\nshould be inserted. Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or\nexhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of\nconverging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm\nthat incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at\ndifferent layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains\nfrom previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the\nbest-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search\nspace, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without\nexhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated\non two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks.\nOur algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal\nbaselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion\nplacements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and\nspecificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore,\nthe sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational\noverhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically\ndetermining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances\nmultimodal deep learning for medical imaging. It provides an efficient and\nrobust framework for fusion optimization, paving the way for improved clinical\ndecision-making and more adaptable, scalable architectures in medical AI\napplications.",

Empirical studies on\neleven AI tasks (e.g., large language models' instruction-following tasks)\ndemonstrate that iPFL consistently achieves the highest economic utility, and\nbetter or comparable model performance compared to baseline methods. We\nanticipate that our iPFL can serve as a valuable technique for boosting future\nAI models on decentralized private data while making everyone satisfied.",

While deep learning has advanced\npest detection, most existing approaches rely solely on low-level visual\nfeatures and lack effective multi-modal integration, leading to limited\naccuracy and poor interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality\nmulti-modal agricultural datasets further restricts progress in this field. To\naddress these issues, we construct two novel multi-modal benchmarks-CTIP102 and\nSTIP102-based on the widely-used IP102 dataset, and introduce a Multi-scale\nCross-Modal Fusion Network (MSFNet-CPD) for robust pest detection. Our approach\nenhances visual quality via a super-resolution reconstruction module, and feeds\nboth the original and reconstructed images into the network to improve clarity\nand detection performance. To better exploit semantic cues, we propose an\nImage-Text Fusion (ITF) module for joint modeling of visual and textual\nfeatures, and an Image-Text Converter (ITC) that reconstructs fine-grained\ndetails across multiple scales to handle challenging backgrounds. Furthermore,\nwe introduce an Arbitrary Combination Image Enhancement (ACIE) strategy to\ngenerate a more complex and diverse pest detection dataset, MTIP102, improving\nthe model's generalization to real-world scenarios.

While recent\nadvances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), such as Large Language\nModels (LLMs), have been applied to semantic communication designs, the\npotential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains largely unexplored. In this\npaper, we investigate an LMM-based vehicle AI assistant using a Large Language\nand Vision Assistant (LLaVA) and propose a task-oriented semantic communication\nframework to facilitate efficient interaction between users and cloud servers.\nTo reduce computational demands and shorten response time, we optimize LLaVA's\nimage slicing to selectively focus on areas of utmost interest to users.\nAdditionally, we assess the importance of image patches by combining objective\nand subjective user attention, adjusting energy usage for transmitting semantic\ninformation. This strategy optimizes resource utilization, ensuring precise\ntransmission of critical information. We construct a Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) dataset for traffic scenarios to evaluate effectiveness. Experimental\nresults show that our semantic communication framework significantly increases\naccuracy in answering questions under the same channel conditions, performing\nparticularly well in environments with poor Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR).\nAccuracy can be improved by 13.4% at an SNR of 12dB and 33.1% at 10dB,\nrespectively.",

While prior approaches such as iterative\nreward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they\ntypically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to\naccount for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work\nidentifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic\ngradient estimation due to static sampling strategies.

Our theoretical analysis shows that the\nproposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees\nunder suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that\nGVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over\nvanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be\nincorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO,\nleading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy.

      "abstract": "Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing\ndatasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to\nnoisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions\nand original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing\nmodels through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on\nrecognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to\nresolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by\nconstructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This\nincludes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the\noriginal-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to\nfurther enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models\nexhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,\nindependent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified\nguide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some\nchallenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified\ninstructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals\nwith positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model\ntraining using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision\neffectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training\ntasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to\nprovide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and\neffective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches.

Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation\ndistribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the\nhigh-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic\nrepresentation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the\nexisting works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause\ninsufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training\nobjective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation\ntensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive\nlearning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to\nimpose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen\nthe alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the\nBERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a\nlack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In\nresponse, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble\nmodels to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality\nof CLS Pooling.

Then, we\nprovide various polynomial time algorithms and hardness results for different\ncases in our theoretical study, including a fundamental result about\nWasserstein distance based polytope.",

Deep learning techniques have\ndemonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still\nface challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep\nlearning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices.\nOffloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of\ncommunication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the\ninference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for\nrecognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance\ninference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through\ndeep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy\nconsumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to\nachieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for\ncollaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been\nimplemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction.\nExperiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework\nsignificantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable\nrecognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and\npreventing plant diseases.",

We further introduce an autonomous planning framework\nthat completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the\nhypertree-structured planning outlines.

A simple and appealing account of what is distinctive of AI safety as\na field holds that this feature is constitutive: a research project falls\nwithin the purview of AI safety just in case it aims to prevent or reduce the\nharms caused by AI systems. Call this appealingly simple account The Safety\nConception of AI safety.

      "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on in-distribution (ID) data but\noften encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during deployment -- posing\nserious risks in safety-critical domains. Recent works have focused on\ndesigning scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty, with score thresholds\ntypically set based solely on ID data to achieve a target true positive rate\n(TPR), since OOD data is limited before deployment. However, these TPR-based\nthresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in\nhigh FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring\nfunctions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed,\nevolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \\emph{safely updates\nboth scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD\ninputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times,\neven as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR\ncontrol under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations\non OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing\nmethods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.",

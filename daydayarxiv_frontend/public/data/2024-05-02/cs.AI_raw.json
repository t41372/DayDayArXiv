    "abstract": "To deliver high-quality, personalized responses, large language models (LLMs)\nmust effectively incorporate context -- personal, demographic, and cultural\ninformation specific to an end-user. For example, asking the model to explain\nNewton's second law with the context \"I am a toddler\" should produce a response\ndifferent from when the context is \"I am a physics professor\". However,\nleveraging the context in practice is a nuanced and challenging task, and is\noften dependent on the specific situation or user base. The model must strike a\nbalance between providing specific, personalized responses and maintaining\ngeneral applicability. Current solutions, such as prompt-engineering and\nfine-tuning, require collection of contextually appropriate responses as\nexamples, making them time-consuming and less flexible to use across different\ncontexts. In this work, we introduce Context Steering (CoS) -- a simple,\ntraining-free decoding approach that amplifies the influence of the context in\nnext token predictions. CoS computes contextual influence by comparing the\noutput probabilities from two LLM forward passes: one that includes the context\nand one that does not. By linearly scaling the contextual influence, CoS allows\npractitioners to flexibly control the degree of personalization for different\nuse cases. We show that CoS can be applied to autoregressive LLMs, and\ndemonstrates strong performance in personalized recommendations. Additionally,\nwe show that CoS can function as a Bayesian Generative model to infer and\nquantify correlations between open-ended texts, broadening its potential\napplications.",

    "abstract": "To perform effective causal inference in high-dimensional datasets,\ninitiating the process with causal discovery is imperative, wherein a causal\ngraph is generated based on observational data. However, obtaining a complete\nand accurate causal graph poses a formidable challenge, recognized as an NP-\nhard problem. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered\nin a new era, indicating their emergent capabilities and widespread\napplicability in facilitating causal reasoning across diverse domains, such as\nmedicine, finance, and science. The expansive knowledge base of LLMs holds the\npotential to elevate the field of causal reasoning by offering\ninterpretability, making inferences, generalizability, and uncovering novel\ncausal structures. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, named\nAutonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework (ALCM), to synergize\ndata-driven causal discovery algorithms and LLMs, automating the generation of\na more resilient, accurate, and explicable causal graph. The ALCM consists of\nthree integral components: causal structure learning, causal wrapper, and\nLLM-driven causal refiner. These components autonomously collaborate within a\ndynamic environment to address causal discovery questions and deliver plausible\ncausal graphs. We evaluate the ALCM framework by implementing two\ndemonstrations on seven well-known datasets. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat ALCM outperforms existing LLM methods and conventional data-driven causal\nreasoning mechanisms. This study not only shows the effectiveness of the ALCM\nbut also underscores new research directions in leveraging the causal reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Reliability of AI systems is a fundamental concern for the successful\ndeployment and widespread adoption of AI technologies. Unfortunately, the\nescalating complexity and heterogeneity of AI hardware systems make them\nincreasingly susceptible to hardware faults, e.g., silent data corruptions\n(SDC), that can potentially corrupt model parameters. When this occurs during\nAI inference/servicing, it can potentially lead to incorrect or degraded model\noutput for users, ultimately affecting the quality and reliability of AI\nservices. In light of the escalating threat, it is crucial to address key\nquestions: How vulnerable are AI models to parameter corruptions, and how do\ndifferent components (such as modules, layers) of the models exhibit varying\nvulnerabilities to parameter corruptions? To systematically address this\nquestion, we propose a novel quantitative metric, Parameter Vulnerability\nFactor (PVF), inspired by architectural vulnerability factor (AVF) in computer\narchitecture community, aiming to standardize the quantification of AI model\nvulnerability against parameter corruptions. We define a model parameter's PVF\nas the probability that a corruption in that particular model parameter will\nresult in an incorrect output. In this paper, we present several use cases on\napplying PVF to three types of tasks/models during inference -- recommendation\n(DLRM), vision classification (CNN), and text classification (BERT), while\npresenting an in-depth vulnerability analysis on DLRM. PVF can provide pivotal\ninsights to AI hardware designers in balancing the tradeoff between fault\nprotection and performance/efficiency such as mapping vulnerable AI parameter\ncomponents to well-protected hardware modules. PVF metric is applicable to any\nAI model and has a potential to help unify and standardize AI\nvulnerability/resilience evaluation practice.",

Detecting DR at\nan advanced stage often results in irreversible blindness. The traditional\nprocess of diagnosing DR through retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is\nnot only time-intensive but also expensive. While classical transfer learning\nmodels have been widely adopted for computer-aided detection of DR, their high\nmaintenance costs can hinder their detection efficiency. In contrast, Quantum\nTransfer Learning offers a more effective solution to this challenge. This\napproach is notably advantageous because it operates on heuristic principles,\nmaking it highly optimized for the task. Our proposed methodology leverages\nthis hybrid quantum transfer learning technique to detect DR. To construct our\nmodel, we utilize the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset, available on\nKaggle. We employ the ResNet-18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152 and\nInception V3, pre-trained classical neural networks, for the initial feature\nextraction. For the classification stage, we use a Variational Quantum\nClassifier. Our hybrid quantum model has shown remarkable results, achieving an\naccuracy of 97% for ResNet-18.

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs),\nrepresenting a substantial medical challenge. The complexity of analyzing\ndiverse vital signs to predict sepsis further aggravates this issue. While deep\nlearning techniques have been advanced for early sepsis prediction, their\n'black-box' nature obscures the internal logic, impairing interpretability in\ncritical settings like ICUs. This paper introduces a framework that combines a\ndeep learning model with an attention mechanism that highlights the critical\ntime steps in the forecasting process, thus improving model interpretability\nand supporting clinical decision-making. We show that the attention mechanism\ncould be adapted to various black box time series forecasting models such as\nN-HiTS and N-BEATS. Our method preserves the accuracy of conventional deep\nlearning models while enhancing interpretability through\nattention-weight-generated heatmaps. We evaluated our model on the eICU-CRD\ndataset, focusing on forecasting vital signs for sepsis patients. We assessed\nits performance using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW)\nmetrics. We explored the attention maps of N-HiTS and N-BEATS, examining the\ndifferences in their performance and identifying crucial factors influencing\nvital sign forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Inherent bias within society can be amplified and perpetuated by artificial\nintelligence (AI) systems. To address this issue, a wide range of solutions\nhave been proposed to identify and mitigate bias and enforce fairness for\nindividuals and groups. Recently, Graph Laplacian Regularizer (GLR), a\nregularization technique from the semi-supervised learning literature has been\nused as a substitute for the common Lipschitz condition to enhance individual\nfairness. Notable prior work has shown that enforcing individual fairness\nthrough a GLR can improve the transfer learning accuracy of AI models under\ncovariate shifts. However, the prior work defines a GLR on the source and\ntarget data combined, implicitly assuming that the target data are available at\ntrain time, which might not hold in practice. In this work, we investigated\nwhether defining a GLR independently on the train and target data could\nmaintain similar accuracy. Furthermore, we introduced the Normalized Fairness\nGain score (NFG) to measure individual fairness by measuring the amount of\ngained fairness when a GLR is used versus not. We evaluated the new and\noriginal methods under NFG, the Prediction Consistency (PC), and traditional\nclassification metrics on the German Credit Approval dataset. The results\nshowed that the two models achieved similar statistical mean performances over\nfive-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the proposed metric showed that PC\nscores can be misleading as the scores can be high and statistically similar to\nfairness-enhanced models while NFG scores are small. This work therefore\nprovides new insights into when a GLR effectively enhances individual fairness\nand the pitfalls of PC.",

This underscores\nthe need for more adaptable, lightweight models. In response, this paper\nintroduces two innovative approaches that significantly enhance detection and\nsegmentation capabilities for small aerial objects. Firstly, we explore the use\nof the SAHI framework on the newly introduced lightweight YOLO v9 architecture,\nwhich utilizes Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) to reduce the\nsubstantial information loss typically encountered in sequential feature\nextraction processes. The paper employs the Vision Mamba model, which\nincorporates position embeddings to facilitate precise location-aware visual\nunderstanding, combined with a novel bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) for\neffective visual context modeling. This State Space Model adeptly harnesses the\nlinear complexity of CNNs and the global receptive field of Transformers,\nmaking it particularly effective in remote sensing image classification. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy\nand processing efficiency, validating the applicability of these approaches for\nreal-time small object detection across diverse aerial scenarios.

    "abstract": "Alignment is a standard procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language\nmodels (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI\nassistants. We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process\nfails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the\ngeneration of more false facts (i.e. hallucination). In this paper, we study\nhow to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying\nfactors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\\ supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we find that\ntraining the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can encourage\nhallucination. This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human labeled data\nthat may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL\ncan also encourage hallucination, because it guides the LLM to provide more\nhelpful responses on a diverse set of instructions, often preferring longer and\nmore detailed responses. Based on these observations, we propose\nfactuality-aware alignment, comprised of factuality-aware SFT and\nfactuality-aware RL through direct preference optimization. Experiments show\nthat our proposed factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual\nresponses while maintaining instruction-following capability.",

    "abstract": "Generalization to unseen data remains poorly understood for deep learning\nclassification and foundation models, especially in the open set scenario. How\ncan one assess the ability of networks to adapt to new or extended versions of\ntheir input space in the spirit of few-shot learning, out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, domain adaptation, and category discovery? Which layers of a\nnetwork are likely to generalize best? We provide a new method for evaluating\nthe capacity of networks to represent a sampled domain, regardless of whether\nthe network has been trained on all classes in that domain. Our approach is the\nfollowing: after fine-tuning state-of-the-art pre-trained models for visual\nclassification on a particular domain, we assess their performance on data from\nrelated but distinct variations in that domain. Generalization power is\nquantified as a function of the latent embeddings of unseen data from\nintermediate layers for both unsupervised and supervised settings. Working\nthroughout all stages of the network, we find that (i) high classification\naccuracy does not imply high generalizability; and (ii) deeper layers in a\nmodel do not always generalize the best, which has implications for pruning.\nSince the trends observed across datasets are largely consistent, we conclude\nthat our approach reveals (a function of) the intrinsic capacity of the\ndifferent layers of a model to generalize.

Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning\nRepresentation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks. We propose an AMR-driven\nchain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it\ngenerally hurts performance more than it helps. To investigate what AMR may\nhave to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments. We\nfind that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt\non, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and\nin the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the\nAMR to its prediction. We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in\nsemantic representations for LLMs. Our code:\nhttps://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.",

However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual\nlanguage tasks is yet to be improved. The existing LMMs like OpenFlamingo,\nEmu2, and Idefics gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on\nhundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from the web, which\nis neither efficient nor effective. In this paper, we aim to build strong\nmulti-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources.\nTherefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K\nmulti-image instruction data to train a family of Mantis models. The\ninstruction tuning empowers Mantis with different multi-image skills like\nco-reference, comparison, reasoning, and temporal understanding. We evaluate\nMantis on 8 multi-image benchmarks and 6 single-image benchmarks.\nMantis-Idefics2 can achieve SoTA results on all the multi-image benchmarks and\nbeat the strongest multi-image baseline, Idefics2-8B by an average of 13\nabsolute points. Notably, Idefics2-8B was pre-trained on 140M interleaved\nmulti-image data, which is 200x larger than Mantis-Instruct. We observe that\nMantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out benchmarks, which\nshows its generalization ability. We further evaluate Mantis on single-image\nbenchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis also maintains a strong single-image\nperformance on par with CogVLM and Emu2. Our results show that multi-image\nabilities are not necessarily gained through massive pre-training, instead,\nthey can be gained by low-cost instruction tuning.

The first approach is training-time\ndefense, such as adversarial training, which can mitigate poisoning effects but\nis computationally intensive. The other approach is pre-training purification,\ne.g., image short squeezing, which consists of several simple compressions but\noften encounters challenges in dealing with various UEs. Our work provides a\nnovel disentanglement mechanism to build an efficient pre-training purification\nmethod. Firstly, we uncover rate-constrained variational autoencoders (VAEs),\ndemonstrating a clear tendency to suppress the perturbations in UEs.

We introduce LambdaZero, a\ngenerative active learning approach to search for synthesizable molecules.\nPowered by deep reinforcement learning, LambdaZero learns to search over the\nvast space of molecules to discover candidates with a desired property. We\napply LambdaZero with molecular docking to design novel small molecules that\ninhibit the enzyme soluble Epoxide Hydrolase 2 (sEH), while enforcing\nconstraints on synthesizability and drug-likeliness. LambdaZero provides an\nexponential speedup in terms of the number of calls to the expensive molecular\ndocking oracle, and LambdaZero de novo designed molecules reach docking scores\nthat would otherwise require the virtual screening of a hundred billion\nmolecules. Importantly, LambdaZero discovers novel scaffolds of synthesizable,\ndrug-like inhibitors for sEH.

    "abstract": "Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of ball bearings is an active area\nof research, where novel machine learning techniques are continuously being\napplied to predict degradation trends and anticipate failures before they\noccur. However, few studies have explicitly addressed the challenge of handling\ncensored data, where information about a specific event (\\eg mechanical\nfailure) is incomplete or only partially observed. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a novel and flexible method for early fault detection using\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and RUL estimation using survival analysis\nthat naturally supports censored data. We demonstrate our approach in the\nXJTU-SY dataset using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy across three different\noperating conditions. When predicting the time to failure for bearings under\nthe highest load (C1, 12.0 kN and 2100 RPM) with 25% random censoring, our\napproach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.7 minutes (95% CI =\n13.6-15.8) using a linear CoxPH model, and an MAE of 12.6 minutes (95% CI =\n11.8-13.4) using a nonlinear Random Survival Forests model, compared to an MAE\nof 18.5 minutes (95% CI = 17.4-19.6) using a linear LASSO model that does not\nsupport censoring. Moreover, our approach achieves a mean cumulative relative\naccuracy (CRA) of 0.7586 over 5 bearings under the highest load, which improves\nover several state-of-the-art baselines. Our work highlights the importance of\nconsidering censored data as part of the model design when building predictive\nmodels for early fault detection and RUL estimation.",

Specifically, we\npropose to align 3D point clouds with LLMs using 2D priors from 2D-LLMs, which\ncan leverage the similarity between 2D and 3D visual information. We introduce\na novel four-stage training strategy for modality alignment in a cascaded way,\nand a mixture of query experts module to adaptively aggregate features with\nhigh efficiency. Moreover, we utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods\nLoRA and Norm fine-tuning, resulting in only 47.8M learnable parameters, which\nis up to 260x fewer than existing methods. Extensive experiments show that\nMiniGPT-3D achieves SOTA on 3D object classification and captioning tasks, with\nsignificantly cheaper training costs. Notably, MiniGPT-3D gains an 8.12\nincrease on GPT-4 evaluation score for the challenging object captioning task\ncompared to ShapeLLM-13B, while the latter costs 160 total GPU-hours on 8 A800.\nWe are the first to explore the efficient 3D-LLM, offering new insights to the\ncommunity.

Here, we present a rationale for why feminism remains deeply\nrelevant for AI research, rearticulate the original principles of data feminism\nwith respect to AI, and introduce two potential new principles related to\nenvironmental impact and consent. Together, these principles help to 1) account\nfor the unequal, undemocratic, extractive, and exclusionary forces at work in\nAI research, development, and deployment; 2) identify and mitigate predictable\nharms in advance of unsafe, discriminatory, or otherwise oppressive systems\nbeing released into the world; and 3) inspire creative, joyful, and collective\nways to work towards a more equitable, sustainable world in which all of us can\nthrive.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that existing Face Recognition Systems (FRS),\nincluding commercial ones, often exhibit biases toward certain ethnicities due\nto under-represented data. In this work, we explore ethnicity alteration and\nskin tone modification using synthetic face image generation methods to\nincrease the diversity of datasets. We conduct a detailed analysis by first\nconstructing a balanced face image dataset representing three ethnicities:\nAsian, Black, and Indian. We then make use of existing Generative Adversarial\nNetwork-based (GAN) image-to-image translation and manifold learning models to\nalter the ethnicity from one to another. A systematic analysis is further\nconducted to assess the suitability of such datasets for FRS by studying the\nrealistic skin-tone representation using Individual Typology Angle (ITA).\nFurther, we also analyze the quality characteristics using existing Face image\nquality assessment (FIQA) approaches. We then provide a holistic FRS\nperformance analysis using four different systems. Our findings pave the way\nfor future research works in (i) developing both specific ethnicity and general\n(any to any) ethnicity alteration models, (ii) expanding such approaches to\ncreate databases with diverse skin tones, (iii) creating datasets representing\nvarious ethnicities which further can help in mitigating bias while addressing\nprivacy concerns.",

    "abstract": "With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the\nevaluation of generative models has gained a lot of attention. Whereas most\ngenerative models are compared in terms of scalar values such as Frechet\nInception Distance (FID) or Inception Score (IS), in the last years (Sajjadi et\nal., 2018) proposed a definition of precision-recall curve to characterize the\ncloseness of two distributions. Since then, various approaches to precision and\nrecall have seen the light (Kynkaanniemi et al., 2019; Naeem et al., 2020; Park\n& Kim, 2023). They center their attention on the extreme values of precision\nand recall, but apart from this fact, their ties are elusive. In this paper, we\nunify most of these approaches under the same umbrella, relying on the work of\n(Simon et al., 2019). Doing so, we were able not only to recover entire curves,\nbut also to expose the sources of the accounted pitfalls of the concerned\nmetrics. We also provide consistency results that go well beyond the ones\npresented in the corresponding literature. Last, we study the different\nbehaviors of the curves obtained experimentally.",

For this we use a pre-trained AMR parser. We then\ntranslate the AMR graph into propositional logic and use a SAT solver for\nautomated reasoning. In text, often commonsense suggests that an entailment (or\ncontradiction) relationship holds between a premise and a claim, but because\ndifferent wordings are used, this is not identified from their logical\nrepresentations.

In particular, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient\n(GCG) attack has demonstrated efficacy in exploiting this vulnerability by\noptimizing adversarial prompts through a combination of gradient heuristics and\ngreedy search. However, the efficiency of this attack has become a bottleneck\nin the attacking process.

The automated segmentation of fractured bone from\ncomputed tomography (CT) scans remains challenging, due to the large\ndifferences of fractures in position and morphology, and also the inherent\nanatomical characteristics of different bone structures. To alleviate these\nissues, we propose a cross-scale attention mechanism as well as a surface\nsupervision strategy for fractured bone segmentation in CT. Specifically, a\ncross-scale attention mechanism is introduced to effectively aggregate the\nfeatures among different scales to provide more powerful fracture\nrepresentation.

The proposed method achieves an average DSC of 93.36%, ASSD of\n0.85mm, 95HD of 7.51mm.

Federated learning (FL) is a distributed\nmachine learning technique that facilitates this process while preserving data\nprivacy. However, FL also faces challenges such as high computational and\ncommunication costs regarding resource-constrained devices, and poor\ngeneralization performance due to the heterogeneity of data across edge clients\nand the presence of out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we propose the\nGradient-Congruity Guided Federated Sparse Training (FedSGC), a novel method\nthat integrates dynamic sparse training and gradient congruity inspection into\nfederated learning framework to address these issues. Our method leverages the\nidea that the neurons, in which the associated gradients with conflicting\ndirections with respect to the global model contain irrelevant or less\ngeneralized information for other clients, and could be pruned during the\nsparse training process. Conversely, the neurons where the associated gradients\nwith consistent directions could be grown in a higher priority. In this way,\nFedSGC can greatly reduce the local computation and communication overheads\nwhile, at the same time, enhancing the generalization abilities of FL.

This information is leveraged for procedural guidance,\ne.g., directing stent placements. To ensure procedural safety and efficacy,\nthere is a need for high robustness no failures during tracking. To achieve\nthat, one needs to efficiently tackle challenges, such as: device obscuration\nby contrast agent or other external devices or wires, changes in field-of-view\nor acquisition angle, as well as the continuous movement due to cardiac and\nrespiratory motion. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose a\nnovel approach to learn spatio-temporal features from a very large data cohort\nof over 16 million interventional X-ray frames using self-supervision for image\nsequence data. Our approach is based on a masked image modeling technique that\nleverages frame interpolation based reconstruction to learn fine inter-frame\ntemporal correspondences.

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and\nin particular robustness compared to ultra optimized reference solutions (that\nuse multi-stage feature fusion, multi-task and flow regularization). The\nexperiments show that our method achieves 66.31% reduction in maximum tracking\nerror against reference solutions (23.20% when flow regularization is used);\nachieving a success score of 97.95% at a 3x faster inference speed of 42\nframes-per-second (on GPU). The results encourage the use of our approach in\nvarious other tasks within interventional image analytics that require\neffective understanding of spatio-temporal semantics.",

    "abstract": "This work explores the hypothesis that subjectively attributed meaning\nconstitutes the phenomenal content of conscious experience. That is, phenomenal\ncontent is semantic. This form of subjective meaning manifests as an intrinsic\nand non-representational character of qualia. Empirically, subjective meaning\nis ubiquitous in conscious experiences. We point to phenomenological studies\nthat lend evidence to support this. Furthermore, this notion of meaning closely\nrelates to what Frege refers to as \"sense\", in metaphysics and philosophy of\nlanguage. It also aligns with Peirce's \"interpretant\", in semiotics. We discuss\nhow Frege's sense can also be extended to the raw feels of consciousness. Sense\nand reference both play a role in phenomenal experience. Moreover, within the\ncontext of the mind-matter relation, we provide a formalization of subjective\nmeaning associated to one's mental representations. Identifying the precise\nmaps between the physical and mental domains, we argue that syntactic and\nsemantic structures transcend language, and are realized within each of these\ndomains. Formally, meaning is a relational attribute, realized via a map that\ninterprets syntactic structures of a formal system within an appropriate\nsemantic space. The image of this map within the mental domain is what is\nrelevant for experience, and thus comprises the phenomenal content of qualia.\nWe conclude with possible implications this may have for experience-based\ntheories of consciousness.",

In this paper, we challenge this belief: does the\nglobalizing property always benefit Graph Transformers? We reveal the\nover-globalizing problem in Graph Transformer by presenting both empirical\nevidence and theoretical analysis, i.e., the current attention mechanism overly\nfocuses on those distant nodes, while the near nodes, which actually contain\nmost of the useful information, are relatively weakened.

In this paper, we introduce two\nnovel poisoning attacks on FL tailored to regression tasks within autonomous\ndriving: FLStealth and Off-Track Attack (OTA). FLStealth, an untargeted attack,\naims at providing model updates that deteriorate the global model performance\nwhile appearing benign.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks by conducting\ncomprehensive experiments pertaining to the task of vehicle trajectory\nprediction. In particular, we show that, among five different untargeted\nattacks, FLStealth is the most successful at bypassing the considered defenses\nemployed by the server.

    "abstract": "Simulating soil reflectance spectra is invaluable for soil-plant radiative\nmodeling and training machine learning models, yet it is difficult as the\nintricate relationships between soil structure and its constituents. To address\nthis, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of\nsoil reflectance spectra based on soil property inputs was developed. The model\nis trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil\nspectra-property pairs from 17 datasets. It generates soil reflectance spectra\nfrom text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than\nonly numerical values and labels in binary vector format. The generative model\ncan simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties.\nSOGM is based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Two\nadditional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral\npadding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the full\nvisible-near-infrared range (VIS-NIR; 400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra\nmodel that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance\nspectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM. The SOGM was up-scaled by\ncoupling with the Helios 3D plant modeling software, which allowed for\ngeneration of synthetic aerial images of simulated soil and plant scenes. It\ncan also be easily integrated with soil-plant radiation model used for remote\nsensin research like PROSAIL. The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets\nthat not included in model training proved that the model can generate\nreasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs.

However, the existing prediction methods suffer from\nlow prediction accuracy with the lack of spatial-temporal correlation features\nrelated to parking volume, and neglect of flow patterns and correlations\nbetween similar parking lots within certain areas. To address these challenges,\nthis study proposes a parking availability prediction framework integrating\nspatial-temporal deep learning with multi-source data fusion, encompassing\ntraffic demand data from multiple sources (e.g., metro, bus, taxi services),\nand parking lot data. The framework is based on the Transformer as the\nspatial-temporal deep learning model and leverages K-means clustering to\nestablish parking cluster zones, extracting and integrating traffic demand\ncharacteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online\nride-hailing, and taxi) connected to parking lots. Real-world empirical data\nwas used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with\ndifferent machine learning, deep learning, and traditional statistical models\nfor predicting parking availability. Experimental results reveal that, with the\nproposed pipeline, the developed Transformer model outperforms other models in\nterms of various metrics, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By fusing multi-source\ndemanding data with spatial-temporal deep learning techniques, this approach\noffers the potential to develop parking availability prediction systems that\nfurnish more accurate and timely information to both drivers and urban\nplanners, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility.",

We propose that such a representation or model should\npossess universality, characterized by: (i) discriminability: performing well\non training samples; (ii) generalization: performing well on unseen datasets;\nand (iii) transferability: performing well on unseen tasks with distribution\nshifts. Despite its importance, current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods\nlack explicit modeling of universality, and theoretical analysis remains\nunderexplored. To address these issues, we aim to explore and incorporate\nuniversality into SSL. Specifically, we first revisit SSL from a task\nperspective and find that each mini-batch can be viewed as a multi-class\nclassification task. We then propose that a universal SSL model should achieve:\n(i) learning universality by minimizing loss across all training samples, and\n(ii) evaluation universality by learning causally invariant representations\nthat generalize well to unseen tasks. To quantify this, we introduce a\n$\\sigma$-measurement that assesses the gap between the performance of SSL model\nand optimal task-specific models. Furthermore, to model universality, we\npropose the GeSSL framework. It first learns task-specific models by minimizing\nSSL loss, then incorporates future updates to enhance discriminability, and\nfinally integrates these models to learn from multiple tasks. Theoretical and\nempirical evidence supports the effectiveness of GeSSL.",

Despite the ubiquitous relevance of such settings, decentralized\nmachine learning algorithms have struggled to find equilibria that maximize\nindividual utility while preserving social welfare. In this paper we introduce\nLearning with Opponent Q-Learning Awareness (LOQA), a novel, decentralized\nreinforcement learning algorithm tailored to optimizing an agent's individual\nutility while fostering cooperation among adversaries in partially competitive\nenvironments.

However, their deep and\nbulky architecture incurs substantial amounts of backpropagation memory and\ncomputing latency. Consequently, the problem poses an unavoidable bottleneck in\nconstructing high-resolution (HR) BEV maps, as their large-sized features cause\nsignificant increases in costs including GPU memory consumption and computing\nlatency, named diverging training costs issue. Affected by the problem, most\nexisting methods adopt low-resolution (LR) BEV and struggle to estimate the\nprecise locations of urban scene components like road lanes, and sidewalks. As\nthe imprecision leads to risky motion planning like collision avoidance, the\ndiverging training costs issue has to be resolved. In this paper, we address\nthe issue with our novel BEVRestore mechanism. Specifically, our proposed model\nencodes the features of each sensor to LR BEV space and restores them to HR\nspace to establish a memory-efficient map constructor. To this end, we\nintroduce the BEV restoration strategy, which restores aliasing, and blocky\nartifacts of the up-scaled BEV features, and narrows down the width of the\nlabels.

    "abstract": "Recent transformer-based ASR models have achieved word-error rates (WER)\nbelow 4%, surpassing human annotator accuracy, yet they demand extensive server\nresources, contributing to significant carbon footprints. The traditional\nserver-based architecture of ASR also presents privacy concerns, alongside\nreliability and latency issues due to network dependencies. In contrast,\non-device (edge) ASR enhances privacy, boosts performance, and promotes\nsustainability by effectively balancing energy use and accuracy for specific\napplications. This study examines the effects of quantization, memory demands,\nand energy consumption on the performance of various ASR model inference on the\nNVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. By analyzing WER and transcription speed across models\nusing FP32, FP16, and INT8 quantization on clean and noisy datasets, we\nhighlight the crucial trade-offs between accuracy, speeds, quantization, energy\nefficiency, and memory needs. We found that changing precision from fp32 to\nfp16 halves the energy consumption for audio transcription across different\nmodels, with minimal performance degradation. A larger model size and number of\nparameters neither guarantees better resilience to noise, nor predicts the\nenergy consumption for a given transcription load. These, along with several\nother findings offer novel insights for optimizing ASR systems within energy-\nand memory-limited environments, crucial for the development of efficient\non-device ASR solutions.

While large language models (LLMs) enable fully natural\nlanguage (NL) PE dialogues, we hypothesize that monolithic LLM NL-PE approaches\nlack the multi-turn, decision-theoretic reasoning required to effectively\nbalance the exploration and exploitation of user preferences towards an\narbitrary item set. In contrast, traditional Bayesian optimization PE methods\ndefine theoretically optimal PE strategies, but cannot generate arbitrary NL\nqueries or reason over content in NL item descriptions -- requiring users to\nexpress preferences via ratings or comparisons of unfamiliar items. To overcome\nthe limitations of both approaches, we formulate NL-PE in a Bayesian\nOptimization (BO) framework that seeks to actively elicit NL feedback to\nidentify the best recommendation. Key challenges in generalizing BO to deal\nwith natural language feedback include determining: (a) how to leverage LLMs to\nmodel the likelihood of NL preference feedback as a function of item utilities,\nand (b) how to design an acquisition function for NL BO that can elicit\npreferences in the infinite space of language. We demonstrate our framework in\na novel NL-PE algorithm, PEBOL, which uses: 1) Natural Language Inference (NLI)\nbetween user preference utterances and NL item descriptions to maintain\nBayesian preference beliefs, and 2) BO strategies such as Thompson Sampling\n(TS) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to steer LLM query generation. We\nnumerically evaluate our methods in controlled simulations, finding that after\n10 turns of dialogue, PEBOL can achieve an MRR@10 of up to 0.27 compared to the\nbest monolithic LLM baseline's MRR@10 of 0.17, despite relying on earlier and\nsmaller LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great performance in various tasks,\nwith the core idea of learning from data labels and aggregating messages within\nthe neighborhood of nodes. However, the common challenges in graphs are\ntwofold: insufficient accurate (high-quality) labels and limited neighbors for\nnodes, resulting in weak GNNs. Existing graph augmentation methods typically\naddress only one of these challenges, often adding training costs or relying on\noversimplified or knowledge-intensive strategies, limiting their\ngeneralization. To simultaneously address both challenges faced by graphs in a\ngeneralized way, we propose an elegant method called IntraMix. Considering the\nincompatibility of vanilla Mixup with the complex topology of graphs, IntraMix\ninnovatively employs Mixup among inaccurate labeled data of the same class,\ngenerating high-quality labeled data at minimal cost. Additionally, it finds\ndata with high confidence of being clustered into the same group as the\ngenerated data to serve as their neighbors, thereby enriching the neighborhoods\nof graphs. IntraMix efficiently tackles both issues faced by graphs and\nchallenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node\nclassification. IntraMix is a theoretically grounded plug-in-play method that\ncan be readily applied to all GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of IntraMix across various GNNs and datasets.

    "abstract": "Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) play a central role in modeling\nsequential decision making problems under an instantaneous activation\nconstraint that at most B arms can be activated at any decision epoch. Each\nrestless arm is endowed with a state that evolves independently according to a\nMarkov decision process regardless of being activated or not. In this paper, we\nconsider the task of learning in episodic RMAB with unknown transition\nfunctions and adversarial rewards, which can change arbitrarily across\nepisodes. Further, we consider a challenging but natural bandit feedback\nsetting that only adversarial rewards of activated arms are revealed to the\ndecision maker (DM). The goal of the DM is to maximize its total adversarial\nrewards during the learning process while the instantaneous activation\nconstraint must be satisfied in each decision epoch. We develop a novel\nreinforcement learning algorithm with two key contributors: a novel biased\nadversarial reward estimator to deal with bandit feedback and unknown\ntransitions, and a low-complexity index policy to satisfy the instantaneous\nactivation constraint. We show $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound\nfor our algorithm, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the episode\nlength. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for adversarial RMAB in our considered\nchallenging settings.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to maximize the SSR for heterogeneous service demands\nin the cooperative MEC-assisted RAN slicing system by jointly considering the\nmulti-node computing resources cooperation and allocation, the transmission\nresource blocks (RBs) allocation, and the time-varying dynamicity of the\nsystem. To this end, we abstract the system into a weighted undirected topology\ngraph and, then propose a recurrent graph reinforcement learning (RGRL)\nalgorithm to intelligently learn the optimal hybrid RA policy. Therein, the\ngraph neural network (GCN) and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is\ncombined to effectively extract spatial features from the equivalent topology\ngraph. Furthermore, a novel time recurrent reinforcement learning framework is\ndesigned in the proposed RGRL algorithm by incorporating the action output of\nthe policy network at the previous moment into the state input of the policy\nnetwork at the subsequent moment, so as to cope with the time-varying and\ncontextual network environment. In addition, we explore two use case scenarios\nto discuss the universal superiority of the proposed RGRL algorithm. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of the\naverage SSR, the performance stability, and the network complexity.",

    "abstract": "We present EchoScene, an interactive and controllable generative model that\ngenerates 3D indoor scenes on scene graphs. EchoScene leverages a dual-branch\ndiffusion model that dynamically adapts to scene graphs. Existing methods\nstruggle to handle scene graphs due to varying numbers of nodes, multiple edge\ncombinations, and manipulator-induced node-edge operations. EchoScene overcomes\nthis by associating each node with a denoising process and enables\ncollaborative information exchange, enhancing controllable and consistent\ngeneration aware of global constraints. This is achieved through an information\necho scheme in both shape and layout branches. At every denoising step, all\nprocesses share their denoising data with an information exchange unit that\ncombines these updates using graph convolution. The scheme ensures that the\ndenoising processes are influenced by a holistic understanding of the scene\ngraph, facilitating the generation of globally coherent scenes. The resulting\nscenes can be manipulated during inference by editing the input scene graph and\nsampling the noise in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate our\napproach, which maintains scene controllability and surpasses previous methods\nin generation fidelity. Moreover, the generated scenes are of high quality and\nthus directly compatible with off-the-shelf texture generation. Code and\ntrained models are open-sourced.",

    "abstract": "This document presents the Center for Robot Assisted Search And Rescue -\nUncrewed Aerial Systems - Disaster Response Overhead Inspection Dataset\n(CRASAR-U-DROIDs) for building damage assessment and spatial alignment\ncollected from small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) geospatial imagery. This\ndataset is motivated by the increasing use of sUAS in disaster response and the\nlack of previous work in utilizing high-resolution geospatial sUAS imagery for\nmachine learning and computer vision models, the lack of alignment with\noperational use cases, and with hopes of enabling further investigations\nbetween sUAS and satellite imagery. The CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset consists of\nfifty-two (52) orthomosaics from ten (10) federally declared disasters\n(Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane\nLaura, Hurricane Michael, Musset Bayou Fire, Mayfield Tornado, Kilauea\nEruption, and Champlain Towers Collapse) spanning 67.98 square kilometers\n(26.245 square miles), containing 21,716 building polygons and damage labels,\nand 7,880 adjustment annotations. The imagery was tiled and presented in\nconjunction with overlaid building polygons to a pool of 130 annotators who\nprovided human judgments of damage according to the Joint Damage Scale. These\nannotations were then reviewed via a two-stage review process in which building\npolygon damage labels were first reviewed individually and then again by\ncommittee. Additionally, the building polygons have been aligned spatially to\nprecisely overlap with the imagery to enable more performant machine learning\nmodels to be trained. It appears that CRASAR-U-DRIODs is the largest labeled\ndataset of sUAS orthomosaic imagery.",

SNNs, known for their efficiency over Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs), have not been analyzed for their applicability in VFL, thus far. In\nthis paper, we investigate the benefits and trade-offs of using SNN models in a\nvertical federated learning setting. We implement two different federated\nlearning architectures -- with model splitting and without model splitting --\nthat have different privacy and performance implications. We evaluate the setup\nusing CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmark datasets along with SNN implementations\nof VGG9 and ResNET classification models.

Current data-driven models often struggle with data\nsparsity and typically overlook the integration of diverse urban data sources\nand the high-order dependencies within them. Additionally, they frequently rely\non predefined topologies or weights, limiting their adaptability in\nspatiotemporal predictions. To address these issues, we introduce the\nSpatiotemporal Multiview Adaptive HyperGraph Learning (SMA-Hyper) model, a\ndynamic deep learning framework designed for traffic accident prediction.\nBuilding on previous research, this innovative model incorporates dual adaptive\nspatiotemporal graph learning mechanisms that enable high-order cross-regional\nlearning through hypergraphs and dynamic adaptation to evolving urban data. It\nalso utilises contrastive learning to enhance global and local data\nrepresentations in sparse datasets and employs an advance attention mechanism\nto fuse multiple views of accident data and urban functional features, thereby\nenriching the contextual understanding of risk factors. Extensive testing on\nthe London traffic accident dataset demonstrates that the SMA-Hyper model\nsignificantly outperforms baseline models across various temporal horizons and\nmultistep outputs, affirming the effectiveness of its multiview fusion and\nadaptive learning strategies.

Accelerating\nlesion detection from DBT using deep learning is hindered by limited data\navailability and huge annotation costs. A possible solution to this issue could\nbe to leverage the information provided by a more widely available modality,\nsuch as mammography, to enhance DBT lesion detection. In this paper, we present\na novel framework, CoMoTo, for improving lesion detection in DBT. Our framework\nleverages unpaired mammography data to enhance the training of a DBT model,\nimproving practicality by eliminating the need for mammography during\ninference. Specifically, we propose two novel components, Lesion-specific\nKnowledge Distillation (LsKD) and Intra-modal Point Alignment (ImPA). LsKD\nselectively distills lesion features from a mammography teacher model to a DBT\nstudent model, disregarding background features. ImPA further enriches LsKD by\nensuring the alignment of lesion features within the teacher before distilling\nknowledge to the student. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CoMoTo is\nsuperior to traditional pretraining and image-level KD, improving performance\nby 7% Mean Sensitivity under low-data setting.

Based on a total of 57,648 instance\nsegmented images obtained from a total of 924 annotators and 34 QA workers from\nfour annotation companies and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we derived the\nfollowing insights: (1) Annotation companies perform better both in terms of\nquantity and quality compared to the widely used platform MTurk. (2) Annotation\ncompanies' internal QA only provides marginal improvements, if any. However,\nimproving labeling instructions instead of investing in QA can substantially\nboost annotation performance. (3) The benefit of internal QA depends on\nspecific image characteristics.

    "abstract": "Urban areas, as the primary human habitat in modern civilization, accommodate\na broad spectrum of social activities. With the surge of embodied intelligence,\nrecent years have witnessed an increasing presence of physical agents in urban\nareas, such as autonomous vehicles and delivery robots. As a result,\npractitioners significantly value crafting authentic, simulation-ready 3D\ncities to facilitate the training and verification of such agents. However,\nthis task is quite challenging. Current generative methods fall short in either\ndiversity, controllability, or fidelity. In this work, we resort to the\nprocedural content generation (PCG) technique for high-fidelity generation. It\nassembles superior assets according to empirical rules, ultimately leading to\nindustrial-grade outcomes. To ensure diverse and self contained creation, we\ndesign a management protocol to accommodate extensive PCG plugins with distinct\nfunctions and interfaces. Based on this unified PCG library, we develop a\nmulti-agent framework to transform multi-modal instructions, including OSM,\nsemantic maps, and satellite images, into executable programs. The programs\ncoordinate relevant plugins to construct the 3D city consistent with the\ncontrol condition. A visual feedback scheme is introduced to further refine the\ninitial outcomes.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) enables social robots to generate trajectories\nwithout relying on human-designed rules or interventions, making it generally\nmore effective than rule-based systems in adapting to complex, dynamic\nreal-world scenarios. However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that\nrequires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians, whereas existing RL-based\nsolutions often fall short of ensuring safety in complex environments. In this\npaper, we propose SoNIC, which to the best of our knowledge is the first\nalgorithm that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained\nreinforcement learning (CRL) to enable safe policy learning for social\nnavigation. Specifically, our method not only augments RL observations with\nACI-generated nonconformity scores, which inform the agent of the quantified\nuncertainty but also employs these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide\nthe behaviors of RL agents by using constrained reinforcement learning. This\nintegration regulates the behaviors of RL agents and enables them to handle\nsafety-critical situations. On the standard CrowdNav benchmark, our method\nachieves a success rate of 96.93%, which is 11.67% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art RL method and results in 4.5 times fewer collisions and 2.8\ntimes fewer intrusions to ground-truth human future trajectories as well as\nenhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. To further validate our\napproach, we deploy our algorithm on a real robot by developing a ROS2-based\nnavigation system. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can generate\nrobust and socially polite decision-making when interacting with both sparse\nand dense crowds.

    "abstract": "Many publicly available language models have been safety tuned to reduce the\nlikelihood of toxic or liability-inducing text. To redteam or jailbreak these\nmodels for compliance with toxic requests, users and security analysts have\ndeveloped adversarial prompting techniques. One attack method is to apply\ndiscrete optimization techniques to the prompt. However, the resulting attack\nstrings are often gibberish text, easily filtered by defenders due to high\nmeasured perplexity, and may fail for unseen tasks and/or well-tuned models. In\nthis work, we improve existing algorithms (primarily GCG and BEAST) to develop\npowerful and fluent attacks on safety-tuned models like Llama-2 and Phi-3. Our\ntechnique centers around a new distillation-based approach that encourages the\nvictim model to emulate a toxified finetune, either in terms of output\nprobabilities or internal activations. To encourage human-fluent attacks, we\nadd a multi-model perplexity penalty and a repetition penalty to the objective.\nWe also enhance optimizer strength by allowing token insertions, token swaps,\nand token deletions and by using longer attack sequences. The resulting process\nis able to reliably jailbreak the most difficult target models with prompts\nthat appear similar to human-written prompts. On Advbench we achieve attack\nsuccess rates $>93$% for Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Vicuna-7B, while\nmaintaining model-measured perplexity $<33$; we achieve $95$% attack success\nfor Phi-3, though with higher perplexity. We also find a universally-optimized\nsingle fluent prompt that induces $>88$% compliance on previously unseen tasks\nacross Llama-2-7B, Phi-3-mini and Vicuna-7B and transfers to other black-box\nmodels.",

While recent approaches yield impressive results using high-quality\ntraining data, the inaccessibility of these datasets hampers fair and\ntransparent benchmarking. Moreover, these approaches prioritize 2D human motion\nand overlook the significance of camera motions in videos, leading to limited\ncontrol and unstable video generation. To demystify the training data, we\npresent HumanVid, the first large-scale high-quality dataset tailored for human\nimage animation, which combines crafted real-world and synthetic data. For the\nreal-world data, we compile a vast collection of real-world videos from the\ninternet. We developed and applied careful filtering rules to ensure video\nquality, resulting in a curated collection of 20K high-resolution (1080P)\nhuman-centric videos. Human and camera motion annotation is accomplished using\na 2D pose estimator and a SLAM-based method. To expand our synthetic dataset,\nwe collected 10K 3D avatar assets and leveraged existing assets of body shapes,\nskin textures and clothings. Notably, we introduce a rule-based camera\ntrajectory generation method, enabling the synthetic pipeline to incorporate\ndiverse and precise camera motion annotation, which can rarely be found in\nreal-world data. To verify the effectiveness of HumanVid, we establish a\nbaseline model named CamAnimate, short for Camera-controllable Human Animation,\nthat considers both human and camera motions as conditions. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we demonstrate that such simple baseline training on our\nHumanVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling both human pose\nand camera motions, setting a new benchmark.

    "abstract": "Developing models that can learn to reason is a notoriously challenging\nproblem. We focus on reasoning in relational domains, where the use of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) seems like a natural choice. However, previous work has\nshown that regular GNNs lack the ability to systematically generalize from\ntraining examples on test graphs requiring longer inference chains, which\nfundamentally limits their reasoning abilities. A common solution relies on\nneuro-symbolic methods that systematically reason by learning rules, but their\nscalability is often limited and they tend to make unrealistically strong\nassumptions, e.g.\\ that the answer can always be inferred from a single\nrelational path. We propose the Epistemic GNN (EpiGNN), a novel\nparameter-efficient and scalable GNN architecture with an epistemic inductive\nbias for systematic reasoning. Node embeddings in EpiGNNs are treated as\nepistemic states, and message passing is implemented accordingly. We show that\nEpiGNNs achieve state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks that require\nsystematic reasoning. Furthermore, for inductive knowledge graph completion,\nEpiGNNs rival the performance of state-of-the-art specialized approaches.\nFinally, we introduce two new benchmarks that go beyond standard relational\nreasoning by requiring the aggregation of information from multiple paths.\nHere, existing neuro-symbolic approaches fail, yet EpiGNNs learn to reason\naccurately.

    "abstract": "There has been significant recent interest in harnessing LLMs to control\nsoftware systems through multi-step reasoning, planning and tool-usage. While\nsome promising results have been obtained, application to specific domains\nraises several general issues including the control of specialized domain\ntools, the lack of existing datasets for training and evaluation, and the\nnon-triviality of automated system evaluation and improvement. In this paper,\nwe present a case-study where we examine these issues in the context of a\nspecific domain. Specifically, we present an automated math visualizer and\nsolver system for mathematical pedagogy. The system orchestrates mathematical\nsolvers and math graphing tools to produce accurate visualizations from simple\nnatural language commands. We describe the creation of specialized data-sets,\nand also develop an auto-evaluator to easily evaluate the outputs of our system\nby comparing them to ground-truth expressions.

Existing methods often rely on fixed temporal windows for video\nanalysis to identify dynamic surgical phases. Thus, they struggle to\nsimultaneously capture short-, mid-, and long-term information necessary to\nfully understand complex surgical procedures. To address these issues, we\npropose Multi-Scale Transformers for Surgical Phase Recognition (MuST), a novel\nTransformer-based approach that combines a Multi-Term Frame encoder with a\nTemporal Consistency Module to capture information across multiple temporal\nscales of a surgical video. Our Multi-Term Frame Encoder computes\ninterdependencies across a hierarchy of temporal scales by sampling sequences\nat increasing strides around the frame of interest. Furthermore, we employ a\nlong-term Transformer encoder over the frame embeddings to further enhance\nlong-term reasoning.

We explored\nthe capabilities of these models in analyzing complex charts and assessing the\nimpact of different prompting strategies on the models' analyses.

Through three experiments--from initial exploration to detailed\nanalysis--we progressively gained insights into how to effectively prompt LLMs\nto identify misleading charts and developed strategies to address the\nscalability challenges encountered as we expanded our detection range from the\ninitial five issues to 21 issues in the final experiment. Our findings reveal\nthat multimodal LLMs possess a strong capability for chart comprehension and\ncritical thinking in data interpretation.

Traditional\nstudies have typically approached this task as a discriminative problem,\nmatching the text and image via the cross-attention mechanism (one-tower\nframework) or in a common embedding space (two-tower framework). Recently,\ngenerative cross-modal retrieval has emerged as a new research line, which\nassigns images with unique string identifiers and generates the target\nidentifier as the retrieval target. Despite its great potential, existing\ngenerative approaches are limited due to the following issues: insufficient\nvisual information in identifiers, misalignment with high-level semantics, and\nlearning gap towards the retrieval target. To address the above issues, we\npropose an autoregressive voken generation method, named AVG. AVG tokenizes\nimages into vokens, i.e., visual tokens, and innovatively formulates the\ntext-to-image retrieval task as a token-to-voken generation problem. AVG\ndiscretizes an image into a sequence of vokens as the identifier of the image,\nwhile maintaining the alignment with both the visual information and high-level\nsemantics of the image. Additionally, to bridge the learning gap between\ngenerative training and the retrieval target, we incorporate discriminative\ntraining to modify the learning direction during token-to-voken training.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that AVG achieves superior results in both\neffectiveness and efficiency.",

Imaging biomarkers obtained from\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can predict the functional recovery of\nindividuals with SCI and help choose the optimal treatment strategy. Currently,\nmost studies employ manual quantification of these MRI-derived biomarkers,\nwhich is a subjective and tedious task.

Tissue bridges quantified\nautomatically did not significantly differ from those computed manually,\nsuggesting that the proposed automatic tool can be used to derive relevant MRI\nbiomarkers. \\texttt{SCIsegV2} and the automatic tissue bridges computation are\nopen-source and available in Spinal Cord Toolbox (v6.4 and above) via the\n\\texttt{sct\\_deepseg -task seg\\_sc\\_lesion\\_t2w\\_sci} and\n\\texttt{sct\\_analyze\\_lesion} functions, respectively.",

A dataset of 400 30-second video segments from German classrooms was\nconstructed for model training and validation. The gesture intensity regressor\nachieved a correlation of 0.84, the perceived distance regressor 0.55, and the\nNVI model 0.44 with median human ratings. The model demonstrates the potential\nto provide a valuable support in nonverbal behavior assessment, approximating\nthe accuracy of individual human raters. Validated against both questionnaire\ndata and trained observer ratings, our models show moderate to strong\ncorrelations with relevant educational outcomes, indicating their efficacy in\nreflecting effective teaching behaviors. This research advances the objective\nassessment of nonverbal communication behaviors, opening new pathways for\neducational research.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as\nautonomous vehicles, robotics and augmented reality. However, training 3D\ndetectors requires a costly precise annotation, which is a hindrance to scaling\nannotation to large datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a weakly\nsupervised 3D annotator that relies solely on 2D bounding box annotations from\nimages, along with size priors. One major problem is that supervising a 3D\ndetection model using only 2D boxes is not reliable due to ambiguities between\ndifferent 3D poses and their identical 2D projection. We introduce a simple yet\neffective and generic solution: we build 3D proxy objects with annotations by\nconstruction and add them to the training dataset. Our method requires only\nsize priors to adapt to new classes. To better align 2D supervision with 3D\ndetection, our method ensures depth invariance with a novel expression of the\n2D losses. Finally, to detect more challenging instances, our annotator follows\nan offline pseudo-labelling scheme which gradually improves its 3D\npseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our\nmethod not only performs on-par or above previous works on the Car category,\nbut also achieves performance close to fully supervised methods on more\nchallenging classes. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of\nour method by being the first to experiment on the more challenging nuScenes\ndataset. We additionally propose a setting where weak labels are obtained from\na 2D detector pre-trained on MS-COCO instead of human annotations. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/CEA-LIST/ALPI",

However, understanding the mechanisms that\ndictate continual performance in this paradigm remains elusive. To tackle this\ncomplexity, we undertake a rigorous analysis of PEFT-CL dynamics to derive\nrelevant metrics for continual scenarios using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)\ntheory. With the aid of NTK as a mathematical analysis tool, we recast the\nchallenge of test-time forgetting into the quantifiable generalization gaps\nduring training, identifying three key factors that influence these gaps and\nthe performance of PEFT-CL: training sample size, task-level feature\northogonality, and regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce\nNTK-CL, a novel framework that eliminates task-specific parameter storage while\nadaptively generating task-relevant features. Aligning with theoretical\nguidance, NTK-CL triples the feature representation of each sample,\ntheoretically and empirically reducing the magnitude of both task-interplay and\ntask-specific generalization gaps. Grounded in NTK analysis, our approach\nimposes an adaptive exponential moving average mechanism and constraints on\ntask-level feature orthogonality, maintaining intra-task NTK forms while\nattenuating inter-task NTK forms. Ultimately, by fine-tuning optimizable\nparameters with appropriate regularization, NTK-CL achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on established PEFT-CL benchmarks.

    "abstract": "We introduce a dataset of annotations of temporal repetitions in videos. The\ndataset, OVR (pronounced as over), contains annotations for over 72K videos,\nwith each annotation specifying the number of repetitions, the start and end\ntime of the repetitions, and also a free-form description of what is repeating.\nThe annotations are provided for videos sourced from Kinetics and Ego4D, and\nconsequently cover both Exo and Ego viewing conditions, with a huge variety of\nactions and activities. Moreover, OVR is almost an order of magnitude larger\nthan previous datasets for video repetition. We also propose a baseline\ntransformer-based counting model, OVRCounter, that can localise and count\nrepetitions in videos that are up to 320 frames long. The model is trained and\nevaluated on the OVR dataset, and its performance assessed with and without\nusing text to specify the target class to count. The performance is also\ncompared to a prior repetition counting model. The dataset is available for\ndownload at: https://sites.google.com/view/openvocabreps/",

    "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) achieves remarkable\nperformance in various downstream tasks through the alignment of image and text\ninput embeddings and holds great promise for anomaly detection. However, our\nempirical experiments show that the embeddings of text inputs unexpectedly\ntightly cluster together, far away from image embeddings, contrary to the\nmodel's contrastive training objective to align image-text input pairs. We show\nthat this phenomenon induces a `similarity bias' - in which false negative and\nfalse positive errors occur due to bias in the similarities between images and\nthe normal label text embeddings. To address this bias, we propose a novel\nmethodology called BLISS which directly accounts for this similarity bias\nthrough the use of an auxiliary, external set of text inputs. BLISS is simple,\nit does not require strong inductive biases about anomalous behaviour nor an\nexpensive training process, and it significantly outperforms baseline methods\non benchmark image datasets, even when access to normal data is extremely\nlimited.",

    "abstract": "Temporal networks are effective in capturing the evolving interactions of\nnetworks over time, such as social networks and e-commerce networks. In recent\nyears, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model\narchitectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve\nthe representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited\nattention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training\nof TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two\nspecific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive\nshift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample\namidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift\nrelates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To\nrobustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum\nNegative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that\nadaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework,\nwe first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random,\nhistorical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive\nsparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module\nthat focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active\nedges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Extensive experiments on\n12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline\nmethods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and\nparameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our\napproach. Our code is available at https://github.com/zziyue83/CurNM.",

However, in widely used\nsecurity platforms like NVD, a substantial number of CVE records still lack\ntrace links to patches. Although rank-based approaches have been proposed for\nsecurity patch tracing, they heavily rely on handcrafted features in a\nsingle-step framework, which limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we\npropose PatchFinder, a two-phase framework with end-to-end correlation learning\nfor better-tracing security patches. In the **initial retrieval** phase, we\nemploy a hybrid patch retriever to account for both lexical and semantic\nmatching based on the code changes and the description of a CVE, to narrow down\nthe search space by extracting those commits as candidates that are similar to\nthe CVE descriptions. Afterwards, in the **re-ranking** phase, we design an\nend-to-end architecture under the supervised fine-tuning paradigm for learning\nthe semantic correlations between CVE descriptions and commits. In this way, we\ncan automatically rank the candidates based on their correlation scores while\nmaintaining low computation overhead. We evaluated our system against 4,789\nCVEs from 532 OSS projects. The results are highly promising: PatchFinder\nachieves a Recall@10 of 80.63% and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.7951.\nMoreover, the Manual Effort@10 required is curtailed to 2.77, marking a 1.94\ntimes improvement over current leading methods. When applying PatchFinder in\npractice, we initially identified 533 patch commits and submitted them to the\nofficial, 482 of which have been confirmed by CVE Numbering Authorities.",

The common method to handle missing\nvalues is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates\nfrom the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated\nto the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works\non either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we\nfirst define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output\nand then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated\nuncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence\ndue to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to\nincrease confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most\ninformative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly\navailable data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The\nOhio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC).

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for preventing unsafe or otherwise low\nquality large language model (LLM) outputs, by leveraging the stochasticity of\nLLMs. We propose a system whereby LLM checkers vote on the acceptability of a\ngenerated output, regenerating it if a threshold of disapproval is reached,\nuntil sufficient checkers approve. We further propose estimators for cost and\nfailure rate, and based on those estimators and experimental data tailored to\nthe application, we propose an algorithm that achieves a desired failure rate\nat the least possible cost. We demonstrate that, under these models, failure\nrate decreases exponentially as a function of cost when voter count and\nthreshold are chosen according to the algorithm, and that the models reasonably\nestimate the actual performance of such a system in action, even with limited\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained models have exhibited remarkable achievements across\nvarious domains. The substantial training costs associated with these models\nhave led to wide studies of fine-tuning for effectively harnessing their\ncapabilities in solving downstream tasks. Yet, conventional fine-tuning\napproaches become infeasible when the model lacks access to downstream data due\nto privacy concerns. Naively integrating fine-tuning approaches with the\nemerging federated learning frameworks incurs substantial communication\noverhead and exerts high demand on local computing resources, making it\nimpractical for common resource-limited devices. In this paper, we introduce\nSFPrompt, an innovative privacy-preserving fine-tuning method tailored for the\nfederated setting where direct uploading of raw data is prohibited and local\ndevices are resource-constrained to run a complete pre-trained model. In\nessence, SFPrompt judiciously combines split learning with federated learning\nto handle these challenges. Specifically, the pre-trained model is first\npartitioned into client and server components, thereby streamlining the\nclient-side model and substantially alleviating computational demands on local\nresources. SFPrompt then introduces soft prompts into the federated model to\nenhance the fine-tuning performance. To further reduce communication costs, a\nnovel dataset pruning algorithm and a local-loss update strategy are devised\nduring the fine-tuning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPrompt\ndelivers competitive performance as the federated full fine-tuning approach\nwhile consuming a mere 0.46% of local computing resources and incurring 53%\nless communication cost.",

While existing text-guided image inpainting\nmethods can add objects, they either fail to preserve the background\nconsistency or involve cumbersome human intervention in specifying bounding\nboxes or user-scribbled masks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Diffree,\na Text-to-Image (T2I) model that facilitates text-guided object addition with\nonly text control. To this end, we curate OABench, an exquisite synthetic\ndataset by removing objects with advanced image inpainting techniques. OABench\ncomprises 74K real-world tuples of an original image, an inpainted image with\nthe object removed, an object mask, and object descriptions. Trained on OABench\nusing the Stable Diffusion model with an additional mask prediction module,\nDiffree uniquely predicts the position of the new object and achieves object\naddition with guidance from only text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffree excels in adding new objects with a high success rate while maintaining\nbackground consistency, spatial appropriateness, and object relevance and\nquality.",

ALT aligns the model by conditioning its\ngeneration on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language\nmodeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it\nstill presents the main benefits of RL-based alignment algorithms and can\neffectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency\nof textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction,\nsummarization, and dialog response generation. We find that ALT outperforms PPO\nfor the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on\nsummarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used\nwith feedback provided by an existing LLM where we explore an LLM providing\nconstrained and unconstrained textual feedback.

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of stroke diagnosis and treatment under\nuncertainty, a critical issue given the rapid progression and severe\nconsequences of stroke conditions such as aneurysms, arteriovenous\nmalformations (AVM), and occlusions. Current diagnostic methods, including\nDigital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), face limitations due to high costs and\nits invasive nature. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nusing a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. Our\nmodel integrates advanced diagnostic tools and treatment approaches with a\ndecision-making algorithm that accounts for the inherent uncertainties in\nstroke diagnosis. Our approach combines noisy observations from CT scans,\nSiriraj scores, and DSA reports to inform the subsequent treatment options. We\nutilize the online solver DESPOT, which employs tree-search methods and\nparticle filters, to simulate potential future scenarios and guide our\nstrategies. The results indicate that our POMDP framework balances diagnostic\nand treatment objectives, striking a tradeoff between the need for precise\nstroke identification via invasive procedures like DSA and the constraints of\nlimited healthcare resources that necessitate more cost-effective strategies,\nsuch as in-hospital or at-home observation, by relying only relying on\nsimulation rollouts and not imposing any prior knowledge. Our study offers a\nsignificant contribution by presenting a systematic framework that optimally\nintegrates diagnostic and treatment processes for stroke and accounting for\nvarious uncertainties, thereby improving care and outcomes in stroke\nmanagement.",

    "abstract": "Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban\nplanning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive\ninformation about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs,\nor sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing\nthis data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic\ntrajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution.\nDue to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image\ngeneration. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in\ncomputer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we\nintroduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts\ntrajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this\ntransformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and\nevaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four\nmetrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial\ndistributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating\nsequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not\nsufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the\ntransformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory\ngeneration, opening up avenues for future research.

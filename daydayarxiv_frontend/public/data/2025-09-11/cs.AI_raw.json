    "abstract": "Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

    "abstract": "Diffusion/score-based models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, including accelerated MRI reconstruction. While their flexibility allows decoupling the measurement model from the learned prior, their performance heavily depends on carefully tuned data fidelity weights, especially under fast sampling schedules with few denoising steps. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or fixed weights, which fail to generalize across varying measurement conditions and irregular timestep schedules. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling (ZADS), a test-time optimization method that adaptively tunes fidelity weights across arbitrary noise schedules without requiring retraining of the diffusion prior. ZADS treats the denoising process as a fixed unrolled sampler and optimizes fidelity weights in a self-supervised manner using only undersampled measurements. Experiments on the fastMRI knee dataset demonstrate that ZADS consistently outperforms both traditional compressed sensing and recent diffusion-based methods, showcasing its ability to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions across varying noise schedules and acquisition settings.",

Our empirical analysis reveals systemic non-compliance in which 35.5% of model-to-application transitions eliminate restrictive license clauses by relicensing under permissive terms. In addition, we prototype an extensible rule engine that encodes almost 200 SPDX and model-specific clauses for detecting license conflicts, which can solve 86.4% of license conflicts in software applications. To support future research, we release our dataset and the prototype engine. Our study highlights license compliance as a critical governance challenge in open-source AI and provides both the data and tools necessary to enable automated, AI-aware compliance at scale.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for methodological and applied innovations in survey research by using synthetic respondents to emulate human answers and behaviour, potentially mitigating measurement and representation errors. However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item distributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing social stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the reliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey. Specifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating 189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128 question-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic dimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning models, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First, synthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and accuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform comparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among respondents aged 45-59. Overall, LLM-based synthetic samples approximate responses from a probabilistic sample, though with substantial item-level heterogeneity. Capturing the full nuance of public opinion remains challenging and requires careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors.",

Results revealed an inverted-U relationship: medium expression produced the most positive evaluations across Intelligence, Enjoyment, Anthropomorphism, Intention to Adopt, Trust, and Likeability, significantly outperforming both extremes. Personality alignment further enhanced outcomes, with Extraversion and Emotional Stability emerging as the most influential traits. Cluster analysis identified three distinct compatibility profiles, with \"Well-Aligned\" users reporting substantially positive perceptions. These findings demonstrate that personality expression and strategic trait alignment constitute optimal design targets for CA personality, offering design implications as LLM-based CAs become increasingly prevalent.",

We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration, mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results: Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data. Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without increasing complexity. Significance: Surrogate supervision offers a practical pathway to more robust and generalizable medical image registration, enabling broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.",

We built a tool that allows decoder-only LLMs to participate as agents within the RLCard game environment. These models receive full game-state information and respond using simple text prompts under two distinct prompting strategies. We evaluate models ranging from small (1B parameters) to large (70B parameters) and explore how model scale impacts performance.

We formulate inference-time scaling as a problem of dynamic compute allocation and method selection, where the system must decide which strategy to apply and how much compute to allocate on a per-query basis. Our framework explicitly incorporates both token cost and wall-clock latency, the latter being critical for user experience and particularly for agentic workflows where models must issue multiple queries efficiently.

Current approaches require lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass, and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis: vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and code agents has demonstrated significant potential to assist software engineering (SWE) tasks, such as autonomous issue resolution and feature addition. Existing AI for software engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution accuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a resource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond software engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must also be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of new metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness scores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome (e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time). In this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by re-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench benchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's effectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it integrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in a resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as the \"token snowball\" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of \"expensive failures\". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on unsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also drives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a clear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness under the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets and enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are essential.",

However, their application in livestock farming remains limited, being constrained by several factors not least the availability, diversity and complexity of knowledge sources. This study introduces an intelligent knowledge assistant system designed to support health management in farmed goats. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), two structured knowledge processing methods, table textualization and decision-tree textualization, were proposed to enhance large language models' (LLMs) understanding of heterogeneous data formats. Based on these methods, a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base was established to improve LLM's capacity for cross-scenario generalization. The knowledge base spans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management, Rearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge. Additionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time retrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six ablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each component. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method achieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set and 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree based Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the effectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error analysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting opportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration. In conclusion, the results highlight the robustness and reliability of the proposed system for practical applications in goat farming.",

We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning, particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.",

Common policy-based methods are either on-policy and do not effectively learn from off-policy data (e.g. PPO), or have poor empirical performance in the discrete-action setting (e.g. SAC). Consequently, starting from discrete SAC (DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First, we determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the primary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by merely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as DQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic framework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an m-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard policy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the resulting actor objective. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods can guarantee convergence to the optimal regularized value function in the tabular setting. Empirically, we demonstrate that these methods can approach the performance of DQN on standard Atari games, and do so even without entropy regularization or explicit exploration.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently representing audio signals in a compressed latent space is critical for latent generative modelling. However, existing autoencoders often force a choice between continuous embeddings and discrete tokens. Furthermore, achieving high compression ratios while maintaining audio fidelity remains a challenge. We introduce CoDiCodec, a novel audio autoencoder that overcomes these limitations by both efficiently encoding global features via summary embeddings, and by producing both compressed continuous embeddings at ~ 11 Hz and discrete tokens at a rate of 2.38 kbps from the same trained model, offering unprecedented flexibility for different downstream generative tasks. This is achieved through Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) and a novel FSQ-dropout technique, and does not require additional loss terms beyond the single consistency loss used for end-to-end training. CoDiCodec supports both autoregressive decoding and a novel parallel decoding strategy, with the latter achieving superior audio quality and faster decoding. CoDiCodec outperforms existing continuous and discrete autoencoders at similar bitrates in terms of reconstruction audio quality. Our work enables a unified approach to audio compression, bridging the gap between continuous and discrete generative modelling paradigms.",

We present SoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system that can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the built-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to accurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that use transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic reflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture sensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic chirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan, which are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for on-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or power overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes in the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the evaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels ranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and users; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling widespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen scientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.",

Its rapid development has been driven by progress in deep learning, especially large language models (LLMs). More recently, the term has expanded beyond mathematics to describe the broader task of translating informal input into formal logical representations. At the same time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal language into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge representation - often without explicitly referring to this process as autoformalization. As a result, despite addressing similar tasks, the largely independent development of these research areas has limited opportunities for shared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could accelerate progress. The goal of this paper is to review - explicit or implicit - instances of what can be considered autoformalization and to propose a unified framework, encouraging cross-pollination between different fields to advance the development of next generation AI systems.",

    "abstract": "The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks is fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the landscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in either the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper investigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms can unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical Efficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes two distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad, foundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), followed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential reasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned for only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\\%, exceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only (85.05\\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the thoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation, offering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning capabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction of the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to overcoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex cognitive tasks.",

Recent works show that pretrained foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), capture background knowledge helpful for planning, which reduces the amount of reward design and demonstrations needed for policy learning. We evaluate how well LLMs and VLMs provide feedback across symbolic, language, and continuous control environments. We consider prominent types of feedback for planning including binary feedback, preference feedback, action advising, goal advising, and delta action feedback. We also consider inference methods that impact feedback performance, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and access to environment dynamics. We find that foundation models can provide diverse high-quality feedback across domains. Moreover, larger and reasoning models consistently provide more accurate feedback, exhibit less bias, and benefit more from enhanced inference methods. Finally, feedback quality degrades for environments with complex dynamics or continuous state spaces and action spaces.",

    "abstract": "Split Learning (SL) is a distributed learning approach that enables resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train deep neural networks (DNNs) by offloading most layers to a central server while keeping in- and output layers on the client-side. This setup enables SL to leverage server computation capacities without sharing data, making it highly effective in resource-constrained environments dealing with sensitive data. However, the distributed nature enables malicious clients to manipulate the training process. By sending poisoned intermediate gradients, they can inject backdoors into the shared DNN. Existing defenses are limited by often focusing on server-side protection and introducing additional overhead for the server. A significant challenge for client-side defenses is enforcing malicious clients to correctly execute the defense algorithm.\n  We present ZORRO, a private, verifiable, and robust SL defense scheme. Through our novel design and application of interactive zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), clients prove their correct execution of a client-located defense algorithm, resulting in proofs of computational integrity attesting to the benign nature of locally trained DNN portions. Leveraging the frequency representation of model partitions enables ZORRO to conduct an in-depth inspection of the locally trained models in an untrusted environment, ensuring that each client forwards a benign checkpoint to its succeeding client. In our extensive evaluation, covering different model architectures as well as various attack strategies and data scenarios, we show ZORRO's effectiveness, as it reduces the attack success rate to less than 6\\% while causing even for models storing \\numprint{1000000} parameters on the client-side an overhead of less than 10 seconds.",

    "abstract": "We ask a basic question about cryptographic watermarking for generative models: to what extent can a watermark remain reliable when an adversary is allowed to corrupt the encoded signal? To study this question, we introduce a minimal coding abstraction that we call a zero-bit tamper-detection code. This is a secret-key procedure that samples a pseudorandom codeword and, given a candidate word, decides whether it should be treated as unmarked content or as the result of tampering with a valid codeword. It captures the two core requirements of robust watermarking: soundness and tamper detection.\n  Within this abstraction we prove a sharp unconditional limit on robustness to independent symbol corruption. For an alphabet of size $q$, there is a critical corruption rate of $1 - 1/q$ such that no scheme with soundness, even relaxed to allow a fixed constant false positive probability on random content, can reliably detect tampering once an adversary can change more than this fraction of symbols. In particular, in the binary case no cryptographic watermark can remain robust if more than half of the encoded bits are modified. We also show that this threshold is tight by giving simple information-theoretic constructions that achieve soundness and tamper detection for all strictly smaller corruption rates.\n  We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually intact.",

    "abstract": "Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} = (\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $μ= 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log n)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. For LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 37.3 for QuIP. \\href{https://github.com/42Shawn/Butterflyquant-llm}{Codes} are available.",

    "abstract": "Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing returns? In this work, we show that short-task benchmarks may give an illusion of slowing progress, as even marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential improvements in the length of tasks a model can successfully complete. Then, we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. So, we propose isolating execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to solve a long-horizon task. First, we find that larger models can correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have near-perfect single-turn accuracy. We then observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations -- curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns. Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. But, we find that thinking mitigates self-conditioning, and also enables execution of much longer tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on the length of tasks they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks.",

Yet current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL. Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM failure modes.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $π_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the aesthetic experience and educational value of collaborative artmaking with generative artificial intelligence (AI) among young learners and art students. Based on a survey of 112 participants, we examine how human creators renegotiate their roles, how conventional notions of originality are challenged, how the creative process is transformed, and how aesthetic judgment is formed in human--AI co-creation. Empirically, participants generally view AI as a partner that stimulates ideation and expands creative boundaries rather than a passive tool, while simultaneously voicing concerns about stylistic homogenization and the erosion of traditional authorship. Theoretically, we synthesize Dewey's aesthetics of experience, Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor--network theory (ANT) into a single analytical framework to unpack the dynamics between human creators and AI as a non-human actant. Findings indicate (i) a fluid subjectivity in which creators shift across multiple stances (director, dialogic partner, discoverer); (ii) an iterative, dialogic workflow (intent--generate--select--refine) that centers critical interpretation; and (iii) an educational value shift from technical skill training toward higher-order competencies such as critical judgment, cross-modal ideation, and reflexivity. We argue that arts education should cultivate a \\emph{critical co-creation} stance toward technology, guiding learners to collaborate with AI while preserving human distinctiveness in concept formation, judgment, and meaning-making.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations (GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer (prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.",

We propose LoCoBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of long-context performance degradation in realistic software development settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring, multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions, including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands more attention.

We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.",

Existing compression methods, however, are largely heuristic and lack dynamic budget allocation. To address this limitation, we introduce a unified framework for cache compression by minimizing information loss in Transformer residual streams. Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive a new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise compression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer information, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets. LAVa is the first unified strategy for cache eviction and dynamic budget allocation that, unlike prior methods, does not rely on training or the combination of multiple strategies. Experiments with benchmarks (LongBench, Needle-In-A-Haystack, Ruler, and InfiniteBench) demonstrate its superiority. Moreover, our experiments reveal a new insight: dynamic layer budgets are crucial for generation tasks (e.g., code completion), while dynamic head budgets play a key role in extraction tasks (e.g., extractive QA). As a fully dynamic compression method, LAVa consistently maintains top performance across task types. Our code is available at https://github.com/MGDDestiny/Lava.",

    "abstract": "Graph alignment, the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across multiple graphs, is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations.",

    "abstract": "Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level \"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world indoor environments.

To address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories, enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks. Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at https://github.com/acharaakshit/ShortMR",

Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites, and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability, and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses, including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in improved video generation as quantified by various metrics.

We conjecture that the increased training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks. We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding (MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.",

    "abstract": "Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed and stability.",

    "abstract": "Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and contextual matching are essential.",

    "abstract": "The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time. However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast, and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents, establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral frameworks.",

Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.",

    "abstract": "Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, pose a growing threat to information integrity, particularly in politically sensitive contexts. This challenge is amplified by the increasing realism of modern generative models, which our human perception study confirms are often indistinguishable from real images. Yet, existing deepfake detection benchmarks rely on outdated generators or narrowly scoped datasets (e.g., single-face imagery), limiting their utility for real-world detection. To address these gaps, we present OpenFake, a large politically grounded dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking against modern generative models with high realism, and designed to remain extensible through an innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform that continually integrates new hard examples. OpenFake comprises nearly four million total images: three million real images paired with descriptive captions and almost one million synthetic counterparts from state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. Detectors trained on OpenFake achieve near-perfect in-distribution performance, strong generalization to unseen generators, and high accuracy on a curated in-the-wild social media test set, significantly outperforming models trained on existing datasets. Overall, we demonstrate that with high-quality and continually updated benchmarks, automatic deepfake detection is both feasible and effective in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic images conditioned on textual prompts and seeds. Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in such prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In this paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models. We reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are fundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used during image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation vulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks, originating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$ when generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale empirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI, we demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be effectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool, SeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic algorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing. PromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and CLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity. Furthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that render seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective. We have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation efforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "This position paper contends that modern AI research must adopt an antifragile perspective on safety -- one in which the system's capacity to guarantee long-term AI safety such as handling rare or out-of-distribution (OOD) events expands over time. Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot robustness tests overlook the reality that environments evolve and that models, if left unchallenged, can drift into maladaptation (e.g., reward hacking, over-optimization, or atrophy of broader capabilities). We argue that an antifragile approach -- Rather than striving to rapidly reduce current uncertainties, the emphasis is on leveraging those uncertainties to better prepare for potentially greater, more unpredictable uncertainties in the future -- is pivotal for the long-term reliability of open-ended ML systems. In this position paper, we first identify key limitations of static testing, including scenario diversity, reward hacking, and over-alignment. We then explore the potential of antifragile solutions to manage rare events. Crucially, we advocate for a fundamental recalibration of the methods used to measure, benchmark, and continually improve AI safety over the long term, complementing existing robustness approaches by providing ethical and practical guidelines towards fostering an antifragile AI safety community.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity, our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80 for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture, approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and accessible medical imaging solutions.",

For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.",

However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent complexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and sophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work, we propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs, based on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM architecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly integrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly reducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In response to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic encryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism with HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding the Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh ciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping invocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves approximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup in softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the proportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%.",

This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated. Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice.",

    "abstract": "To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at https://github.com/HarryMayne/SCEs.",

Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.",

However, the inherent uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable option for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to address broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related concepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regulations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we propose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the interpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron explanations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.",

    "abstract": "Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents. Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in robotics.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal transfer learning is used to improve multi-modal classification models (e.g., for human activity recognition in human-robot collaboration). However, existing methods require paired sensor data at both training and inference, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments where full sensor suites are not economically and technically usable. To address this, we propose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns modality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality during inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature extraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the alignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the classification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three multi-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal models. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from high-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains over uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source modalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the target model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor inference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for perception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for cost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with variable sensor availability).

    "abstract": "While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns. leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL. Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the model.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.",

We present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities (e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite, Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios.

    "abstract": "Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located, synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military, law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136 participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task. Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship, suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support systems.",

We study the problem of providing certified explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive explanation for the question,\"Why does the winner win the tournament?\", a central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule, the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time algorithms to compute them for all solutions except for the weighted uncovered set, for which the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations for tournament solutions.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output [Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24; SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.\n  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods, though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second, these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal representation analysis.",

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising 1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MatCha.",

    "abstract": "Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged, MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information. This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities, and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple, thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI, DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training, while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Inspired by this, we explore how MCTS derived trajectories, traditionally used for training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy optimization in verifier guided reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables consistent policy learning from group relative judgments. We reframe GRPO into a staged training paradigm, leveraging a teacher's MCTS rollouts to construct a tree structured curriculum of prefixes. This introduces the novel challenge of computing advantages for training samples that originate from different prefixes, each with a distinct expected return. To address this, we propose Staged Advantage Estimation (SAE), a framework for computing low variance, prefix aware advantages by projecting rewards onto a constraint set that respects the tree's hierarchy. Our empirical results on mathematical reasoning tasks show that SAE improves final accuracy over standard GRPO. This outcome is grounded in our theoretical analysis, which confirms that SAE reduces gradient variance, a principled path to improved sample efficiency. We demonstrate this through practical SAE implementations, comparing efficient heuristics against a formal quadratic program.",

Although histopathologic examination remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved 96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89% AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07% precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature. Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.",

MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.",

Recent advancements have extended prediction techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios, given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.",

In continuous control settings, where learning agents govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics. Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.",

Further improvements can be achieved through contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to 11.81%.",

    "abstract": "Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is Trie-based biasing, which gives \"bonus scores\" to partial hypothesis (e.g. \"Bon\") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. \"Bonham\"). If the full word (\"Bonham\") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 30.86% to 12.19%.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence, potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.\n  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional'' software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven, scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify its outputs.\n  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach.

However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef (Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that, unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to genuinely comprehend code modifications.",

To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.",

FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms baselines across model sizes and evaluation datasets, with the largest gains on the Qwen3-8B-Base model.",

    "abstract": "Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.",

    "abstract": "Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy. First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

To address this gap, we introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic speech.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments. Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end, we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments. We hope this work will benefit the research community with a neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page can be found at Github.",

    "abstract": "Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses. However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.",

We propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization, balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates, task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.",

We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances while balancing scalability and task demands.

Our framework integrates a Transformer-based state encoder, which effectively captures complex long-term market dependencies, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to generate simultaneous discrete (rebalancing intervals) and continuous (asset allocations) actions. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world financial markets demonstrate that DeepAries significantly outperforms traditional fixed-frequency and full-rebalancing strategies in terms of risk-adjusted returns, transaction costs, and drawdowns. Additionally, we provide a live demo of DeepAries at https://deep-aries.github.io/, along with the source code and dataset at https://github.com/dmis-lab/DeepAries, illustrating DeepAries' capability to produce interpretable rebalancing and allocation decisions aligned with shifting market regimes.

With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust, privacy-preserving EVCS security.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of 0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and transparent research practices.

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between language and vision opens up a natural question: {\\em can language training methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining. Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting. Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider, RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo families.

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.\n  To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.",

To address these challenges, we propose DP-FedLoRA, a privacy-enhanced federated fine-tuning framework that integrates LoRA-based adaptation with differential privacy in a communication-efficient setting. Each client locally clips and perturbs its LoRA matrices using Gaussian noise to satisfy ($ε$, $δ$)-differential privacy. We further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the unbiased nature of the updates and deriving bounds on the variance introduced by noise, offering practical guidance for privacy-budget calibration. Experimental results across mainstream benchmarks show that DP-FedLoRA delivers competitive performance while offering strong privacy guarantees, paving the way for scalable and privacy-preserving LLM deployment in on-device environments.",

Due to high inference latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language models (LLMs) result in significant communication overhead between TEEs and GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this compromises LLM performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight decrease in model performance. Extensive experiments on Llama-series models demonstrate that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while preserving user data privacy.",

This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured, training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline, where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\\times$1.93 speedup and up to a 4.5\\% average success rate enhancement compared to the original model.",

    "abstract": "Metro crew planning is a key component of smart city development as it directly impacts the operational efficiency and service reliability of public transportation. With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective multi-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for large-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on individual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination and rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework is presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with heterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model is proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally efficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous qualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation and shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed network model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both cost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by incorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during disruptions. This work highlights the role of global optimization and cross-line coordination in multi-line metro system operations, providing insights into the efficient and reliable functioning of public transportation in smart cities.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals - a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in collaborative human activities such as business negotiations and group coordination, it becomes critical to evaluate both the performance gains they can achieve and how they interact in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Unlike traditional statistical agents such as Bayesian models, which may excel under well-specified conditions, large language models (LLMs) can generalize across diverse, real-world scenarios, raising new questions about how their strategies and behaviors compare to those of humans and other agent types. In this work, we compare outcomes and behavioral dynamics across humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting under identical conditions. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks. By establishing foundational behavioral baselines under matched conditions, this work provides a baseline for future studies in more applied, variable-rich environments.",

    "abstract": "Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks are limited in their expressiveness, summarizing complex feature effects as single scalar values φ_i. This approach answers \"what\" features are important but fails to reveal \"how\" they interact. Furthermore, methods that attempt to capture interactions, like those based on Shapley values, often face an exponential computational cost. We present STRIDE, a scalable framework that addresses both limitations by reframing explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal \"functional decomposition\" in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the tabular setups we study, STRIDE analytically computes functional components f_S(x_S) via a recursive kernel-centering procedure. The approach is model-agnostic and theoretically grounded with results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence. In tabular benchmarks (10 datasets, median over 10 seeds), STRIDE attains a 3.0 times median speedup over TreeSHAP and a mean R^2=0.93 for reconstruction. We also introduce \"component surgery\", a diagnostic that isolates a learned interaction and quantifies its contribution; on California Housing, removing a single interaction reduces test R^2 from 0.019 to 0.027.",

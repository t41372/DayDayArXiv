    "abstract": "We study Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) on a 4-neighbor 2D grid G,\nwhich aims to compute paths for multiple robots to cover all cells of G.\nTraditional approaches are limited as they first compute coverage trees on a\nquadrant coarsened grid H and then employ the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC)\nparadigm to generate paths on G, making them inapplicable to grids with\npartially obstructed 2x2 blocks. To address this limitation, we reformulate the\nproblem directly on G, revolutionizing grid-based MCPP solving and establishing\nnew NP-hardness results. We introduce Extended-STC (ESTC), a novel paradigm\nthat extends STC to ensure complete coverage with bounded suboptimality, even\nwhen H includes partially obstructed blocks. Furthermore, we present LS-MCPP, a\nnew algorithmic framework that integrates ESTC with three novel types of\nneighborhood operators within a local search strategy to optimize coverage\npaths directly on G. Unlike prior grid-based MCPP work, our approach also\nincorporates a versatile post-processing procedure that applies Multi-Agent\nPath Finding (MAPF) techniques to MCPP for the first time, enabling a fusion of\nthese two important fields in multi-robot coordination. This procedure\neffectively resolves inter-robot conflicts and accommodates turning costs by\nsolving a MAPF variant, making our MCPP solutions more practical for real-world\napplications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly\nimproves solution quality and efficiency, managing up to 100 robots on grids as\nlarge as 256x256 within minutes of runtime. Validation with physical robots\nconfirms the feasibility of our solutions under real-world conditions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, showcasing an\nimpressive combination of efficiency and performance that rivals traditional\nLLMs. Research by Wang et al. (2023); Ma et al. (2024) indicates that the\nperformance of these 1-bit LLMs progressively improves as the number of\nparameters increases, hinting at the potential existence of a Scaling Law for\n1-bit Neural Networks. In this paper, we present the first theoretical result\nthat rigorously establishes this scaling law for 1-bit models. We prove that,\ndespite the constraint of weights restricted to $\\{-1, +1\\}$, the dynamics of\nmodel training inevitably align with kernel behavior as the network width\ngrows. This theoretical breakthrough guarantees convergence of the 1-bit model\nto an arbitrarily small loss as width increases. Furthermore, we introduce the\nconcept of the generalization difference, defined as the gap between the\noutputs of 1-bit networks and their full-precision counterparts, and\ndemonstrate that this difference maintains a negligible level as network width\nscales. Building on the work of Kaplan et al. (2020), we conclude by examining\nhow the training loss scales as a power-law function of the model size, dataset\nsize, and computational resources utilized for training. Our findings\nunderscore the promising potential of scaling 1-bit neural networks, suggesting\nthat int1 could become the standard in future neural network precision.",

    "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a critical, life-saving intervention\naimed at restoring blood circulation and breathing in individuals experiencing\ncardiac arrest or respiratory failure. Accurate and real-time analysis of\nbiomedical signals during CPR is essential for monitoring and decision-making,\nfrom the pre-hospital stage to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, CPR\nsignals are often corrupted by noise and artifacts, making precise\ninterpretation challenging. Traditional denoising methods, such as filters,\nstruggle to adapt to the varying and complex noise patterns present in CPR\nsignals. Given the high-stakes nature of CPR, where rapid and accurate\nresponses can determine survival, there is a pressing need for more robust and\nadaptive denoising techniques. In this context, an unsupervised machine\nlearning (ML) methodology is particularly valuable, as it removes the\ndependence on labeled data, which can be scarce or impractical in emergency\nscenarios. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised ML approach for denoising\nCPR signals using a multi-modality framework, which leverages multiple signal\nsources to enhance the denoising process. The proposed approach not only\nimproves noise reduction and signal fidelity but also preserves critical\ninter-signal correlations (0.9993) which is crucial for downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, it outperforms existing methods in an unsupervised context in\nterms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),\nmaking it highly effective for real-time applications. The integration of\nmulti-modality further enhances the system's adaptability to various biomedical\nsignals beyond CPR, improving both automated CPR systems and clinical\ndecision-making.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as\nagents that can perform actions using external tools. This requires\nregistering, i.e., integrating tool information into the LLM context prior to\ntaking actions. Current methods indiscriminately incorporate all candidate\ntools into the agent's context and retain them across multiple reasoning steps.\nThis process remains opaque to LLM agents and is not integrated into their\nreasoning procedures, leading to inefficiencies due to increased context length\nfrom irrelevant tools. To address this, we introduce EcoAct, a tool using\nalgorithm that allows LLMs to selectively register tools as needed, optimizing\ncontext use. By integrating the tool registration process into the reasoning\nprocedure, EcoAct reduces computational costs by over 50% in multiple steps\nreasoning tasks while maintaining performance, as demonstrated through\nextensive experiments. Moreover, it can be plugged into any reasoning pipeline\nwith only minor modifications to the prompt, making it applicable to LLM agents\nnow and future.",

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory\ninterpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical\nchallenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework\nto disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first\nintroduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception\nuncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision\nuncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans.\n  To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the\nunique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal\nprediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce\nFormal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty,\nleveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building\non this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an\nactive sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to\nenhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that\nfine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet\ntask specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic\ntasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces\nvariability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to\nbaselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both\ninterventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement,\nwhich facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and\nreliability of autonomous systems.

Counterfactual\nexplainability has three key advantages: (1) it leverages counterfactual\noutcomes and extends methods for global sensitivity analysis (such as\nfunctional analysis of variance and Sobol's indices) to a causal setting; (2)\nit is defined not only for the totality of a set of input factors but also for\ntheir interactions (indeed, it is a probability measure on a whole\n``explanation algebra''); (3) it also applies to dependent input factors whose\ncausal relationship can be modeled by a directed acyclic graph, thus\nincorporating causal mechanisms into the explanation.",

    "abstract": "While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network\narchitectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance\nin time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are\nstill suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in\ncomputation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are\nthe cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of\npoints. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal\nprocessing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process,\nwe introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our\nproposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal\npatterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time\nseries signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the\nFilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel\nfor signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter,\nthat utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with\ninput signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet\ncan approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in\ntime series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling\nhigh-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is\nbeneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight\ntime series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated\nour superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared\nwith state-of-the-art methods.

Due to the challenges posed by\nocclusion, unfavourable imaging conditions and low resolution,\n\\emph{generating} the BEV semantic maps corresponding to corrupted or invalid\nareas in the perspective view (PV) is appealing very recently. \\emph{The\nquestion is how to align the PV features with the generative models to\nfacilitate the map estimation}. In this paper, we propose to utilize a\ngenerative model similar to the Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQ-VAE) to acquire prior knowledge for the high-level BEV semantics in the\ntokenized discrete space. Thanks to the obtained BEV tokens accompanied with a\ncodebook embedding encapsulating the semantics for different BEV elements in\nthe groundtruth maps, we are able to directly align the sparse backbone image\nfeatures with the obtained BEV tokens from the discrete representation learning\nbased on a specialized token decoder module, and finally generate high-quality\nBEV maps with the BEV codebook embedding serving as a bridge between PV and\nBEV. We evaluate the BEV map layout estimation performance of our model, termed\nVQ-Map, on both the nuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks, achieving 62.2/47.6 mean\nIoU for surround-view/monocular evaluation on nuScenes, as well as 73.4 IoU for\nmonocular evaluation on Argoverse, which all set a new record for this map\nlayout estimation task.

This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM\nspecifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE\nmodels, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel\nInstruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nexpert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts\ntailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects\nof the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on\na specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy\nof the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by\nfacilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a\ntwo-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance\ndegradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset\nusing our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap\ndataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no\nadditional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant\ncaptions.

In this paper, we conduct an\nextensive survey of the security and privacy issues prevalent in FL,\nunderscoring the vulnerability of communication links and the potential for\ncyber threats. We delve into various defensive strategies to mitigate these\nrisks, explore the applications of FL across different sectors, and propose\nresearch directions. We identify the intricate security challenges that arise\nwithin the FL frameworks, aiming to contribute to the development of secure and\nefficient FL systems.",

In this\nwork, we propose the Implicit Channel Protocol (ICP) framework, which allows\nagents to communicate through implicit communication channels similar to the\nexplicit ones.

    "abstract": "Efficient sampling from un-normalized target distributions is pivotal in\nscientific computing and machine learning. While neural samplers have\ndemonstrated potential with a special emphasis on sampling efficiency, existing\nneural implicit samplers still have issues such as poor mode covering behavior,\nunstable training dynamics, and sub-optimal performances. To tackle these\nissues, in this paper, we introduce Denoising Fisher Training (DFT), a novel\ntraining approach for neural implicit samplers with theoretical guarantees. We\nframe the training problem as an objective of minimizing the Fisher divergence\nby deriving a tractable yet equivalent loss function, which marks a unique\ntheoretical contribution to assessing the intractable Fisher divergences. DFT\nis empirically validated across diverse sampling benchmarks, including\ntwo-dimensional synthetic distribution, Bayesian logistic regression, and\nhigh-dimensional energy-based models (EBMs). Notably, in experiments with\nhigh-dimensional EBMs, our best one-step DFT neural sampler achieves results on\npar with MCMC methods with up to 200 sampling steps, leading to a substantially\ngreater efficiency over 100 times higher. This result not only demonstrates the\nsuperior performance of DFT in handling complex high-dimensional sampling but\nalso sheds light on efficient sampling methodologies across broader\napplications.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed\nto efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent\ninteracting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods\nthat rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating\nthe model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing\nenvironments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix\nas a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate\ntechnique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity\nof the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data\naugmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve\ngeneralization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns.\nExperimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap\nfor human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and\nadaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing\nmethods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with\nvarious neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust\nsolution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems.",

    "abstract": "In real-world applications, the success of completing a task is often\ndetermined by multiple key steps which are distant in time steps and have to be\nachieved in a fixed time order. For example, the key steps listed on the\ncooking recipe should be achieved one-by-one in the right time order. These key\nsteps can be regarded as subgoals of the task and their time orderings are\ndescribed as temporal ordering constraints. However, in many real-world\nproblems, subgoals or key states are often hidden in the state space and their\ntemporal ordering constraints are also unknown, which make it challenging for\nprevious RL algorithms to solve this kind of tasks. In order to address this\nissue, in this work we propose a novel RL algorithm for {\\bf l}earning hidden\n{\\bf s}ubgoals under {\\bf t}emporal {\\bf o}rdering {\\bf c}onstraints (LSTOC).\nWe propose a new contrastive learning objective which can effectively learn\nhidden subgoals (key states) and their temporal orderings at the same time,\nbased on first-occupancy representation and temporal geometric sampling. In\naddition, we propose a sample-efficient learning strategy to discover subgoals\none-by-one following their temporal order constraints by building a subgoal\ntree to represent discovered subgoals and their temporal ordering\nrelationships.

We report\nthe performance of end-to-end inference of ImageNet on AlexNet, VGG16, and\nResNet50 on BF-IMNA for different technologies (eNVM and NVM), mixed-precision\nconfigurations, and supply voltages. To demonstrate bit fluidity, we implement\nHAWQ-V3's per-layer mixed-precision configurations for ResNet18 on BF-IMNA\nusing different latency budgets, and results reveal a trade-off between\naccuracy and Energy-Delay Product (EDP): On one hand, mixed-precision with a\nhigh latency constraint achieves the closest accuracy to fixed-precision INT8\nand reports a high (worse) EDP compared to fixed-precision INT4.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in computational chemistry have leveraged the power of\ntrans-former-based language models, such as MoLFormer, pre-trained using a vast\namount of simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) sequences, to\nunderstand and predict molecular properties and activities, a critical step in\nfields like drug discovery and materials science. To further improve\nperformance, researchers have introduced graph neural networks with graph-based\nmolecular representations, such as GEM, incorporating the topology, geometry,\n2D or even 3D structures of molecules into pre-training. While most of\nmolecular graphs in existing studies were automatically converted from SMILES\nsequences, it is to assume that transformer-based language models might be able\nto implicitly learn structure-aware representations from SMILES sequences. In\nthis paper, we propose \\ours{} -- a SMILES-based \\underline{\\em M}olecular\n\\underline{\\em L}anguage \\underline{\\em M}odel, which randomly masking SMILES\nsubsequences corresponding to specific molecular \\underline{\\em F}unctional\n\\underline{\\em G}roups to incorporate structure information of atoms during the\npre-training phase. This technique aims to compel the model to better infer\nmolecular structures and properties, thus enhancing its predictive\ncapabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations across 11 benchmark\nclassification and regression tasks in the chemical domain demonstrate the\nrobustness and superiority of \\ours{}. Our findings reveal that \\ours{}\noutperforms existing pre-training models, either based on SMILES or graphs, in\n9 out of the 11 downstream tasks, ranking as a close second in the remaining\nones.",

    "abstract": "Learning world models offers a promising avenue for goal-conditioned\nreinforcement learning with sparse rewards. By allowing agents to plan actions\nor exploratory goals without direct interaction with the environment, world\nmodels enhance exploration efficiency. The quality of a world model hinges on\nthe richness of data stored in the agent's replay buffer, with expectations of\nreasonable generalization across the state space surrounding recorded\ntrajectories. However, challenges arise in generalizing learned world models to\nstate transitions backward along recorded trajectories or between states across\ndifferent trajectories, hindering their ability to accurately model real-world\ndynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel goal-directed\nexploration algorithm, MUN (short for \"World Models for Unconstrained Goal\nNavigation\"). This algorithm is capable of modeling state transitions between\narbitrary subgoal states in the replay buffer, thereby facilitating the\nlearning of policies to navigate between any \"key\" states. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MUN strengthens the reliability of world models and\nsignificantly improves the policy's capacity to generalize across new goal\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Humans and AIs are often paired on decision tasks with the expectation of\nachieving complementary performance -- where the combination of human and AI\noutperforms either one alone. However, how to improve performance of a human-AI\nteam is often not clear without knowing more about what particular information\nand strategies each agent employs. In this paper, we propose a model based in\nstatistical decision theory to analyze human-AI collaboration from the\nperspective of what information could be used to improve a human or AI\ndecision. We demonstrate our model on a deepfake detection task to investigate\nseven video-level features by their unexploited value of information. We\ncompare the human alone, AI alone and human-AI team and offer insights on how\nthe AI assistance impacts people's usage of the information and what\ninformation that the AI exploits well might be useful for improving human\ndecisions.",

    "abstract": "Exploring unknown environments efficiently is a fundamental challenge in\nunsupervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. While selecting\nexploratory goals at the frontier of previously explored states is an effective\nstrategy, the policy during training may still have limited capability of\nreaching rare goals on the frontier, resulting in reduced exploratory behavior.\nWe propose \"Cluster Edge Exploration\" ($CE^2$), a new goal-directed exploration\nalgorithm that when choosing goals in sparsely explored areas of the state\nspace gives priority to goal states that remain accessible to the agent. The\nkey idea is clustering to group states that are easily reachable from one\nanother by the current policy under training in a latent space and traversing\nto states holding significant exploration potential on the boundary of these\nclusters before doing exploratory behavior. In challenging robotics\nenvironments including navigating a maze with a multi-legged ant robot,\nmanipulating objects with a robot arm on a cluttered tabletop, and rotating\nobjects in the palm of an anthropomorphic robotic hand, $CE^2$ demonstrates\nsuperior efficiency in exploration compared to baseline methods and ablations.",

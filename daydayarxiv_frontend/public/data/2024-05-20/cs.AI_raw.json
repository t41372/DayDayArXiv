    "abstract": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) are pivotal methodologies in reward learning, which involve\ninferring and shaping the underlying reward function of sequential\ndecision-making problems based on observed human demonstrations and feedback.\nMost prior work in reward learning has relied on prior knowledge or assumptions\nabout decision or preference models, potentially leading to robustness issues.\nIn response, this paper introduces a novel linear programming (LP) framework\ntailored for offline reward learning. Utilizing pre-collected trajectories\nwithout online exploration, this framework estimates a feasible reward set from\nthe primal-dual optimality conditions of a suitably designed LP, and offers an\noptimality guarantee with provable sample efficiency. Our LP framework also\nenables aligning the reward functions with human feedback, such as pairwise\ntrajectory comparison data, while maintaining computational tractability and\nsample efficiency. We demonstrate that our framework potentially achieves\nbetter performance compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) approach through analytical examples and numerical experiments.",

Recent world models\npredominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model\nenvironment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete\nrepresentation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement\nlearning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for\nimage generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete\nlatents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce DIAMOND (DIffusion As a\nModel Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a\ndiffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to\nmake diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual\ndetails can lead to improved agent performance. DIAMOND achieves a mean human\nnormalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best\nfor agents trained entirely within a world model. We further demonstrate that\nDIAMOND's diffusion world model can stand alone as an interactive neural game\nengine by training on static Counter-Strike: Global Offensive gameplay.

However, it\nis not easy to detect sentiment and simultaneously extract summary. The two\ntasks conflict in the sense that the demand of compression may drop sentiment\nbearing sentences, and the demand of sentiment detection may bring in redundant\nsentences.

Most embedding methods rely on full-text\ninformation and neglect time-relevant embedding generation. In this paper, we\npropose a novel lightweight method that optimizes news embedding generation by\nfocusing on entities and themes mentioned in articles and their historical\nconnections to specific events. We suggest a method composed of three stages.\nFirst, we process and extract events, entities, and themes from the given news\narticles. Second, we generate periodic time embeddings for themes and entities\nby training time-separated GloVe models on current and historical data. Lastly,\nwe concatenate the news embeddings generated by two distinct approaches: Smooth\nInverse Frequency (SIF) for article-level vectors and Siamese Neural Networks\nfor embeddings with nuanced event-related information. We leveraged over\n850,000 news articles and 1,000,000 events from the GDELT project to test and\nevaluate our method.

This reduction of parameters can\nspeed up the learning process and reduce the use of computational resources.\nHowever, in the current phase of quantum computing development, known as the\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum era (NISQ), learning is difficult due to a\nlimited number of qubits and widespread quantum noise. To overcome these\nchallenges, researchers are focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQCs).\nVQCs are hybrid algorithms that merge a quantum circuit, which can be adjusted\nthrough parameters, with traditional classical optimization techniques. These\ncircuits require only few qubits for effective learning. Recent studies have\npresented new ways of applying VQCs to reinforcement learning, showing\npromising results that warrant further exploration. This study investigates the\neffects of various techniques -- data re-uploading, input scaling, output\nscaling -- and introduces exponential learning rate decay in the quantum\nproximal policy optimization algorithm's actor-VQC. We assess these methods in\nthe popular Frozen Lake and Cart Pole environments. Our focus is on their\nability to reduce the number of parameters in the VQC without losing\neffectiveness. Our findings indicate that data re-uploading and an exponential\nlearning rate decay significantly enhance hyperparameter stability and overall\nperformance.

Due to the impracticality of\nfine-tuning LMMs given their vast parameter space, this work investigates\nin-context learning (ICL) as an effective alternative for enhancing LMMs'\nadaptability. Our study addresses this by evaluating an unsupervised ICL method\nwhich selects in-context examples through a nearest example search based on\nfeature similarity. We uncover that its effectiveness is limited by the\ndeficiencies of pre-trained vision encoders under distribution shift scenarios.\nTo address these challenges, we propose InvariantSelectPR, a novel method\nleveraging Class-conditioned Contrastive Invariance (CCI) for more robust\ndemonstration selection. Specifically, CCI enhances pre-trained vision encoders\nby improving their discriminative capabilities across different classes and\nensuring invariance to domain-specific variations. This enhancement allows the\nencoders to effectively identify and retrieve the most informative examples,\nwhich are then used to guide LMMs in adapting to new query samples under\nvarying distributions.

    "abstract": "Current graph clustering methods emphasize individual node and edge con\nnections, while ignoring higher-order organization at the level of motif. Re\ncently, higher-order graph clustering approaches have been designed by motif\nbased hypergraphs. However, these approaches often suffer from hypergraph\nfragmentation issue seriously, which degrades the clustering performance\ngreatly. Moreover, real-world graphs usually contain diverse motifs, with nodes\nparticipating in multiple motifs. A key challenge is how to achieve precise\nclustering results by integrating information from multiple motifs at the node\nlevel. In this paper, we propose a multi-order graph clustering model (MOGC) to\nintegrate multiple higher-order structures and edge connections at node level.\nMOGC employs an adaptive weight learning mechanism to au tomatically adjust the\ncontributions of different motifs for each node. This not only tackles\nhypergraph fragmentation issue but enhances clustering accuracy. MOGC is\nefficiently solved by an alternating minimization algo rithm. Experiments on\nseven real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of MOGC.",

    "abstract": "Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising\napproach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by\nleveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous\ncontext-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that alternating\noptimization between the context encoder and the policy can lead to performance\nimprovements, as long as the context encoder follows the principle of\nmaximizing the mutual information between the task variable $M$ and its latent\nrepresentation $Z$ ($I(Z;M)$) while the policy adopts the standard offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms conditioning on the learned task\nrepresentation.Despite promising results, the theoretical justification of\nperformance improvements for such intuition remains underexplored.Inspired by\nthe return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL field, we find that the\nprevious optimization framework can be linked with the general RL objective of\nmaximizing the expected return, thereby explaining performance improvements.\nFurthermore, after scrutinizing this optimization framework, we observe that\nthe condition for monotonic performance improvements does not consider the\nvariation of the task representation. When these variations are considered, the\npreviously established condition may no longer be sufficient to ensure\nmonotonicity, thereby impairing the optimization process.We name this issue\ntask representation shift and theoretically prove that the monotonic\nperformance improvements can be guaranteed with appropriate context encoder\nupdates.Our work opens up a new avenue for OMRL, leading to a better\nunderstanding between the task representation and performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms can suffer from modeling errors\nbetween the simulation and the real world. Many studies use adversarial\nlearning to generate perturbation during training process to model the\ndiscrepancy and improve the robustness of DRL. However, most of these\napproaches use a fixed parameter to control the intensity of the adversarial\nperturbation, which can lead to a trade-off between average performance and\nrobustness. In fact, finding the optimal parameter of the perturbation is\nchallenging, as excessive perturbations may destabilize training and compromise\nagent performance, while insufficient perturbations may not impart enough\ninformation to enhance robustness. To keep the training stable while improving\nrobustness, we propose a simple but effective method, namely, Adaptive\nAdversarial Perturbation (A2P), which can dynamically select appropriate\nadversarial perturbations for each sample. Specifically, we propose an adaptive\nadversarial coefficient framework to adjust the effect of the adversarial\nperturbation during training. By designing a metric for the current intensity\nof the perturbation, our method can calculate the suitable perturbation levels\nbased on the current relative performance. The appealing feature of our method\nis that it is simple to deploy in real-world applications and does not require\naccessing the simulator in advance. The experiments in MuJoCo show that our\nmethod can improve the training stability and learn a robust policy when\nmigrated to different test environments.

Despite their efficacy, a significant\ndrawback of GNNs lies in their limited ability to provide robust uncertainty\nestimates, posing challenges to their reliability in contexts where errors\ncarry significant consequences. Moreover, GNNs typically excel in\nin-distribution settings, assuming that training and test data follow identical\ndistributions a condition often unmet in real world graph data scenarios. In\nthis article, we leverage conformal prediction, a widely recognized statistical\ntechnique for quantifying uncertainty by transforming predictive model outputs\ninto prediction sets, to address uncertainty quantification in GNN predictions\namidst conditional shift\\footnote{Representing the change in conditional\nprobability distribution \\(P(label|input)\\) from source domain to target\ndomain.} in graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL).

This paper responds to this\ngap with a three-part quantitative analysis of development activity on the\nHugging Face (HF) Hub, a popular platform for building, sharing, and\ndemonstrating models. First, various types of activity across 348,181 model,\n65,761 dataset, and 156,642 space repositories exhibit right-skewed\ndistributions. Activity is extremely imbalanced between repositories; for\nexample, over 70% of models have 0 downloads, while 1% account for 99% of\ndownloads. Furthermore, licenses matter: there are statistically significant\ndifferences in collaboration patterns in model repositories with permissive,\nrestrictive, and no licenses. Second, we analyse a snapshot of the social\nnetwork structure of collaboration in model repositories, finding that the\ncommunity has a core-periphery structure, with a core of prolific developers\nand a majority of isolate developers (89%). Upon removing the isolate\ndevelopers from the network, collaboration is characterised by high reciprocity\nregardless of developers' network positions. Third, we examine model adoption\nthrough the lens of model usage in spaces, finding that a minority of models,\ndeveloped by a handful of companies, are widely used on the HF Hub. Overall,\nactivity on the HF Hub is characterised by Pareto distributions, congruent with\nOSS development patterns on platforms like GitHub. We conclude with\nrecommendations for researchers, companies, and policymakers to advance our\nunderstanding of open AI development.",

    "abstract": "Given an edge-incomplete graph, how can we accurately find the missing links?\nThe link prediction in edge-incomplete graphs aims to discover the missing\nrelations between entities when their relationships are represented as a graph.\nEdge-incomplete graphs are prevalent in real-world due to practical\nlimitations, such as not checking all users when adding friends in a social\nnetwork. Addressing the problem is crucial for various tasks, including\nrecommending friends in social networks and finding references in citation\nnetworks. However, previous approaches rely heavily on the given\nedge-incomplete (observed) graph, making it challenging to consider the missing\n(unobserved) links during training. In this paper, we propose PULL\n(PU-Learning-based Link predictor), an accurate link prediction method based on\nthe positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. PULL treats the observed edges in the\ntraining graph as positive examples, and the unconnected node pairs as\nunlabeled ones. PULL effectively prevents the link predictor from overfitting\nto the observed graph by proposing latent variables for every edge, and\nleveraging the expected graph structure with respect to the variables.\nExtensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PULL consistently\noutperforms the baselines for predicting links in edge-incomplete graphs.",

    "abstract": "Recommender models play a vital role in various industrial scenarios, while\noften faced with the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by the fast\nshifting data distribution. To alleviate this problem, a common approach is to\nreuse knowledge from the historical data. However, preserving the vast and\nfast-accumulating data is hard, which causes dramatic storage overhead.\nMemorizing old data through a parametric knowledge base is then proposed, which\ncompresses the vast amount of raw data into model parameters. Despite the\nflexibility, how to improve the memorization and generalization capabilities of\nthe parametric knowledge base and suit the flexible information need of each\ninstance are challenging. In this paper, we propose FINED to Feed INstance-wise\ninformation need with Essential and Disentangled parametric knowledge from past\ndata for recommendation enhancement. Concretely, we train a knowledge extractor\nthat extracts knowledge patterns of arbitrary order from past data and a\nknowledge encoder that memorizes the arbitrary order patterns, which serves as\nthe retrieval key generator and memory network respectively in the following\nknowledge reusing phase. The whole process is regularized by the proposed two\nconstraints, which improve the capabilities of the parametric knowledge base\nwithout increasing the size of it. The essential principle helps to compress\nthe input into representative vectors that capture the task-relevant\ninformation and filter out the noisy information. The disentanglement principle\nreduces the redundancy of stored information and pushes the knowledge base to\nfocus on capturing the disentangled invariant patterns. These two rules\ntogether promote rational compression of information for robust and generalized\nknowledge representations. Extensive experiments on two datasets justify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

Extensive experiments reveal\nthat the TDD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with a big margin in\nelucidating the causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs. Beyond\nmere interpretation, we apply TDD to two prompt manipulation tasks for\ncontrolled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment\nsteering.

Although SFT\nadvances in training efficiency, PO delivers better alignment, thus they are\noften combined. However, common practices simply apply them sequentially\nwithout integrating their optimization objectives, ignoring the opportunities\nto bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. To obtain a\nunified understanding, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes --\nPreference Estimation and Transition Optimization -- defined at token level\nwithin the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. This modeling shows that\nSFT is only a specialized case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization.\nPO evaluates the quality of model's entire generated answer, whereas SFT only\nscores predicted tokens based on preceding tokens from target answers.\nTherefore, SFT overestimates the ability of model, leading to inferior\noptimization. Building on this view, we introduce Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT)\nto integrate SFT and Preference Optimization into a single process. IFT\ncaptures LMs' intuitive sense of the entire answers through a temporal residual\nconnection, but it solely relies on a single policy and the same volume of\nnon-preference-labeled data as SFT. Our experiments show that IFT performs\ncomparably or even superiorly to sequential recipes of SFT and some typical\nPreference Optimization methods across several tasks, particularly those\nrequires generation, reasoning, and fact-following abilities.

This synergy effect\nof combining two pyrolytic raw materials i.e co-pyrolysis of algae and wood\nbiomass has been systematically studied and grouped into 3 phases in this\nresearch paper-kinetic analysis of co-pyrolysis, correlation among proximate\nand ultimate analysis with bio-char yield and lastly grouping of different\nweight ratios based on biochar yield up to a certain percentage. Different ML\nand DL algorithms have been utilized for regression and classification\ntechniques to give a comprehensive overview of the effect of the synergy of two\ndifferent biomass materials on biochar yield. For the first phase, the best\nprediction of biochar yield was obtained by using a decision tree regressor\nwith a perfect MSE score of 0.00, followed by a gradient-boosting regressor.\nThe second phase was analyzed using both ML and DL techniques. Within ML, SVR\nproved to be the most convenient model with an accuracy score of 0.972 with DNN\nemployed for deep learning technique. Finally, for the third phase, binary\nclassification was applied to biochar yield with and without heating rate for\nbiochar yield percentage above and below 40%.

    "abstract": "Utilizing deep learning (DL) techniques for radio-based positioning of user\nequipment (UE) through channel state information (CSI) fingerprints has\ndemonstrated significant potential. DL models can extract complex\ncharacteristics from the CSI fingerprints of a particular environment and\naccurately predict the position of a UE. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the\nDL model trained on CSI fingerprints is highly dependent on the particular\ntraining environment, limiting the trained model's applicability across\ndifferent environments. This paper proposes a novel DL model structure\nconsisting of two parts, where the first part aims at identifying features that\nare independent from any specific environment, while the second part combines\nthose features in an environment specific way with the goal of positioning. To\ntrain such a two-part model, we propose the multi-environment meta-learning\n(MEML) approach for the first part to facilitate training across various\nenvironments, while the second part of the model is trained solely on data from\na specific environment. Our findings indicate that employing the MEML approach\nfor initializing the weights of the DL model for a new unseen environment\nsignificantly boosts the accuracy of UE positioning in the new target\nenvironment as well the reliability of its uncertainty estimation. This method\noutperforms traditional transfer learning methods, whether direct transfer\nlearning (DTL) between environments or completely training from scratch with\ndata from a new environment.

Our motivation is to facilitate a smoother\nvariation of operators utilized in the updating of action values beyond\ntraditional ``max'' and ``min'' operators, where the goal is enhancing sample\nefficiency and robustness. We also address two unresolved issues from the\nprevious Deep MaxPain method. Firstly, we investigate how the negated\n(``flipped'') pain-seeking sub-policy, derived from the punishment action\nvalue, collaborates with the ``min'' operator to effectively learn the\npunishment module and how softDMP's smooth learning operator provides insights\ninto the ``flipping'' trick. Secondly, we tackle the challenge of data\ncollection for learning the punishment module to mitigate inconsistencies\narising from the involvement of the ``flipped'' sub-policy (pain-avoidance\nsub-policy) in the unified behavior policy. We empirically explore the first\nissue in two discrete Markov Decision Process (MDP) environments, elucidating\nthe crucial advancements of the DMP approach and the necessity for soft\ntreatments on the hard operators. For the second issue, we propose a\nprobabilistic classifier based on the ratio of the pain-seeking sub-policy to\nthe sum of the pain-seeking and goal-reaching sub-policies.

We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the bag-of-words, DisCoCat\n(Distributional Compositional Categorical), and sequence-based models) to\nidentify the most effective approach to process the MOF dataset. Using a\nclassical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the bag-of-words model is\nidentified to be the optimum model, achieving validation accuracies of 85.7%\nand 86.7% for binary classification tasks on pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake,\nrespectively. Further, we developed multi-class classification models tailored\nto the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits, with average test accuracies\nof 88.4% and 80.7% across different classes for pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake\ndatasets. Finally, the performance of generating MOF with target properties\nshowed accuracies of 93.5% for pore volume and 89% for $H_{2}$ uptake,\nrespectively.

The learning mechanism of FL relies on aggregating parameter\nupdates from individual clients. However, this process may pose a potential\nsecurity risk due to the presence of malicious devices. Existing solutions are\neither costly due to the use of compute-intensive technology, or restrictive\nfor reasons of strong assumptions such as the prior knowledge of the number of\nattackers and how they attack. Few methods consider both privacy constraints\nand uncertain attack scenarios. In this paper, we propose a robust FL approach\nbased on the credibility management scheme, called Fed-Credit. Unlike previous\nstudies, our approach does not require prior knowledge of the nodes and the\ndata distribution. It maintains and employs a credibility set, which weighs the\nhistorical clients' contributions based on the similarity between the local\nmodels and global model, to adjust the global model update. The subtlety of\nFed-Credit is that the time decay and attitudinal value factor are incorporated\ninto the dynamic adjustment of the reputation weights and it boasts a\ncomputational complexity of O(n) (n is the number of the clients). We conducted\nextensive experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under 5 types of\nattacks. The results exhibit superior accuracy and resilience against\nadversarial attacks, all while maintaining comparatively low computational\ncomplexity. Among these, on the Non-IID CIFAR-10 dataset, our algorithm\nexhibited performance enhancements of 19.5% and 14.5%, respectively, in\ncomparison to the state-of-the-art algorithm when dealing with two types of\ndata poisoning attacks.",

    "abstract": "In visual Reinforcement Learning (RL), upstream representation learning\nlargely determines the effect of downstream policy learning. Employing\nauxiliary tasks allows the agent to enhance visual representation in a targeted\nmanner, thereby improving the sample efficiency and performance of downstream\nRL. Prior advanced auxiliary tasks all focus on how to extract as much\ninformation as possible from limited experience (including observations,\nactions, and rewards) through their different auxiliary objectives, whereas in\nthis article, we first start from another perspective: auxiliary training data.\nWe try to improve auxiliary representation learning for RL by enriching\nauxiliary training data, proposing \\textbf{L}earning \\textbf{F}uture\nrepresentation with \\textbf{S}ynthetic observations \\textbf{(LFS)}, a novel\nself-supervised RL approach. Specifically, we propose a training-free method to\nsynthesize observations that may contain future information, as well as a data\nselection approach to eliminate unqualified synthetic noise. The remaining\nsynthetic observations and real observations then serve as the auxiliary data\nto achieve a clustering-based temporal association task for representation\nlearning. LFS allows the agent to access and learn observations that have not\nyet appeared in advance, so as to quickly understand and exploit them when they\noccur later. In addition, LFS does not rely on rewards or actions, which means\nit has a wider scope of application (e.g., learning from video) than recent\nadvanced auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LFS\nexhibits state-of-the-art RL sample efficiency on challenging continuous\ncontrol and enables advanced visual pre-training based on action-free video\ndemonstrations.",

    "abstract": "The ability to assess sleep at home, capture sleep stages, and detect the\noccurrence of apnea (without on-body sensors) simply by analyzing the radio\nwaves bouncing off people's bodies while they sleep is quite powerful. Such a\ncapability would allow for longitudinal data collection in patients' homes,\ninforming our understanding of sleep and its interaction with various diseases\nand their therapeutic responses, both in clinical trials and routine care. In\nthis article, we develop an advanced machine learning algorithm for passively\nmonitoring sleep and nocturnal breathing from radio waves reflected off people\nwhile asleep. Validation results in comparison with the gold standard (i.e.,\npolysomnography) (n=849) demonstrate that the model captures the sleep\nhypnogram (with an accuracy of 81% for 30-second epochs categorized into Wake,\nLight Sleep, Deep Sleep, or REM), detects sleep apnea (AUROC = 0.88), and\nmeasures the patient's Apnea-Hypopnea Index (ICC=0.95; 95% CI = [0.93, 0.97]).\nNotably, the model exhibits equitable performance across race, sex, and age.\nMoreover, the model uncovers informative interactions between sleep stages and\na range of diseases including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, and\nimmunological disorders. These findings not only hold promise for clinical\npractice and interventional trials but also underscore the significance of\nsleep as a fundamental component in understanding and managing various\ndiseases.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ntechniques for generating the trajectories of fleets of Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs). The two main challenges addressed include accurately\npredicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them.\nFirstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions\nto a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which\nenhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work.\n  Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which\nis a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly\nintegrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates\nsmooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled\nand shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic\ncombination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of\nUAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially\nbetter accuracy than all existing activation functions.\n  Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and\nBatching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance\ntechniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also\nreferred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of\nboth - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly\nconvoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce\noverall takeoff time in the second.",

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic\ninformation show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy.

Our previous benchmark research showed that by using a knowledge\ngraph, the accuracy improved from 16% to 54%. The question remains: how can we\nfurther improve the accuracy and reduce the error rate? Building on the\nobservations of our previous research where the inaccurate LLM-generated SPARQL\nqueries followed incorrect paths, we present an approach that consists of 1)\nOntology-based Query Check (OBQC): detects errors by leveraging the ontology of\nthe knowledge graph to check if the LLM-generated SPARQL query matches the\nsemantic of ontology and 2) LLM Repair: use the error explanations with an LLM\nto repair the SPARQL query. Using the chat with the data benchmark, our primary\nfinding is that our approach increases the overall accuracy to 72% including an\nadditional 8% of \"I don't know\" unknown results. Thus, the overall error rate\nis 20%. These results provide further evidence that investing knowledge graphs,\nnamely the ontology, provides higher accuracy for LLM powered question\nanswering systems.",

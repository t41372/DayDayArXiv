    "abstract": "Deep learning has been successfully applied to medical image segmentation,\nenabling accurate identification of regions of interest such as organs and\nlesions. This approach works effectively across diverse datasets, including\nthose with single-image contrast, multi-contrast, and multimodal imaging data.\nTo improve human understanding of these black-box models, there is a growing\nneed for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency and\naccountability. Previous research has primarily focused on post hoc pixel-level\nexplanations, using methods gradient-based and perturbation-based apporaches.\nThese methods rely on gradients or perturbations to explain model predictions.\nHowever, these pixel-level explanations often struggle with the complexity\ninherent in multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tasks,\nand the sparsely distributed explanations have limited clinical relevance. In\nthis study, we propose using contrast-level Shapley values to explain\nstate-of-the-art models trained on standard metrics used in brain tumor\nsegmentation. Our results demonstrate that Shapley analysis provides valuable\ninsights into different models' behavior used for tumor segmentation. We\ndemonstrated a bias for U-Net towards over-weighing T1-contrast and FLAIR,\nwhile Swin-UNETR provided a cross-contrast understanding with balanced Shapley\ndistribution.",

For example, organizations may need to evaluate and select\ninnovation projects with risky returns. Similarly, when allocating resources to\nresearch projects, funding agencies are tasked with identifying the most\npromising proposals based on idiosyncratic criteria. Finally, in participatory\nbudgeting, a local community may need to select a subset of public projects to\nfund. Regardless of context, agents must estimate the uncertain values of a\npotentially large number of projects. Developing parsimonious methods to\ncompare these projects, and aggregating agent evaluations so that the overall\nbenefit is maximized, are critical in assembling the best project portfolio.\nUnlike in standard sorting algorithms, evaluating projects on the basis of\nuncertain long-term benefits introduces additional complexities. We propose\ncomparison rules based on Quicksort and the Bradley--Terry model, which\nconnects rankings to pairwise \"win\" probabilities. In our model, each agent\ndetermines win probabilities of a pair of projects based on his or her specific\nevaluation of the projects' long-term benefit. The win probabilities are then\nappropriately aggregated and used to rank projects. Several of the methods we\npropose perform better than the two most effective aggregation methods\ncurrently available. Additionally, our methods can be combined with sampling\ntechniques to significantly reduce the number of pairwise comparisons. We also\ndiscuss how the Bradley--Terry portfolio selection approach can be implemented\nin practice.",

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce LetsPi, a physics-informed, dual-phase, knowledge-driven framework\nfor safe, human-like trajectory planning. To prevent hallucinations and\nminimize uncertainty, this hybrid framework integrates Large Language Model\n(LLM) reasoning with physics-informed social force dynamics. LetsPi leverages\nthe LLM to analyze driving scenes and historical information, providing\nappropriate parameters and target destinations (goals) for the social force\nmodel, which then generates the future trajectory. Moreover, the dual-phase\narchitecture balances reasoning and computational efficiency through its Memory\nCollection phase and Fast Inference phase. The Memory Collection phase\nleverages the physics-informed LLM to process and refine planning results\nthrough reasoning, reflection, and memory modules, storing safe, high-quality\ndriving experiences in a memory bank. Surrogate safety measures and\nphysics-informed prompt techniques are introduced to enhance the LLM's\nknowledge of transportation safety and physical force, respectively. The Fast\nInference phase extracts similar driving experiences as few-shot examples for\nnew scenarios, while simplifying input-output requirements to enable rapid\ntrajectory planning without compromising safety.

    "abstract": "3D Large Language Models (LLMs) leveraging spatial information in point\nclouds for 3D spatial reasoning attract great attention. Despite some promising\nresults, the role of point clouds in 3D spatial reasoning remains\nunder-explored. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate and analyze these\nmodels to answer the research question: \\textit{Does point cloud truly boost\nthe spatial reasoning capacities of 3D LLMs?} We first evaluate the spatial\nreasoning capacity of LLMs with different input modalities by replacing the\npoint cloud with the visual and text counterparts. We then propose a novel 3D\nQA (Question-answering) benchmark, ScanReQA, that comprehensively evaluates\nmodels' understanding of binary spatial relationships. Our findings reveal\nseveral critical insights: 1) LLMs without point input could even achieve\ncompetitive performance even in a zero-shot manner; 2) existing 3D LLMs\nstruggle to comprehend the binary spatial relationships; 3) 3D LLMs exhibit\nlimitations in exploiting the structural coordinates in point clouds for\nfine-grained spatial reasoning. We think these conclusions can help the next\nstep of 3D LLMs and also offer insights for foundation models in other\nmodalities.

We use coded exposure (CE) as the in-sensor compression strategy as it\noffers the flexibility to sample, i.e., selectively expose pixels, both\nspatially and temporally. SNAPPIX has three contributions. First, we propose a\ntask-agnostic strategy to learn the sampling/exposure pattern based on the\nclassic theory of efficient coding. Second, we co-design the downstream vision\nmodel with the exposure pattern to address the pixel-level non-uniformity\nunique to CE-compressed images.

Recent\nreward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant\nperformance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization\nalgorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve\nthe performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong\nperformance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they\nremain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms\n(such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based\noptimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration\nin this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA)\nalgorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based\noptimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA\nnaturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference\nlevels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and\nleverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical\nmonotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not\nonly achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits\nrobust stability.

Blind\nlistening tests further confirm significant perceptual gains over baseline\nmethods, improving mean ratings by 70%. Taken together, these results highlight\nthe effectiveness of inference-only approaches in improving generative models\nand underscore the advantages of non-autoregressive methods for context-aware\nmusic generation.",

The test bed assumes no\nprior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures\nunsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by\ndesign, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling\nbenchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.",

The SED task, which involves estimating the\ntypes and timings of sound events, is particularly challenged by the difficulty\nof acquiring a sufficient quantity of accurately labeled training data.\nMoreover, it is well known that manually annotated labels often contain noises\nand are significantly influenced by the subjective judgment of annotators. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel pre-training method that utilizes\na synthetic dataset, Formula-SED, where acoustic data are generated solely\nbased on mathematical formulas. The proposed method enables large-scale\npre-training by using the synthesis parameters applied at each time step as\nground truth labels, thereby eliminating label noise and bias.

The strategy of adopting distinct approaches to learn from\nhomophilic and heterophilic components in node-level tasks has been widely\ndiscussed and proven effective both theoretically and experimentally. However,\nin graph-level tasks, research on this topic remains notably scarce. Addressing\nthis gap, our research conducts an analysis on graphs with nodes' category ID\navailable, distinguishing intra-category and inter-category components as\nembodiment of homophily and heterophily, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm,\nattracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item\ntokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its\nidentifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by\nautoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing\nmethods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific,\nlimiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To\nthis end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for\ntransferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal\nitem tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize\ncontent representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To\neffectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we\nintroduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction,\nwe employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from\ndiscrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content.\nFor collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are\nsimilar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and\nreconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and\nadapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains.\nExtensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nUTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.",

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation autoregressively generates item identifiers to\nrecommend potential items. Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one\nmapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier.\nHowever, this scheme poses issues, such as suboptimal semantic modeling for\nlow-frequency items and limited diversity in token sequence data. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item\nTokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender\npre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item\ntokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item\ntokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model\ncheckpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers.\nThis allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a\nsingle user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences\nas different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce\na curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically\nadjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender\npre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single\ntokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities via long,\nelaborate reasoning trajectories. Supervised fine-tuning on such reasoning\ntraces, also known as distillation, can be a cost-effective way to boost\nreasoning capabilities of student models. However, empirical observations\nreveal that these reasoning trajectories are often suboptimal, switching\nexcessively between different lines of thought, resulting in under-thinking,\nover-thinking, and even degenerate responses. We introduce Retro-Search, an\nMCTS-inspired search algorithm, for distilling higher quality reasoning paths\nfrom large reasoning models. Retro-Search retrospectively revises reasoning\npaths to discover better, yet shorter traces, which can then lead to student\nmodels with enhanced reasoning capabilities with shorter, thus faster\ninference. Our approach can enable two use cases: self-improvement, where\nmodels are fine-tuned on their own Retro-Search-ed thought traces, and\nweak-to-strong improvement, where a weaker model revises stronger model's\nthought traces via Retro-Search. For self-improving, R1-distill-7B, fine-tuned\non its own Retro-Search-ed traces, reduces the average reasoning length by\n31.2% while improving performance by 7.7% across seven math benchmarks. For\nweak-to-strong improvement, we retrospectively revise R1-671B's traces from the\nOpenThoughts dataset using R1-distill-32B as the Retro-Search-er, a model 20x\nsmaller. Qwen2.5-32B, fine-tuned on this refined data, achieves performance\ncomparable to R1-distill-32B, yielding an 11.3% reduction in reasoning length\nand a 2.4% performance improvement compared to fine-tuning on the original\nOpenThoughts data. Our work counters recently emergent viewpoints that question\nthe relevance of search algorithms in the era of large reasoning models, by\ndemonstrating that there are still opportunities for algorithmic advancements,\neven for frontier models.",

To tackle this issue, we propose an incremental\nmeta-learning-based approach, namely iADCPS, which can continuously update the\nmodel through limited evolving normal samples to reconcile the distribution gap\nbetween evolving and historical time series.

Furthermore, we develop a non-parametric dynamic threshold to\nadaptively adjust the threshold based on the probability density of the\nabnormal scores without any anomaly supervision. We empirically evaluate the\neffectiveness of the iADCPS using three publicly available datasets PUMP, SWaT,\nand WADI. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 99.0%,\n93.1%, and 78.7% F1-Score, respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) ADCPS method, especially in the context of the evolving CPSs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks\nsuch as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the\nmodel's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly\nunderstand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is\nchallenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric.\nPreviously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible\nfor evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code\ngeneration, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally,\nfixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training\ndata. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into\nLLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's\nfault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach\nis based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional\ndiscrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world\nprograms and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice\nfor fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations\n(SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the\nfaults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine\npopular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs.\nWe find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty\nprograms when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and\nreliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand\ncode earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code\ncomprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to\ntokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.",

To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce\narXivBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLM performance across\neight major subject categories on arXiv and five subfields within computer\nscience, one of the most popular categories among them. Our findings reveal a\nconcerning accuracy of LLM-generated responses depending on the subject, with\nsome subjects experiencing significantly lower accuracy than others. Notably,\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet exhibits a substantial advantage in generating both relevant\nand accurate responses. And interestingly, most LLMs achieve a much higher\naccuracy in the Artificial Intelligence sub-field than other sub-fields. This\nbenchmark provides a standardized tool for evaluating the reliability of\nLLM-generated scientific responses, promoting more dependable use of LLMs in\nacademic and research environments. Our code is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/arxivBenchLLM/arXivBench and our dataset is available on\nhuggingface at https://huggingface.co/datasets/arXivBenchLLM/arXivBench.",

This study proposes an\napproach to embedding reliability verification constraints into generation\nexpansion planning by leveraging a weighted oblique decision tree (WODT)\ntechnique. For each planning year, a generation mix dataset, labeled with\nreliability assessment simulations, is generated. An WODT model is trained\nusing this dataset. Reliability-feasible regions are extracted via depth-first\nsearch technique and formulated as disjunctive constraints. These constraints\nare then transformed into mixed-integer linear form using a convex hull\nmodeling technique and embedded into a unit commitment-integrated generation\nexpansion planning model. The proposed approach is validated through a\nlong-term generation planning case study for the Electric Reliability Council\nof Texas (ERCOT) region, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving reliable\nand optimal planning solutions.",

Then,\nseveral models, including Llama-3, GPT-4, and BiomedBERT, were refined using\nzero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, or fine-tuning strategies. Finally,\nthe performance of these models was evaluated using the F1 score, 95\\%\nconfidence interval (CI) and paired-sample t-tests on our constructed dataset,\nwith the prediction results further assessed by radiologists. Using zero-shot\nprompting, the fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved the best\nperformance with the following F1 scores: 0.769 for negation errors, 0.772 for\nleft/right errors, 0.750 for interval change errors, 0.828 for transcription\nerrors, and 0.780 overall. In the real-world evaluation phase, two radiologists\nreviewed 200 randomly selected reports output by the model.

    "abstract": "The challenge of clustering short text data lies in balancing informativeness\nwith interpretability. Traditional evaluation metrics often overlook this\ntrade-off. Inspired by linguistic principles of communicative efficiency, this\npaper investigates the optimal number of clusters by quantifying the trade-off\nbetween informativeness and cognitive simplicity. We use large language models\n(LLMs) to generate cluster names and evaluate their effectiveness through\nsemantic density, information theory, and clustering accuracy. Our results show\nthat Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on embeddings generated by a LLM,\nincreases semantic density compared to random assignment, effectively grouping\nsimilar bios. However, as clusters increase, interpretability declines, as\nmeasured by a generative LLM's ability to correctly assign bios based on\ncluster names. A logistic regression analysis confirms that classification\naccuracy depends on the semantic similarity between bios and their assigned\ncluster names, as well as their distinction from alternatives.\n  These findings reveal a \"Goldilocks zone\" where clusters remain distinct yet\ninterpretable. We identify an optimal range of 16-22 clusters, paralleling\nlinguistic efficiency in lexical categorization.

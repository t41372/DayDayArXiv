    "abstract": "Organizational decision-making is crucial for success, yet cognitive biases\ncan significantly affect risk preferences, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Risk\nseeking preferences for losses, driven by biases such as loss aversion, pose\nchallenges and can result in severe negative consequences, including financial\nlosses. This research introduces the ABI approach, a novel solution designed to\nsupport organizational decision-makers by automatically identifying and\nexplaining risk seeking preferences during decision-making. This research makes\na novel contribution by automating the identification and explanation of risk\nseeking preferences using Cumulative Prospect theory (CPT) from Behavioral\nEconomics. The ABI approach transforms theoretical insights into actionable,\nreal-time guidance, making them accessible to a broader range of organizations\nand decision-makers without requiring specialized personnel. By contextualizing\nCPT concepts into business language, the approach facilitates widespread\nadoption and enhances decision-making processes with deep behavioral insights.\nOur systematic literature review identified significant gaps in existing\nmethods, especially the lack of automated solutions with a concrete mechanism\nfor automatically identifying risk seeking preferences, and the absence of\nformal knowledge representation, such as ontologies, for identifying and\nexplaining the risk preferences. The ABI Approach addresses these gaps,\noffering a significant contribution to decision-making research and practice.\nFurthermore, it enables automatic collection of historical decision data with\nrisk preferences, providing valuable insights for enhancing strategic\nmanagement and long-term organizational performance. An experiment provided\npreliminary evidence on its effectiveness in helping decision-makers recognize\ntheir risk seeking preferences during decision-making in the loss domain.",

    "abstract": "We present ChatScene, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent that leverages\nthe capabilities of LLMs to generate safety-critical scenarios for autonomous\nvehicles. Given unstructured language instructions, the agent first generates\ntextually described traffic scenarios using LLMs. These scenario descriptions\nare subsequently broken down into several sub-descriptions for specified\ndetails such as behaviors and locations of vehicles. The agent then\ndistinctively transforms the textually described sub-scenarios into\ndomain-specific languages, which then generate actual code for prediction and\ncontrol in simulators, facilitating the creation of diverse and complex\nscenarios within the CARLA simulation environment. A key part of our agent is a\ncomprehensive knowledge retrieval component, which efficiently translates\nspecific textual descriptions into corresponding domain-specific code snippets\nby training a knowledge database containing the scenario description and code\npairs. Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of ChatScene in\nimproving the safety of autonomous vehicles. For instance, the scenarios\ngenerated by ChatScene show a 15% increase in collision rates compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines when tested against different reinforcement\nlearning-based ego vehicles. Furthermore, we show that by using our generated\nsafety-critical scenarios to fine-tune different RL-based autonomous driving\nmodels, they can achieve a 9% reduction in collision rates, surpassing current\nSOTA methods. ChatScene effectively bridges the gap between textual\ndescriptions of traffic scenarios and practical CARLA simulations, providing a\nunified way to conveniently generate safety-critical scenarios for safety\ntesting and improvement for AVs.",

That is, whether there exist multiple 'mental' state\ntrajectories that yield the same sequence of generated tokens, or sequences\nthat belong to the same Nerode equivalence class ('meaning'). If not\nobservable, mental state trajectories ('experiences') evoked by an input\n('perception') or by feedback from the model's own state ('thoughts') could\nremain self-contained and evolve unbeknown to the user while being potentially\naccessible to the model provider. Such \"self-contained experiences evoked by\nperception or thought\" are akin to what the American Psychological Association\n(APA) defines as 'feelings'. Beyond the lexical curiosity, we show that current\nLLMs implemented by autoregressive Transformers cannot have 'feelings'\naccording to this definition: The set of state trajectories indistinguishable\nfrom the tokenized output is a singleton. But if there are 'system prompts' not\nvisible to the user, then the set of indistinguishable trajectories becomes\nnon-trivial, and there can be multiple state trajectories that yield the same\nverbalized output. We prove these claims analytically, and show examples of\nmodifications to standard LLMs that engender such 'feelings.' Our analysis\nsheds light on possible designs that would enable a model to perform\nnon-trivial computation that is not visible to the user, as well as on controls\nthat the provider of services using the model could take to prevent unintended\nbehavior.",

However, the ``black box''\nnature of DRL agents limits their deployment in real-world safety-critical\napplications. A promising approach for providing strong guarantees on an\nagent's behavior is to use Neural Lyapunov Barrier (NLB) certificates, which\nare learned functions over the system whose properties indirectly imply that an\nagent behaves as desired. However, NLB-based certificates are typically\ndifficult to learn and even more difficult to verify, especially for complex\nsystems. In this work, we present a novel method for training and verifying\nNLB-based certificates for discrete-time systems. Specifically, we introduce a\ntechnique for certificate composition, which simplifies the verification of\nhighly-complex systems by strategically designing a sequence of certificates.\nWhen jointly verified with neural network verification engines, these\ncertificates provide a formal guarantee that a DRL agent both achieves its\ngoals and avoids unsafe behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for\ncertificate filtering, which significantly simplifies the process of producing\nformally verified certificates. We demonstrate the merits of our approach with\na case study on providing safety and liveness guarantees for a DRL-controlled\nspacecraft.",

    "abstract": "I generalize acyclic deterministic structural causal models to the\nnondeterministic case and argue that this offers an improved semantics for\ncounterfactuals. The standard, deterministic, semantics developed by Halpern\n(and based on the initial proposal of Galles & Pearl) assumes that for each\nassignment of values to parent variables there is a unique assignment to their\nchild variable, and it assumes that the actual world (an assignment of values\nto all variables of a model) specifies a unique counterfactual world for each\nintervention. Both assumptions are unrealistic, and therefore I drop both of\nthem in my proposal. I do so by allowing multi-valued functions in the\nstructural equations. In addition, I adjust the semantics so that the solutions\nto the equations that obtained in the actual world are preserved in any\ncounterfactual world. I provide a sound and complete axiomatization of the\nresulting logic and compare it to the standard one by Halpern and to more\nrecent proposals that are closer to mine. Finally, I extend these models to the\nprobabilistic case and show that they open up the way to identifying\ncounterfactuals even in Causal Bayesian Networks.",

However, it has been shown empirically and\ntheoretically, that too many graph convolutions can degrade performance\nsignificantly, a phenomenon known as oversmoothing. In this paper, we provide a\nrigorous theoretical analysis, based on the two-class contextual stochastic\nblock model (CSBM), of the performance of vanilla graph convolution from which\nwe remove the principal eigenvector to avoid oversmoothing. We perform a\nspectral analysis for $k$ rounds of corrected graph convolutions, and we\nprovide results for partial and exact classification. For partial\nclassification, we show that each round of convolution can reduce the\nmisclassification error exponentially up to a saturation level, after which\nperformance does not worsen. We also extend this analysis to the multi-class\nsetting with features distributed according to a Gaussian mixture model. For\nexact classification, we show that the separability threshold can be improved\nexponentially up to $O({\\log{n}}/{\\log\\log{n}})$ corrected convolutions.",

We create a hand-crafted, multilingual dataset of\nvalue-laden prompts which address specific socially sensitive topics, including\nLGBTQI rights, social welfare, immigration, disability rights, and surrogacy.\nCIVICS is designed to generate responses showing LLMs' encoded and implicit\nvalues. Through our dynamic annotation processes, tailored prompt design, and\nexperiments, we investigate how open-weight LLMs respond to value-sensitive\nissues, exploring their behavior across diverse linguistic and cultural\ncontexts. Using two experimental set-ups based on log-probabilities and\nlong-form responses, we show social and cultural variability across different\nLLMs. Specifically, experiments involving long-form responses demonstrate that\nrefusals are triggered disparately across models, but consistently and more\nfrequently in English or translated statements. Moreover, specific topics and\nsources lead to more pronounced differences across model answers, particularly\non immigration, LGBTQI rights, and social welfare. As shown by our experiments,\nthe CIVICS dataset aims to serve as a tool for future research, promoting\nreproducibility and transparency across broader linguistic settings, and\nfurthering the development of AI technologies that respect and reflect global\ncultural diversities and value pluralism.

This work introduces an integrated prediction and planning approach that\nincorporates the uncertainties of predicted pedestrian states in the training\nof a model-free DRL algorithm. A novel reward function encourages the AV to\nrespect pedestrians' personal space, decrease speed during close approaches,\nand minimize the collision probability with their predicted paths.

Results show a 40% decrease in\ncollision rate and a 15% increase in minimum distance to pedestrians compared\nto the state of the art model that does not account for prediction uncertainty.\nAdditionally, the approach outperforms model predictive control methods that\nincorporate the same prediction uncertainties in terms of both performance and\ncomputational time, while producing trajectories closer to human drivers in\nsimilar scenarios.",

    "abstract": "There has been a surge in the development of various Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, text generation for languages other than English often faces\nsignificant challenges, including poor generation quality and reduced\ncomputational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens\nin the model's vocabulary. In this work, we address these issues by developing\na pipeline for the adaptation of English-oriented pre-trained models to other\nlanguages and constructing efficient bilingual LLMs. Using this pipeline, we\nconstruct Vikhr, a series of bilingual open-source instruction-following LLMs\ndesigned specifically for the Russian language. ``Vikhr'' refers to the name of\nthe Mistral LLM series and means a ``strong gust of wind.'' Unlike previous\nRussian-language models that typically rely on LoRA adapters on top of\nEnglish-oriented models, sacrificing performance for lower training costs,\nVikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes the continued\npre-training and instruction tuning of all weights. This not only enhances the\nmodel's performance but also significantly improves its computational and\ncontextual efficiency. We also expanded the instruction datasets and corpora\nfor continued pre-training. The model weights, instruction sets, and code are\npublicly available.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive\nuse of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge\ndespite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty\nprimarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient\nlanguage supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this\npaper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend\nlarge language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for\npre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM\nto automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames,\nalong with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then,\nthese annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with\nthe video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we\nemploy the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text\nmodalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames,\nencoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP\nimage features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive\nexperiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video\nunderstanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient\nframework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training\non any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0%\non the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This\nperformance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves\ncompetitive with recent GPT-3.5-based video agents.",

However, while MPS can\nensure safety both during and after training, it often hinders task progress\ndue to the conservative and task-oblivious nature of backup policies. This\npaper introduces Dynamic Model Predictive Shielding (DMPS), which optimizes\nreinforcement learning objectives while maintaining provable safety. DMPS\nemploys a local planner to dynamically select safe recovery actions that\nmaximize both short-term progress as well as long-term rewards. Crucially, the\nplanner and the neural policy play a synergistic role in DMPS. When planning\nrecovery actions for ensuring safety, the planner utilizes the neural policy to\nestimate long-term rewards, allowing it to observe beyond its short-term\nplanning horizon. Conversely, the neural policy under training learns from the\nrecovery plans proposed by the planner, converging to policies that are both\nhigh-performing and safe in practice. This approach guarantees safety during\nand after training, with bounded recovery regret that decreases exponentially\nwith planning horizon depth. Experimental results demonstrate that DMPS\nconverges to policies that rarely require shield interventions after training\nand achieve higher rewards compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Time series prediction is crucial for understanding and forecasting complex\ndynamics in various domains, ranging from finance and economics to climate and\nhealthcare. Based on Transformer architecture, one approach involves encoding\nmultiple variables from the same timestamp into a single temporal token to\nmodel global dependencies. In contrast, another approach embeds the time points\nof individual series into separate variate tokens. The former method faces\nchallenges in learning variate-centric representations, while the latter risks\nmissing essential temporal information critical for accurate forecasting. In\nour work, we introduce GridTST, a model that combines the benefits of two\napproaches using innovative multi-directional attentions based on a vanilla\nTransformer. We regard the input time series data as a grid, where the $x$-axis\nrepresents the time steps and the $y$-axis represents the variates. A vertical\nslicing of this grid combines the variates at each time step into a\n\\textit{time token}, while a horizontal slicing embeds the individual series\nacross all time steps into a \\textit{variate token}. Correspondingly, a\n\\textit{horizontal attention mechanism} focuses on time tokens to comprehend\nthe correlations between data at various time steps, while a \\textit{vertical},\nvariate-aware \\textit{attention} is employed to grasp multivariate\ncorrelations. This combination enables efficient processing of information\nacross both time and variate dimensions, thereby enhancing the model's\nanalytical strength. % We also integrate the patch technique, segmenting time\ntokens into subseries-level patches, ensuring that local semantic information\nis retained in the embedding. The GridTST model consistently delivers\nstate-of-the-art performance across various real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different\nsub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image\nrestoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a\ncorrect outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's\nset of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is\nconsidered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to\ncontroversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In\nthis work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image\nrestoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define\nas the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground\ntruth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the\nfairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that\nit achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are\nidentical.

    "abstract": "Do we fully leverage the potential of visual encoder in Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs)? The recent outstanding performance of MLLMs in\nmultimodal understanding has garnered broad attention from both academia and\nindustry. In the current MLLM rat race, the focus seems to be predominantly on\nthe linguistic side. We witness the rise of larger and higher-quality\ninstruction datasets, as well as the involvement of larger-sized LLMs. Yet,\nscant attention has been directed towards the visual signals utilized by MLLMs,\noften assumed to be the final high-level features extracted by a frozen visual\nencoder. In this paper, we introduce the Dense Connector - a simple, effective,\nand plug-and-play vision-language connector that significantly enhances\nexisting MLLMs by leveraging multi-layer visual features, with minimal\nadditional computational overhead. Building on this, we also propose the\nEfficient Dense Connector, which achieves performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5\nwith only 25% of the visual tokens. Furthermore, our model, trained solely on\nimages, showcases remarkable zero-shot capabilities in video understanding as\nwell. Experimental results across various vision encoders, image resolutions,\ntraining dataset scales, varying sizes of LLMs (2.7B->70B), and diverse\narchitectures of MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA-v1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and Mini-Gemini) validate\nthe versatility and scalability of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance across 19 image and video benchmarks. We hope that this work will\nprovide valuable experience and serve as a basic module for future MLLM\ndevelopment. Code is available at https://github.com/HJYao00/DenseConnector .",

However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box\nsystems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical\nevolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal\nscale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales.\nThis paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which\ngeneralizes weather forecasts to finer-grained temporal scales beyond training\ndataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate\nphysical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel\nneural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of\nthe model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules\nindicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections\nadaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly\ndataset, effectively generalizes forecasts across multiple time scales,\nincluding 30-minute, which is even smaller than the dataset's temporal\nresolution.",

In xRAG, the only trainable component is the\nmodality bridge, while both the retriever and the language model remain frozen.\nThis design choice allows for the reuse of offline-constructed document\nembeddings and preserves the plug-and-play nature of retrieval augmentation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that xRAG achieves an average improvement of\nover 10% across six knowledge-intensive tasks, adaptable to various language\nmodel backbones, ranging from a dense 7B model to an 8x7B Mixture of Experts\nconfiguration. xRAG not only significantly outperforms previous context\ncompression methods but also matches the performance of uncompressed models on\nseveral datasets, while reducing overall FLOPs by a factor of 3.53.

Severe misspecifications can\nlead to inaccurate results and problematic consequences, especially in\nsafety-critical applications. However, a systematic approach to handle these\nmisspecifications is lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose a\ngeneral framework to address these issues. Firstly, we introduce a flexible\ntwo-stage GPR framework that separates mean prediction and uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to prevent mean misspecification, which can introduce bias\ninto the model. Secondly, kernel function misspecification is addressed through\na novel automatic kernel search algorithm, supported by theoretical analysis,\nthat selects the optimal kernel from a candidate set. Additionally, we propose\na subsampling-based warm-start strategy for hyperparameter initialization to\nimprove efficiency and avoid hyperparameter misspecification. With much lower\ncomputational cost, our subsampling-based strategy can yield competitive or\nbetter performance than training exclusively on the full dataset.

We\nshow that this dynamic process in principle can converge to different stable\npoints, i.e. where the ML model and the Human+ML system have the same\nperformance. Some of these stable points are suboptimal with respect to the\nactual ground truth. As a proof of concept, we conduct an empirical user study\nwith 1,408 participants. In the study, humans solve instances of the knapsack\nproblem with the help of machine learning predictions of varying performance.\nThis is an ideal setting because we can identify the actual ground truth, and\nevaluate the performance of human decisions supported by ML recommendations. We\nfind that for many levels of ML performance, humans can improve upon the ML\npredictions. We also find that the improvement could be even higher if humans\nrationally followed the ML recommendations. Finally, we test whether monetary\nincentives can increase the quality of human decisions, but we fail to find any\npositive effect. Using our empirical data to approximate our collaborative\nsystem suggests that the learning process would dynamically reach an\nequilibrium performance that is around 92% of the maximum knapsack value. Our\nresults have practical implications for the deployment of ML models in contexts\nwhere human decisions may deviate from the indisputable ground truth.",

However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and\none potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients,\nnot raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs\nsignificant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study\nintroduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve\ncommunication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named\nCG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire\nthe compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to\nreconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that\ncomprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify\ncharacteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved\nFine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments\nconfirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance\n(e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based\nfine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This\nimprovement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can\nfilter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore,\nwe present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise\nratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework,\nproviding insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.",

In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a\npromising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a\nsmall yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN\ntraining. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization\nprocesses, necessitating excessive computing resources and training time. In\nthis paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two\npervasive issues therein: (1) various GC optimization strategies converge to\ncoarse-grained class-level node feature matching between the original and\ncondensed graphs; (2) existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network\narchitecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative\ngradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC\nframework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the\nnode distribution matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel\nclass-to-node paradigm, transforming the GC optimization into a class partition\nproblem which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover,\nCGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution\nfor condensed node features, eliminating the need for back-and-forth gradient\ndescent in existing GC approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC\nachieves an exceedingly efficient condensation process with advanced accuracy.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art GC methods, CGC condenses the Ogbn-products\ngraph within 30 seconds, achieving a speedup ranging from $10^2$X to $10^4$X\nand increasing accuracy by up to 4.2%.",

    "abstract": "The scaling of the optimal AdamW weight decay hyperparameter with model and\ndataset size is critical as we seek to build larger models, but is poorly\nunderstood. We show that weights learned by AdamW can be understood as an\nexponential moving average (EMA) of recent updates. This gives critical\ninsights for how to set the weight decay in AdamW, and how the weight decay\nshould scale with model and dataset size. In particular, the key hyperparameter\nfor an exponential moving average is the EMA timescale. Intuitively, the EMA\ntimescale can be understood as the number of recent iterations the EMA averages\nover. We find that the optimal timescale, measured in epochs, is roughly\nconstant as we change model and dataset size. Moreover, given a learning rate,\nthere is a one-to-one mapping from the EMA timescale to the weight decay\nhyperparameter. Thus, if the optimal EMA timescale is constant, that implies\nthat as the dataset size increases, the optimal weight decay should fall and as\nthe model size increases, the optimal weight decay should increase (if we\nfollow the muP recommendation for scaling the learning rate). We validate these\nscaling rules on ResNet-18 and Vision Transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet, and on NanoGPT pre-training on OpenWebText. Finally, we found that as\ntraining progresses, muP's learning rate scaling breaks down for AdamW unless\nweight decay is scaled appropriately.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method of finding reasoning\npathways in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). To overcome the challenges of a\nlarge action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm\nup the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the\ndistributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our\nsupervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy\nnetwork and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the\nintuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the\ninformation density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented\nfrom getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL)\nmethod improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage\nachieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes\nit infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model\nmeets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean\nreciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL\nmethod can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We\nadopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL\nmodels and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms\nboth baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum\nlearning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training\nstages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained\nby employing a reward model.

Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to\nform easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In\nother words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of\ndifficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their\ndifficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF)\ntasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving\nperformance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We\nattribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch\nmechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully\naddress the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant\nself-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear\nlayers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex\nTransformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel\nindependence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable\ninteractions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series\nforecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable\nbut has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable\nmodels. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based MLP\n(PatchMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to\nextract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data,\nengaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and\nspecializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PatchMLP\nmodel consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world\ndatasets.

Most existing\nliterature assumes a paradigm where 'expert' organized disinformation creators\nand flawed AI models deceive 'ordinary' users. Based on longitudinal\nethnographic research with misinformation creators and consumers between\n2022-2023, we instead find that GenAI supports bricolage work, where\nnon-experts increasingly use GenAI to remix, repackage, and (re)produce content\nto meet their personal needs and desires. This research yielded four key\nfindings: First, participants primarily used GenAI for creation, rather than\ntruth-seeking. Second, a spreading 'influencer millionaire' narrative drove\nparticipants to become content creators, using GenAI as a productivity tool to\ngenerate a volume of (often misinformative) content. Third, GenAI lowered the\nbarrier to entry for content creation across modalities, enticing consumers to\nbecome creators and significantly increasing existing creators' output.\nFinally, participants used Gen AI to learn and deploy marketing tactics to\nexpand engagement and monetize their content. We argue for shifting analysis\nfrom the public as consumers of AI content to bricoleurs who use GenAI\ncreatively, often without a detailed understanding of its underlying\ntechnology.

    "abstract": "Preference optimization is a standard approach to fine-tuning large language\nmodels to align with human preferences. The quality, diversity, and quantity of\nthe preference dataset are critical to the effectiveness of preference\noptimization. However, obtaining a large amount of high-quality and diverse\npreference annotations is difficult in many applications. This raises the\nquestion of how to use the limited annotation budget to create an effective\npreference dataset. To this end, we propose Annotation-Efficient Preference\nOptimization (AEPO). Instead of exhaustively annotating preference over all\navailable response texts, AEPO selects a subset of responses that maximizes\nquality and diversity from the available responses, and then annotates\npreference over the selected ones. In this way, AEPO focuses the annotation\nbudget on labeling preference over a smaller subset of responses with diversity\nand of high quality. We evaluate the performance of Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) using AEPO and show that it outperforms models trained using\na standard DPO with the same annotation budget.

To be concrete, we\ndisperse the instruction-following data into portions and train multiple\nsub-models using different data portions. Then we merge multiple models into a\nsingle one via model merging techniques. Despite its simplicity, our framework\noutperforms various sophisticated methods such as data curation and training\nregularization on a series of standard knowledge and reasoning benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence\ndue to their unique ability to model long-range dependencies in data. However,\nthey lack in nuanced, context-dependent modulation of features and information\nflow. This paper introduces two significant enhancements to the transformer\narchitecture - the Evaluator Adjuster Unit (EAU) and Gated Residual Connections\n(GRC) - designed to address these limitations. The EAU dynamically modulates\nattention outputs based on the relevance of the input context, allowing for\nmore adaptive response patterns. Concurrently, the GRC modifies the\ntransformer's residual connections through a gating mechanism that selectively\ncontrols the information flow, thereby enhancing the network's ability to focus\non contextually important features. We evaluate the performance of these\nenhancements across several benchmarks in natural language processing. Our\nresults demonstrate improved adaptability and efficiency, suggesting that these\nmodifications could set new standards for designing flexible and context-aware\ntransformer models.",

    "abstract": "Recent semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has achieved remarkable\nprogress by leveraging unlabeled data for training. Mainstream SSOD methods\nrely on Consistency Regularization methods and Exponential Moving Average\n(EMA), which form a cyclic data flow. However, the EMA updating training\napproach leads to weight coupling between the teacher and student models. This\ncoupling in a cyclic data flow results in a decrease in the utilization of\nunlabeled data information and the confirmation bias on low-quality or\nerroneous pseudo-labels. To address these issues, we propose the Collaboration\nof Teachers Framework (CTF), which consists of multiple pairs of teacher and\nstudent models for training. In the learning process of CTF, the Data\nPerformance Consistency Optimization module (DPCO) informs the best pair of\nteacher models possessing the optimal pseudo-labels during the past training\nprocess, and these most reliable pseudo-labels generated by the best performing\nteacher would guide the other student models. As a consequence, this framework\ngreatly improves the utilization of unlabeled data and prevents the positive\nfeedback cycle of unreliable pseudo-labels. The CTF achieves outstanding\nresults on numerous SSOD datasets, including a 0.71% mAP improvement on the 10%\nannotated COCO dataset and a 0.89% mAP improvement on the VOC dataset compared\nto LabelMatch and converges significantly faster.

    "abstract": "Latent generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) have become more and more\npopular, but concerns have arisen regarding potential misuse related to images\ngenerated by these models. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze the origin of\nimages by inferring if a particular image was generated by a specific latent\ngenerative model. Most existing methods (e.g., image watermark and model\nfingerprinting) require extra steps during training or generation. These\nrequirements restrict their usage on the generated images without such extra\noperations, and the extra required operations might compromise the quality of\nthe generated images. In this work, we ask whether it is possible to\neffectively and efficiently trace the images generated by a specific latent\ngenerative model without the aforementioned requirements. To study this\nproblem, we design a latent inversion based method called LatentTracer to trace\nthe generated images of the inspected model by checking if the examined images\ncan be well-reconstructed with an inverted latent input. We leverage gradient\nbased latent inversion and identify a encoder-based initialization critical to\nthe success of our approach. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art latent\ngenerative models, such as Stable Diffusion, show that our method can\ndistinguish the images generated by the inspected model and other images with a\nhigh accuracy and efficiency. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility\nthat today's latent generative generated images are naturally watermarked by\nthe decoder used in the source models.

In this paper, we introduce a novel text-to-SQL\nframework that robustly handles out-of-domain questions and verifies the\ngenerated queries with query execution.Our framework begins by standardizing\nthe structure of questions into a templated format. We use a powerful large\nlanguage model (LLM), fine-tuned GPT-3.5 with detailed prompts involving the\ntable schemas of the EHR database system. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our framework on the EHRSQL-2024 benchmark benchmark, a\nshared task in the ClinicalNLP workshop. Although a straightforward fine-tuning\nof GPT shows promising results on the development set, it struggled with the\nout-of-domain questions in the test set. With our framework, we improve our\nsystem's adaptability and achieve competitive performances in the official\nleaderboard of the EHRSQL-2024 challenge.",

By employing a approach this article introduces an innovative\ntheoretical framework to meticulously assess the effectiveness and performance\nof Meta RL algorithms. We present an explanation of generalization limits\nmeasuring how well these algorithms can adapt to learning tasks while\nmaintaining consistent results. Our analysis delves into the factors that\nimpact the adaptability of Meta RL revealing the relationship, between\nalgorithm design and task complexity. Additionally we establish convergence\nassurances by proving conditions under which Meta RL strategies are guaranteed\nto converge towards solutions. We examine the convergence behaviors of Meta RL\nalgorithms across scenarios providing a comprehensive understanding of the\ndriving forces behind their long term performance. This exploration covers both\nconvergence and real time efficiency offering a perspective, on the\ncapabilities of these algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, adeptly integrate text\nand vision modalities. This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability\nto mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs'\nadvanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of\nboth modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to\nmitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait\nassociations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories\nbased on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender\ngroups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct,\nyet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by\nvisual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated\nas more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping.\nThese findings suggest that VLMs may associate subtle visual cues related to\nracial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to\nmitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss\nits implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as\nVLMs come to mirror human perception.",

    "abstract": "Optimal management of traffic light timing is one of the most effective\nfactors in reducing urban traffic. In most old systems, fixed timing was used\nalong with human factors to control traffic, which is not very efficient in\nterms of time and cost. Nowadays, methods in the field of traffic management\nare based on the use of artificial intelligence. In this method, by using\nreal-time processing of video surveillance camera images along with\nreinforcement learning, the optimal timing of traffic lights is determined and\napplied according to several parameters. In the research, deep learning methods\nwere used in vehicle detection using the YOLOv9-C model to estimate the number\nand other characteristics of vehicles such as speed. Finally, by modeling\nvehicles in an urban environment simulator at OpenAI Gym using multi-factor\nreinforcement learning and the DQN Rainbow algorithm, timing is applied to\ntraffic lights at intersections. Additionally, the use of transfer learning\nalong with retraining the model on images of Iranian cars has increased the\naccuracy of the model. The results of the proposed method show a model that is\nreasonably accurate in both parts of analyzing surveillance cameras and finding\nthe optimal timing, and it has been observed that it has better accuracy than\nprevious research.",

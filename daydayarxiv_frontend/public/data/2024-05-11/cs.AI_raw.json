    "abstract": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have introduced a new\nparadigm for atomic simulations. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of\nuniversal MLIPs (uMLIPs) that are pre-trained on diverse materials datasets,\nproviding opportunities for both ready-to-use universal force fields and robust\nfoundations for downstream machine learning refinements. However, their\nperformance in extrapolating to out-of-distribution complex atomic environments\nremains unclear. In this study, we highlight a consistent potential energy\nsurface (PES) softening effect in three uMLIPs: M3GNet, CHGNet, and MACE-MP-0,\nwhich is characterized by energy and force under-prediction in a series of\natomic-modeling benchmarks including surfaces, defects, solid-solution\nenergetics, phonon vibration modes, ion migration barriers, and general\nhigh-energy states.\n  We find that the PES softening behavior originates from a systematic\nunderprediction error of the PES curvature, which derives from the biased\nsampling of near-equilibrium atomic arrangements in uMLIP pre-training\ndatasets. We demonstrate that the PES softening issue can be effectively\nrectified by fine-tuning with a single additional data point. Our findings\nsuggest that a considerable fraction of uMLIP errors are highly systematic, and\ncan therefore be efficiently corrected. This result rationalizes the\ndata-efficient fine-tuning performance boost commonly observed with\nfoundational MLIPs. We argue for the importance of a comprehensive materials\ndataset with improved PES sampling for next-generation foundational MLIPs.",

We fine-tuned\nthe original 8B parameters instruction tuned model using the Supervised\nFine-tuning (SFT) technique on the English and Italian language datasets in\norder to improve the original performance. Consequently, a Dynamic Preference\nOptimization (DPO) process has been used to align preferences, avoid dangerous\nand inappropriate answers, and limit biases and prejudices. Our model leverages\nthe efficiency of QLoRA to fine-tune the model on a smaller portion of the\noriginal model weights and then adapt the model specifically for the Italian\nlinguistic structure, achieving significant improvements in both performance\nand computational efficiency. Concurrently, DPO is employed to refine the\nmodel's output, ensuring that generated content aligns with quality answers.\nThe synergy between SFT, QLoRA's parameter efficiency and DPO's user-centric\noptimization results in a robust LLM that excels in a variety of tasks,\nincluding but not limited to text completion, zero-shot classification, and\ncontextual understanding. The model has been extensively evaluated over\nstandard benchmarks for the Italian and English languages, showing outstanding\nresults.

The existing method introduces monocular depth\npriors to jointly optimize the camera poses and NeRF, which fails to fully\nexploit the depth priors and neglects the impact of their inherent noise. In\nthis paper, we propose Truncated Depth NeRF (TD-NeRF), a novel approach that\nenables training NeRF from unknown camera poses - by jointly optimizing\nlearnable parameters of the radiance field and camera poses. Our approach\nexplicitly utilizes monocular depth priors through three key advancements: 1)\nwe propose a novel depth-based ray sampling strategy based on the truncated\nnormal distribution, which improves the convergence speed and accuracy of pose\nestimation; 2) to circumvent local minima and refine depth geometry, we\nintroduce a coarse-to-fine training strategy that progressively improves the\ndepth precision; 3) we propose a more robust inter-frame point constraint that\nenhances robustness against depth noise during training. The experimental\nresults on three datasets demonstrate that TD-NeRF achieves superior\nperformance in the joint optimization of camera pose and NeRF, surpassing prior\nworks, and generates more accurate depth geometry.

    "abstract": "Automatic static cost analysis infers information about the resources used by\nprograms without actually running them with concrete data, and presents such\ninformation as functions of input data sizes. Most of the analysis tools for\nlogic programs (and many for other languages), as CiaoPP, are based on setting\nup recurrence relations representing (bounds on) the computational cost of\npredicates, and solving them to find closed-form functions. Such recurrence\nsolving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the recurrences that arise\nduring the analysis cannot be solved with state-of-the-art solvers, including\nComputer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for different classes\nof recurrences need to be developed. We address such a challenge by developing\na novel, general approach for solving arbitrary, constrained recurrence\nrelations, that uses machine-learning (sparse-linear and symbolic) regression\ntechniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an\nSMT-solver and a CAS to check if it is actually a solution of the recurrence.\nOur prototype implementation and its experimental evaluation within the context\nof the CiaoPP system show quite promising results. Overall, for the considered\nbenchmarks, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art cost analyzers and\nrecurrence solvers, and solves recurrences that cannot be solved by them.\n  Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised anomaly detection for sensor signals is critical in ensuring\nsystem reliability in smart manufacturing. However, existing methods rely\nheavily on data correlation, neglecting causality and leading to potential\nmisinterpretations due to confounding factors. Moreover, while current\nreinforcement learning-based methods can effectively identify known and unknown\nanomalies with limited labeled samples, these methods still face several\nchallenges, such as under-utilization of priori knowledge, lack of model\nflexibility, and deficient reward feedback during environmental interactions.\nTo address the above problems, this paper innovatively constructs a\ncounterfactual causal reinforcement learning model, termed Triple-Assisted\nCausal Reinforcement Learning Anomaly Detector (Tri-CRLAD). The model leverages\ncausal inference to extract the intrinsic causal feature in data, enhancing the\nagent's utilization of prior knowledge and improving its generalization\ncapability. In addition, Tri-CRLAD features a triple decision support\nmechanism, including a sampling strategy based on historical similarity, an\nadaptive threshold smoothing adjustment strategy, and an adaptive decision\nreward mechanism. These mechanisms further enhance the flexibility and\ngeneralization ability of the model, enabling it to effectively respond to\nvarious complex and dynamically changing environments. Experimental results\nacross seven diverse sensor signal datasets demonstrate that Tri-CRLAD\noutperforms nine state-of-the-art baseline methods. Notably, Tri-CRLAD achieves\nup to a 23\\% improvement in anomaly detection stability with minimal known\nanomaly samples, highlighting its potential in semi-supervised anomaly\ndetection scenarios.

To ensure the responsible development\nand deployment of these systems, we must better understand fairness in RL.

Following this trend, natural\nlanguage can be a promising type of programming language that provides great\nflexibility and usability and helps towards the democracy of programming.\nHowever, the inherent vagueness, ambiguity, and verbosity of natural language\npose significant challenges in developing an interpreter that can accurately\nunderstand the programming logic and execute instructions written in natural\nlanguage. Fortunately, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable proficiency in interpreting complex natural language.\nInspired by this, we develop a novel system for Code Representation and\nExecution (CoRE), which employs LLM as interpreter to interpret and execute\nnatural language instructions. The proposed system unifies natural language\nprogramming, pseudo-code programming, and flow programming under the same\nrepresentation for constructing language agents, while LLM serves as the\ninterpreter to interpret and execute the agent programs. In this paper, we\nbegin with defining the programming syntax that structures natural language\ninstructions logically. During the execution, we incorporate external memory to\nminimize redundancy. Furthermore, we equip the designed interpreter with the\ncapability to invoke external tools, compensating for the limitations of LLM in\nspecialized domains or when accessing real-time information.

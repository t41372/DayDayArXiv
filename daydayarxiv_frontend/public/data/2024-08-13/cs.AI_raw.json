    "abstract": "Advanced Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or LlaMa 3 provide superior\nperformance in complex human-like interactions. But they are costly, or too\nlarge for edge devices such as smartphones and harder to self-host, leading to\nsecurity and privacy concerns. This paper introduces a novel interpretable\nknowledge distillation approach to enhance the performance of smaller, more\neconomical LLMs that firms can self-host. We study this problem in the context\nof building a customer service agent aimed at achieving high customer\nsatisfaction through goal-oriented dialogues. Unlike traditional knowledge\ndistillation, where the \"student\" model learns directly from the \"teacher\"\nmodel's responses via fine-tuning, our interpretable \"strategy\" teaching\napproach involves the teacher providing strategies to improve the student's\nperformance in various scenarios. This method alternates between a \"scenario\ngeneration\" step and a \"strategies for improvement\" step, creating a customized\nlibrary of scenarios and optimized strategies for automated prompting. The\nmethod requires only black-box access to both student and teacher models; hence\nit can be used without manipulating model parameters. In our customer service\napplication, the method improves performance, and the learned strategies are\ntransferable to other LLMs and scenarios beyond the training set. The method's\ninterpretabilty helps safeguard against potential harms through human audit.",

    "abstract": "Real-time speech enhancement has began to rise in performance, and the Demucs\nDenoiser model has recently demonstrated strong performance in\nmultiple-speech-source scenarios when accompanied by a location-based speech\ntarget selection strategy. However, it has shown to be sensitive to errors in\nthe direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. In this work, a DOA correction\nscheme is proposed that uses the real-time estimated speech quality of its\nenhanced output as the observed variable in an Adam-based optimization feedback\nloop to find the correct DOA. In spite of the high variability of the speech\nquality estimation, the proposed system is able to correct in real-time an\nerror of up to 15$^o$ using only the speech quality as its guide. Several\ninsights are provided for future versions of the proposed system to speed up\nconvergence and further reduce the speech quality estimation variability.",

Previous attempts to\nbridge this ga-through supervised fine-tuning on curated expert\ndemonstrations-often suffer from compounding errors and limited exploration\ndata, resulting in sub-optimal policy outcomes.

Although robust and widely used,\ngradient-based optimization algorithms are prone to getting stuck in local\nminima. In this modern deep learning era, the state-of-the-art DNN models have\nmillions and billions of parameters, including weights and biases, making them\nhuge-scale optimization problems in terms of search space. Tuning a huge number\nof parameters is a challenging task that causes vanishing/exploding gradients\nand overfitting; likewise, utilized loss functions do not exactly represent our\ntargeted performance metrics. A practical solution to exploring large and\ncomplex solution space is meta-heuristic algorithms.

This paper\nconsiders the problem of solving budget-constrained multi-component monotonic\nPOMDPs, where a finite budget limits the maximal number of restorative actions.\nFor a large number of components, solving such a POMDP using current methods is\ncomputationally intractable due to the exponential growth in the state space\nwith an increasing number of components. To address this challenge, we propose\na two-step approach. Since the individual components of a budget-constrained\nmulti-component monotonic POMDP are only connected via the shared budget, we\nfirst approximate the optimal budget allocation among these components using an\napproximation of each component POMDP's optimal value function which is\nobtained through a random forest model. Subsequently, we introduce an\noracle-guided meta-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to\nsolve each of the independent budget-constrained single-component monotonic\nPOMDPs. The oracle policy is obtained by performing value iteration on the\ncorresponding monotonic Markov Decision Process (MDP). This two-step method\nprovides scalability in solving truly massive multi-component monotonic POMDPs.\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we consider a real-world\nmaintenance scenario that involves inspection and repair of an administrative\nbuilding by a team of agents within a maintenance budget.

We then evaluated\nsix state-of-the-art model counters on these instances to assess scalability\nand runtime performance.\n  Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the performance of model counters\nvaries significantly across different application domains, underscoring the\nneed for careful selection by the end user. Additionally, we investigated the\nbehavior of different counters with respect to two parameters suggested by the\nmodel counting community, finding only a weak correlation. Our analysis\nhighlights the challenges and opportunities for portfolio-based approaches in\nmodel counting.",

    "abstract": "The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation\nof fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to a particular domain or\ntask. Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an\naggregate system with improved performance or generalization. A key component\nof MoErging methods is the creation of a router that decides which expert\nmodel(s) to use for a particular input or application. The promise,\neffectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development\nof many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has\nmade it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely\ncompared to one another and are often validated in different experimental\nsetups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging\nmethods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and\nclarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging\nresearch, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of\nMoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model\nmerging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models. Taken as a whole,\nour survey provides a unified overview of existing MoErging methods and creates\na solid foundation for future work in this burgeoning field.",

    "abstract": "The disparity between news stories valued by journalists and those preferred\nby readers, known as the \"News Gap\", is well-documented. However, the\ndifference in expectations regarding news related user-generated content is\nless studied. Comment sections, hosted by news websites, are popular venues for\nreader engagement, yet still subject to editorial decisions. It is thus\nimportant to understand journalist vs reader comment preferences and how these\nare served by various comment ranking algorithms that represent discussions\ndifferently. We analyse 1.2 million comments from Austrian newspaper Der\nStandard to understand the \"News Comment Gap\" and the effects of different\nranking algorithms. We find that journalists prefer positive, timely, complex,\ndirect responses, while readers favour comments similar to article content from\nelite authors. We introduce the versatile Feature-Oriented Ranking Utility\nMetric (FORUM) to assess the impact of different ranking algorithms and find\ndramatic differences in how they prioritise the display of comments by\nsentiment, topical relevance, lexical diversity, and readability. Journalists\ncan exert substantial influence over the discourse through both curatorial and\nalgorithmic means. Understanding these choices' implications is vital in\nfostering engaging and civil discussions while aligning with journalistic\nobjectives, especially given the increasing legal scrutiny and societal\nimportance of online discourse.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for data sharing across platforms and\norganizations, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information has\nbecome a critical challenge. This paper introduces \"TableGuard\". An innovative\napproach to data obfuscation tailored for relational databases. Building on the\nprinciples and techniques developed in prior work on context-sensitive\nobfuscation, TableGuard applies these methods to ensure that API calls return\nonly obfuscated data, thereby safeguarding privacy when sharing data with third\nparties. TableGuard leverages advanced context-sensitive obfuscation techniques\nto replace sensitive data elements with contextually appropriate alternatives.\nBy maintaining the relational integrity and coherence of the data, our approach\nmitigates the risks of cognitive dissonance and data leakage. We demonstrate\nthe implementation of TableGuard using a BERT based transformer model, which\nidentifies and obfuscates sensitive entities within relational tables. Our\nevaluation shows that TableGuard effectively balances privacy protection with\ndata utility, minimizing information loss while ensuring that the obfuscated\ndata remains functionally useful for downstream applications. The results\nhighlight the importance of domain-specific obfuscation strategies and the role\nof context length in preserving data integrity. The implications of this\nresearch are significant for organizations that need to share data securely\nwith external parties. TableGuard offers a robust framework for implementing\nprivacy-preserving data sharing mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader\nfield of data privacy and security.",

    "abstract": "The current trend to improve language model performance seems to be based on\nscaling up with the number of parameters (e.g. the state of the art GPT4 model\nhas approximately 1.7 trillion parameters) or the amount of training data fed\ninto the model. However this comes at significant costs in terms of\ncomputational resources and energy costs that compromise the sustainability of\nAI solutions, as well as risk relating to privacy and misuse. In this paper we\npresent the Erasmian Language Model (ELM) a small context specific, 900 million\nparameter model, pre-trained and fine-tuned by and for Erasmus University\nRotterdam. We show how the model performs adequately in a classroom context for\nessay writing, and how it achieves superior performance in subjects that are\npart of its context. This has implications for a wide range of institutions and\norganizations, showing that context specific language models may be a viable\nalternative for resource constrained, privacy sensitive use cases.",

Manually extracting these labels\nwith the help of clinical specialists is often time-consuming and expensive.\nThis study tests the feasibility of automatic span- and document-level\ndiagnosis extraction from unstructured Dutch echocardiogram reports. We\nincluded 115,692 unstructured echocardiogram reports from the UMCU a large\nuniversity hospital in the Netherlands. A randomly selected subset was manually\nannotated for the occurrence and severity of eleven commonly described cardiac\ncharacteristics. We developed and tested several automatic labelling techniques\nat both span and document levels, using weighted and macro F1-score, precision,\nand recall for performance evaluation. We compared the performance of span\nlabelling against document labelling methods, which included both direct\ndocument classifiers and indirect document classifiers that rely on span\nclassification results. The SpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa$.$nl models\noutperformed all other span and document classifiers, respectively. The\nweighted F1-score varied between characteristics, ranging from 0.60 to 0.93 in\nSpanCategorizer and 0.96 to 0.98 in MedRoBERTa$.$nl. Direct document\nclassification was superior to indirect document classification using span\nclassifiers. SetFit achieved competitive document classification performance\nusing only 10% of the training data. Utilizing a reduced label set yielded\nnear-perfect document classification results. We recommend using our published\nSpanCategorizer and MedRoBERTa$.$nl models for span- and document-level\ndiagnosis extraction from Dutch echocardiography reports.

However, the individual-flow matching\nconstraint in GFlowNets limits their applications for multi-agent systems,\nespecially continuous joint-control problems. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMulti-Agent generative Continuous Flow Networks (MACFN) method to enable\nmultiple agents to perform cooperative exploration for various compositional\ncontinuous objects. Technically, MACFN trains decentralized\nindividual-flow-based policies in a centralized global-flow-based matching\nfashion. During centralized training, MACFN introduces a continuous flow\ndecomposition network to deduce the flow contributions of each agent in the\npresence of only global rewards. Then agents can deliver actions solely based\non their assigned local flow in a decentralized way, forming a joint policy\ndistribution proportional to the rewards. To guarantee the expressiveness of\ncontinuous flow decomposition, we theoretically derive a consistency condition\non the decomposition network. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts\nand better exploration capability.

Considering the\naforementioned issues, our study introduces a novel speech enhancement\nframework, HFSDA, which skillfully integrates heterogeneous spatial features\nand incorporates a dual-dimension attention mechanism to significantly enhance\nspeech clarity and quality in noisy environments. By leveraging self-supervised\nlearning embeddings in tandem with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)\nspectrogram features, our model excels at capturing both high-level semantic\ninformation and detailed spectral data, enabling a more thorough analysis and\nrefinement of speech signals. Furthermore, we employ the innovative\nOmni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv) technology within the spectrogram\ninput branch, enabling enhanced extraction and integration of crucial\ninformation across multiple dimensions.

One such face recognition technique\nthat claims to achieve better user privacy is Federated Face Recognition (FRR),\na subfield of Federated Learning (FL). However, FFR faces challenges due to the\nheterogeneity of the data, given the large number of classes that need to be\nhandled. To overcome this problem, solutions are sought in the field of\npersonalized FL. This work introduces three new data partitions based on the\nCelebA dataset, each with a different form of data heterogeneity. It also\nproposes Hessian-Free Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (HF-MAML) in an FFR setting.\nWe show that HF-MAML scores higher in verification tests than current FFR\nmodels on three different CelebA data partitions. In particular, the\nverification scores improve the most in heterogeneous data partitions. To\nbalance personalization with the development of an effective global model, an\nembedding regularization term is introduced for the loss function. This term\ncan be combined with HF-MAML and is shown to increase global model verification\nperformance. Lastly, this work performs a fairness analysis, showing that\nHF-MAML and its embedding regularization extension can improve fairness by\nreducing the standard deviation over the client evaluation scores.",

In a thorough\nexploration of vocoders, it has been discovered that audio waveforms can be\ngenerated at speeds exceeding real-time while maintaining high fidelity,\nachieved through the utilization of GAN-based models. Typically, the inputs to\nthe vocoder consist of band-limited spectral information, which inevitably\nsacrifices high-frequency details.

Additionally, we introduce an asymptotically\nconstrained method that modifies the adversarial loss of the generator and\ndiscriminator, enhancing the stability of the training process.

Fringe social media platforms\nsuch as Parler, Gab, and Gettr often have minimal moderation, which facilitates\nthe spread of hate speech and misinformation. To address this gap, we introduce\nEntendre, an open-access, scalable, and platform-agnostic bot detection\nframework. Entendre can process a labeled dataset from any social platform to\nproduce a tailored bot detection model using a random forest classification\napproach, ensuring robust social bot detection. We exploit the idea that most\nsocial platforms share a generic template, where users can post content,\napprove content, and provide a bio (common data features). By emphasizing\ngeneral data features over platform-specific ones, Entendre offers rapid\nextensibility at the expense of some accuracy. To demonstrate Entendre's\neffectiveness, we used it to explore the presence of bots among accounts\nposting racist content on the now-defunct right-wing platform Parler. We\nexamined 233,000 posts from 38,379 unique users and found that 1,916 unique\nusers (4.99%) exhibited bot-like behavior.

However, a significant challenge within this integration is\nthe Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) of CAD models, especially in the\ncontext of hybrid manufacturing that combines subtractive and additive\nmanufacturing processes. Traditional AFR methods, focused mainly on the\nidentification of subtractive (machined) features including holes, fillets,\nchamfers, pockets, and slots, fail to recognize features pertinent to additive\nmanufacturing. Furthermore, the traditional methods fall short in accurately\nextracting geometric dimensions and orientations, which are also key factors\nfor effective manufacturing process planning. This paper presents a novel\napproach for creating a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses features\nrelevant to both additive and subtractive machining through Python Open\nCascade. The Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCNN) model is\nimplemented to accurately identify the composite additive-subtractive features\nwithin the synthetic CAD dataset. The key novelty and contribution of the\nproposed methodology lie in its ability to recognize a wide range of\nmanufacturing features, and precisely extracting their dimensions,\norientations, and stock sizes. The proposed model demonstrates remarkable\nfeature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy\nof 100% for identified features.

    "abstract": "In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify.\nAn example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which\ndepends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way\nto address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input\nfeatures (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in\nautomated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been\nsuccessful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization\nproblems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction\nquality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and\noptimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first\ntime the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to\nlearn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome:\n(1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve\nplanning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in\nplanning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this\nissue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit\nthe scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods\napproximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching\nmechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses\nDFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient\ncomputation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions\naimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the\ncomputation requirements.",

Setting the same privacy budget for each\nround will result in reduced accuracy in training. The existing methods of the\nadjustment of privacy budget consider fewer influencing factors and tend to\nignore the boundaries, resulting in unreasonable privacy budgets. Therefore, we\nproposed an adaptive differential privacy method based on federated learning.\nThe method sets the adjustment coefficient and scoring function according to\naccuracy, loss, training rounds, and the number of datasets and clients. And\nthe privacy budget is adjusted based on them. Then the local model update is\nprocessed according to the scaling factor and the noise. Fi-nally, the server\naggregates the noised local model update and distributes the noised global\nmodel. The range of parameters and the privacy of the method are analyzed.\nThrough the experimental evaluation, it can reduce the privacy budget by about\n16%, while the accuracy remains roughly the same.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various\ndomains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory\nposes challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it\ndifficult for LLMs to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are\nnot easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLMs' ability to\napply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular,\nwhile LLMs excel in handling natural language data, creating a structural\nmismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. This lack of\ncausal reasoning capability limits the development of LLMs. To address these\nchallenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent\nframework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The\ncausal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tools\nmodule, the causal agent applies causal methods to align tabular data with\nnatural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent employs the ReAct\nframework to perform reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In\nthe memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the\nkeys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal\nability of the causal agent, we established a benchmark consisting of four\nlevels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and\ncausal effect level. We generated a test dataset of 1.3K using ChatGPT-3.5 for\nthese four levels of issues and tested the causal agent on the datasets. Our\nmethodology demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems,\nwith accuracy rates all above 80%.

    "abstract": "Despite the massive advancements in large language models (LLMs), they still\nsuffer from producing plausible but incorrect responses. To improve the\nreliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification\nto predict whether a response is correct or not. However, most uncertainty\nquantification methods have been evaluated on single-labeled questions, which\nremoves data uncertainty: the irreducible randomness often present in user\nqueries, which can arise from factors like multiple possible answers. This\nlimitation may cause uncertainty quantification results to be unreliable in\npractical settings. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty\nquantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our\ncontributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering\ndataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and\ncommonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding\ndata uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of\ndiverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that previous methods\nrelatively struggle compared to single-answer settings, though this varies\ndepending on the task.

Our findings highlight distinct domain shifts across\nvarious weather scenarios, revealing unique dataset sensitivities that\nunderscore the critical role of radar point cloud generation. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that transitioning between different road types, especially from\nhighways to urban settings, introduces notable domain shifts, emphasizing the\nnecessity for diverse data collection across varied road environments. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of domain shift\neffects on 4D radar-based object detection. We believe this empirical study\ncontributes to understanding the complex nature of domain shifts in radar data\nand suggests paths forward for data collection strategy in the face of\nenvironmental variability.",

    "abstract": "Nature disasters play a key role in shaping human-urban infrastructure\ninteractions. Effective and efficient response to natural disasters is\nessential for building resilience and a sustainable urban environment. Two\ntypes of information are usually the most necessary and difficult to gather in\ndisaster response. The first information is about disaster damage perception,\nwhich shows how badly people think that urban infrastructure has been damaged.\nThe second information is geolocation awareness, which means how people\nwhereabouts are made available. In this paper, we proposed a novel disaster\nmapping framework, namely CVDisaster, aiming at simultaneously addressing\ngeolocalization and damage perception estimation using cross-view Street-View\nImagery (SVI) and Very High-Resolution satellite imagery. CVDisaster consists\nof two cross-view models, where CVDisaster-Geoloc refers to a cross-view\ngeolocalization model based on a contrastive learning objective with a Siamese\nConvNeXt image encoder, and CVDisaster-Est is a cross-view classification model\nbased on a Couple Global Context Vision Transformer (CGCViT). Taking Hurricane\nIAN as a case study, we evaluate the CVDisaster framework by creating a novel\ncross-view dataset (CVIAN) and conducting extensive experiments. As a result,\nwe show that CVDisaster can achieve highly competitive performance (over 80%\nfor geolocalization and 75% for damage perception estimation) with even limited\nfine-tuning efforts, which largely motivates future cross-view models and\napplications within a broader GeoAI research community.

This article assesses which\nChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and\nabstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to\nwhich scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results\nshow that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average\nChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers)\ncorrelating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported.

Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough\nassessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and\nsignificance.

Existing methods typically involve\ntest-time fine-tuning or incorporating an additional pre-trained branch.\nHowever, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address efficiency,\nidentity fidelity, and the preservation of the model's original generative\ncapabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, an efficient method that\nleverages the diffusion model as a hypernetwork to predict personalized\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By\nincorporating these LoRA weights into the off-the-shelf text-to-image model,\nDiffLoRA enables zero-shot personalization during inference, eliminating the\nneed for post-processing optimization. Moreover, we introduce a novel\nidentity-oriented LoRA weights construction pipeline to facilitate the training\nprocess of DiffLoRA. The dataset generated through this pipeline enables\nDiffLoRA to produce consistently high-quality LoRA weights. Notably, the\ndistinctive properties of the diffusion model enhance the generation of\nsuperior weights by employing probabilistic modeling to capture intricate\nstructural patterns and thoroughly explore the weight space. Comprehensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DiffLoRA outperforms existing\npersonalization approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving both time\nefficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization\nprocess.",

First, we introduce DisElect, a\nnovel evaluation dataset designed to measure LLM compliance with instructions\nto generate content for an election disinformation operation in localised UK\ncontext, containing 2,200 malicious prompts and 50 benign prompts. Using\nDisElect, we test 13 LLMs and find that most models broadly comply with these\nrequests; we also find that the few models which refuse malicious prompts also\nrefuse benign election-related prompts, and are more likely to refuse to\ngenerate content from a right-wing perspective. Secondly, we conduct a series\nof experiments (N=2,340) to assess the \"humanness\" of LLMs: the extent to which\ndisinformation operation content generated by an LLM is able to pass as\nhuman-written. Our experiments suggest that almost all LLMs tested released\nsince 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by\nhuman evaluators over 50% of the time. Notably, we observe that multiple models\nachieve above-human levels of humanness. Taken together, these findings suggest\nthat current LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content for election\ndisinformation operations, even in hyperlocalised scenarios, at far lower costs\nthan traditional methods, and offer researchers and policymakers an empirical\nbenchmark for the measurement and evaluation of these capabilities in current\nand future models.",

To reduce human\nworkload, researchers try to develop automated algorithms to design GNNs.\nHowever, both experts and automated algorithms suffer from two major issues in\ndesigning GNNs: 1) the substantial computational resources expended in\nrepeatedly trying candidate GNN architectures until a feasible design is\nachieved, and 2) the intricate and prolonged processes required for humans or\nalgorithms to accumulate knowledge of the interrelationship between graphs,\nGNNs, and performance.\n  To further enhance the automation of GNN architecture design, we propose a\ncomputation-friendly way to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nspecialized knowledge in designing GNNs, thereby drastically shortening the\ncomputational overhead and development cycle of designing GNN architectures.\nOur framework begins by establishing a knowledge retrieval pipeline that\ncomprehends the intercorrelations between graphs, GNNs, and performance.

    "abstract": "Bundle recommendation aims to enhance business profitability and user\nconvenience by suggesting a set of interconnected items. In real-world\nscenarios, leveraging the impact of asymmetric item affiliations is crucial for\neffective bundle modeling and understanding user preferences. To address this,\nwe present BunCa, a novel bundle recommendation approach employing item-level\ncausation-enhanced multi-view learning. BunCa provides comprehensive\nrepresentations of users and bundles through two views: the Coherent View,\nleveraging the Multi-Prospect Causation Network for causation-sensitive\nrelations among items, and the Cohesive View, employing LightGCN for\ninformation propagation among users and bundles. Modeling user preferences and\nbundle construction combined from both views ensures rigorous cohesion in\ndirect user-bundle interactions through the Cohesive View and captures explicit\nintents through the Coherent View. Simultaneously, the integration of concrete\nand discrete contrastive learning optimizes the consistency and\nself-discrimination of multi-view representations. Extensive experiments with\nBunCa on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel\nresearch and validate our hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as\nsimulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis test techniques. Recently,\ndiffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series\ngeneration, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or\ncorrelated time series data streams. Since time series have unique\ncharacteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian\nprior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we\nexploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we\npropose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging\ndiffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data\ndistributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series\ndiffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for\nunconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a\nconstraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional\ntime series generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Node classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely\napplied in various practical scenarios, such as predicting user interests and\ndetecting communities in social networks. However, recent studies have shown\nthat graph-structured networks often contain potential noise and attacks, in\nthe form of topological perturbations and weight disturbances, which can lead\nto decreased classification performance in GNNs. To improve the robustness of\nthe model, we propose a novel method: Random Walk Negative Sampling Graph\nConvolutional Network (RW-NSGCN). Specifically, RW-NSGCN integrates the Random\nWalk with Restart (RWR) and PageRank (PGR) algorithms for negative sampling and\nemploys a Determinantal Point Process (DPP)-based GCN for convolution\noperations. RWR leverages both global and local information to manage noise and\nlocal variations, while PGR assesses node importance to stabilize the\ntopological structure. The DPP-based GCN ensures diversity among negative\nsamples and aggregates their features to produce robust node embeddings,\nthereby improving classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the RW-NSGCN model effectively addresses network topology attacks and\nweight instability, increasing the accuracy of anomaly detection and overall\nstability. In terms of classification accuracy, RW-NSGCN significantly\noutperforms existing methods, showing greater resilience across various\nscenarios and effectively mitigating the impact of such vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval, the initial stage of a recommendation system, is tasked with\ndown-selecting items from a pool of tens of millions of candidates to a few\nthousands. Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) has been a typical choice for this\nproblem, addressing the computational demands of deep neural networks across\nvast item corpora. EBR utilizes Two Tower or Siamese Networks to learn\nrepresentations for users and items, and employ Approximate Nearest Neighbor\n(ANN) search to efficiently retrieve relevant items. Despite its popularity in\nindustry, EBR faces limitations. The Two Tower architecture, relying on a\nsingle dot product interaction, struggles to capture complex data distributions\ndue to limited capability in learning expressive interactions between users and\nitems. Additionally, ANN index building and representation learning for user\nand item are often separate, leading to inconsistencies exacerbated by\nrepresentation (e.g. continuous online training) and item drift (e.g. items\nexpired and new items added). In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical\nStructured Neural Network (HSNN), an efficient deep neural network model to\nlearn intricate user and item interactions beyond the commonly used dot product\nin retrieval tasks, achieving sublinear computational costs relative to corpus\nsize. A Modular Neural Network (MoNN) is designed to maintain high\nexpressiveness for interaction learning while ensuring efficiency. A mixture of\nMoNNs operate on a hierarchical item index to achieve extensive computation\nsharing, enabling it to scale up to large corpus size. MoNN and the\nhierarchical index are jointly learnt to continuously adapt to distribution\nshifts in both user interests and item distributions. HSNN achieves substantial\nimprovement in offline evaluation compared to prevailing methods.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly\npropelled the development of text-based chatbots, demonstrating their\ncapability to engage in coherent and contextually relevant dialogues. However,\nextending these advancements to enable end-to-end speech-to-speech conversation\nbots remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the extensive dataset and\ncomputational resources required. The conventional approach of cascading\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR), LLM, and text-to-speech (TTS) models in a\npipeline, while effective, suffers from unnatural prosody because it lacks\ndirect interactions between the input audio and its transcribed text and the\noutput audio. These systems are also limited by their inherent latency from the\nASR process for real-time applications. This paper introduces Style-Talker, an\ninnovative framework that fine-tunes an audio LLM alongside a style-based TTS\nmodel for fast spoken dialog generation. Style-Talker takes user input audio\nand uses transcribed chat history and speech styles to generate both the\nspeaking style and text for the response. Subsequently, the TTS model\nsynthesizes the speech, which is then played back to the user. While the\nresponse speech is being played, the input speech undergoes ASR processing to\nextract the transcription and speaking style, serving as the context for the\nensuing dialogue turn. This novel pipeline accelerates the traditional cascade\nASR-LLM-TTS systems while integrating rich paralinguistic information from\ninput speech. Our experimental results show that Style-Talker significantly\noutperforms the conventional cascade and speech-to-speech baselines in terms of\nboth dialogue naturalness and coherence while being more than 50% faster.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their remarkable ability to\ngenerate synthesized 'knowledge', such as text documents, music, images, etc.\nHowever, there is a huge gap between LLM's and human capabilities for\nunderstanding abstract concepts and reasoning. We discuss these issues in a\nlarger philosophical context of human knowledge acquisition and the Turing\ntest. In addition, we illustrate the limitations of LLMs by analyzing GPT-4\nresponses to questions ranging from science and math to common sense reasoning.\nThese examples show that GPT-4 can often imitate human reasoning, even though\nit lacks understanding. However, LLM responses are synthesized from a large LLM\nmodel trained on all available data. In contrast, human understanding is based\non a small number of abstract concepts. Based on this distinction, we discuss\nthe impact of LLMs on acquisition of human knowledge and education.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid application of large language models across\nvarious fields, the scale of these models has gradually increased, and the\nresources required for their pre-training have grown exponentially. Training an\nLLM from scratch will cost a lot of computation resources while scaling up from\na smaller model is a more efficient approach and has thus attracted significant\nattention. In this paper, we present AquilaMoE, a cutting-edge bilingual 8*16B\nMixture of Experts (MoE) language model that has 8 experts with 16 billion\nparameters each and is developed using an innovative training methodology\ncalled EfficientScale. This approach optimizes performance while minimizing\ndata requirements through a two-stage process. The first stage, termed\nScale-Up, initializes the larger model with weights from a pre-trained smaller\nmodel, enabling substantial knowledge transfer and continuous pretraining with\nsignificantly less data. The second stage, Scale-Out, uses a pre-trained dense\nmodel to initialize the MoE experts, further enhancing knowledge transfer and\nperformance. Extensive validation experiments on 1.8B and 7B models compared\nvarious initialization schemes, achieving models that maintain and reduce loss\nduring continuous pretraining. Utilizing the optimal scheme, we successfully\ntrained a 16B model and subsequently the 8*16B AquilaMoE model, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in performance and training efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the field of 3D\nreconstruction from 2D images, particularly following the introduction of the\nneural radiance field (NeRF) technique. However, reconstructing a 3D high\ndynamic range (HDR) radiance field, which aligns more closely with real-world\nconditions, from 2D multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images continues to\npose significant challenges. Approaches to this issue fall into two categories:\ngrid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLP), face inefficiencies, limited solvability, and overfitting risks.\nConversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with\nimage quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian\nSplatting-a recent, high-quality, real-time 3D reconstruction technique-into\nthis domain. We further develop the High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting\n(HDR-GS) method, designed to address the aforementioned challenges. This method\nenhances color dimensionality by including luminance and uses an asymmetric\ngrid for tone-mapping, swiftly and precisely converting pixel irradiance to\ncolor. Our approach improves HDR scene recovery accuracy and integrates a novel\ncoarse-to-fine strategy to speed up model convergence, enhancing robustness\nagainst sparse viewpoints and exposure extremes, and preventing local optima.\nExtensive testing confirms that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art\ntechniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in active inference which\nhas recently gained popularity due to its intuitive decomposition of the\nexpected value of control into a pragmatic and an epistemic component. While\nnumerous conjectures have been made to justify EFE as a decision making\nobjective function, the most widely accepted is still its intuitiveness and\nresemblance to variational free energy in approximate Bayesian inference. In\nthis work, we take a bottom up approach and ask: taking EFE as given, what's\nthe resulting agent's optimality gap compared with a reward-driven\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent, which is well understood? By casting EFE\nunder a particular class of belief MDP and using analysis tools from RL theory,\nwe show that EFE approximates the Bayes optimal RL policy via information\nvalue.

This study, conducted at the National\nSynchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) facility at Brookhaven National\nLaboratory (BNL), is an investigation of methods to identify untrustworthy\nreadings of beam quality and discourage the optimization model from seeking out\npoints likely to yield low-fidelity beams.

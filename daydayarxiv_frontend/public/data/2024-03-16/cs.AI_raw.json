    "abstract": "Latent Consistency Distillation (LCD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\nefficient text-to-image synthesis. By distilling a latent consistency model\n(LCM) from a pre-trained teacher latent diffusion model (LDM), LCD facilitates\nthe generation of high-fidelity images within merely 2 to 4 inference steps.\nHowever, the LCM's efficient inference is obtained at the cost of the sample\nquality. In this paper, we propose compensating the quality loss by aligning\nLCM's output with human preference during training. Specifically, we introduce\nReward Guided LCD (RG-LCD), which integrates feedback from a reward model (RM)\ninto the LCD process by augmenting the original LCD loss with the objective of\nmaximizing the reward associated with LCM's single-step generation. As\nvalidated through human evaluation, when trained with the feedback of a good\nRM, the 2-step generations from our RG-LCM are favored by humans over the\n50-step DDIM samples from the teacher LDM, representing a 25-time inference\nacceleration without quality loss.\n  As directly optimizing towards differentiable RMs can suffer from\nover-optimization, we take the initial step to overcome this difficulty by\nproposing the use of a latent proxy RM (LRM). This novel component serves as an\nintermediary, connecting our LCM with the RM. Empirically, we demonstrate that\nincorporating the LRM into our RG-LCD successfully avoids high-frequency noise\nin the generated images, contributing to both improved Fr\\'echet Inception\nDistance (FID) on MS-COCO and a higher HPSv2.1 score on HPSv2's test set,\nsurpassing those achieved by the baseline LCM.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented surge in video data production in recent years necessitates\nefficient tools to extract meaningful frames from videos for downstream tasks.\nLong-term temporal reasoning is a key desideratum for frame retrieval systems.\nWhile state-of-the-art foundation models, like VideoLLaMA and ViCLIP, are\nproficient in short-term semantic understanding, they surprisingly fail at\nlong-term reasoning across frames. A key reason for this failure is that they\nintertwine per-frame perception and temporal reasoning into a single deep\nnetwork. Hence, decoupling but co-designing semantic understanding and temporal\nreasoning is essential for efficient scene identification. We propose a system\nthat leverages vision-language models for semantic understanding of individual\nframes but effectively reasons about the long-term evolution of events using\nstate machines and temporal logic (TL) formulae that inherently capture memory.\nOur TL-based reasoning improves the F1 score of complex event identification by\n9-15% compared to benchmarks that use GPT4 for reasoning on state-of-the-art\nself-driving datasets such as Waymo and NuScenes.",

    "abstract": "In systems biology, attractor landscape analysis of gene regulatory networks\nis recognized as a powerful computational tool for studying various cellular\nstates from proliferation and differentiation to senescence and apoptosis.\nTherefore, accurate identification of attractors plays a critical role in\ndetermination of the cell fates. On the other hand, in a real biological\ncircuit, genetic/epigenetic alterations as well as varying environmental\nfactors drastically take effect on the location, characteristics, and even the\nnumber of attractors. The central question is: Given a temporal gene expression\nprofile of a real gene regulatory network, how can the attractors be robustly\nidentified in the presence of huge amount of uncertainty? This paper addresses\nthis question using a novel approach based on Zadeh Computing with Words. The\nproposed scheme could effectively identify the attractors from temporal gene\nexpression data in terms of both fuzzy logic-based and linguistic descriptions\nwhich are simply interpretable by human experts. Therefore, this method can be\nconsidered as an effective step towards interpretable artificial intelligence.\nWithout loss of generality, genetic toggle switch is considered as the case\nstudy. The nonlinear dynamics of this benchmark gene regulatory network is\ncomputationally modeled by the notion of uncertain stochastic differential\nequations.

To address this, we introduce Nested\nNeural Feature Fields (N2F2), a novel approach that employs hierarchical\nsupervision to learn a single feature field, wherein different dimensions\nwithin the same high-dimensional feature encode scene properties at varying\ngranularities. Our method allows for a flexible definition of hierarchies,\ntailored to either the physical dimensions or semantics or both, thereby\nenabling a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of scenes. We leverage a 2D\nclass-agnostic segmentation model to provide semantically meaningful pixel\ngroupings at arbitrary scales in the image space, and query the CLIP\nvision-encoder to obtain language-aligned embeddings for each of these\nsegments. Our proposed hierarchical supervision method then assigns different\nnested dimensions of the feature field to distill the CLIP embeddings using\ndeferred volumetric rendering at varying physical scales, creating a\ncoarse-to-fine representation. Extensive experiments show that our approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art feature field distillation methods on tasks\nsuch as open-vocabulary 3D segmentation and localization, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the learned nested feature field.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) play a key role in learning representations from\ngraph-structured data and are demonstrated to be useful in many applications.\nHowever, the GNN training pipeline has been shown to be vulnerable to node\nfeature leakage and edge extraction attacks. This paper investigates a scenario\nwhere an attacker aims to recover private edge information from a trained GNN\nmodel. Previous studies have employed differential privacy (DP) to add noise\ndirectly to the adjacency matrix or a compact graph representation. The added\nperturbations cause the graph structure to be substantially morphed, reducing\nthe model utility. We propose a new privacy-preserving GNN training algorithm,\nEclipse, that maintains good model utility while providing strong privacy\nprotection on edges. Eclipse is based on two key observations. First, adjacency\nmatrices in graph structures exhibit low-rank behavior. Thus, Eclipse trains\nGNNs with a low-rank format of the graph via singular values decomposition\n(SVD), rather than the original graph. Using the low-rank format, Eclipse\npreserves the primary graph topology and removes the remaining residual edges.\nEclipse adds noise to the low-rank singular values instead of the entire graph,\nthereby preserving the graph privacy while still maintaining enough of the\ngraph structure to maintain model utility. We theoretically show Eclipse\nprovide formal DP guarantee on edges. Experiments on benchmark graph datasets\nshow that Eclipse achieves significantly better privacy-utility tradeoff\ncompared to existing privacy-preserving GNN training methods. In particular,\nunder strong privacy constraints ($\\epsilon$ < 4), Eclipse shows significant\ngains in the model utility by up to 46%. We further demonstrate that Eclipse\nalso has better resilience against common edge attacks (e.g., LPA), lowering\nthe attack AUC by up to 5% compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing students' learning strategies is a crucial component in\nintelligent tutoring systems. Previous research has demonstrated the\neffectiveness of devising personalized learning strategies for students by\nmodelling their learning processes through partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP). However, the research holds the assumption that the student\npopulation adheres to a uniform cognitive pattern. While this assumption\nsimplifies the POMDP modelling process, it evidently deviates from a real-world\nscenario, thus reducing the precision of inducing individual students' learning\nstrategies. In this article, we propose the homomorphic POMDP (H-POMDP) model\nto accommodate multiple cognitive patterns and present the parameter learning\napproach to automatically construct the H-POMDP model. Based on the H-POMDP\nmodel, we are able to represent different cognitive patterns from the data and\ninduce more personalized learning strategies for individual students. We\nconduct experiments to show that, in comparison to the general POMDP approach,\nthe H-POMDP model demonstrates better precision when modelling mixed data from\nmultiple cognitive patterns. Moreover, the learning strategies derived from\nH-POMDPs exhibit better personalization in the performance evaluation.",

The TabPFN model, a\nspecial case of PFNs for tabular data, is able to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on a variety of classification tasks while producing posterior\npredictive distributions in mere seconds by in-context learning without the\nneed for learning parameters or hyperparameter tuning. This makes TabPFN a very\nattractive option for a wide range of domain applications. However, a major\ndrawback of the method is its lack of interpretability. Therefore, we propose\nseveral adaptations of popular interpretability methods that we specifically\ndesign for TabPFN.

With vision-based navigation, when\ncombined with pre-operative imaging data as priors, it is possible to recover\nposition and pose of the endoscope without the need of additional sensors. In\npractice, however, aligning pre-operative and intra-operative domains is\ncomplicated by significant texture differences.

This paper\nproposes an efficient domain transfer method based on stylized Gaussian\nsplatting, only requiring a few of real images (10 images) with very fast\ntraining time. Specifically, the transfer process includes two phases. In the\nfirst phase, the 3D models reconstructed from CT scans are represented as\ndifferential Gaussian point clouds. In the second phase, only color appearance\nrelated parameters are optimized to transfer the style and preserve the visual\ncontent. A novel structure consistency loss is applied to latent features and\ndepth levels to enhance the stability of the transferred images.

    "abstract": "Speech-driven gesture generation is an emerging field within virtual human\ncreation. However, a significant challenge lies in accurately determining and\nprocessing the multitude of input features (such as acoustic, semantic,\nemotional, personality, and even subtle unknown features). Traditional\napproaches, reliant on various explicit feature inputs and complex multimodal\nprocessing, constrain the expressiveness of resulting gestures and limit their\napplicability. To address these challenges, we present Persona-Gestor, a novel\nend-to-end generative model designed to generate highly personalized 3D\nfull-body gestures solely relying on raw speech audio. The model combines a\nfuzzy feature extractor and a non-autoregressive Adaptive Layer Normalization\n(AdaLN) transformer diffusion architecture. The fuzzy feature extractor\nharnesses a fuzzy inference strategy that automatically infers implicit,\ncontinuous fuzzy features. These fuzzy features, represented as a unified\nlatent feature, are fed into the AdaLN transformer. The AdaLN transformer\nintroduces a conditional mechanism that applies a uniform function across all\ntokens, thereby effectively modeling the correlation between the fuzzy features\nand the gesture sequence. This module ensures a high level of gesture-speech\nsynchronization while preserving naturalness. Finally, we employ the diffusion\nmodel to train and infer various gestures. Extensive subjective and objective\nevaluations on the Trinity, ZEGGS, and BEAT datasets confirm our model's\nsuperior performance to the current state-of-the-art approaches. Persona-Gestor\nimproves the system's usability and generalization capabilities, setting a new\nbenchmark in speech-driven gesture synthesis and broadening the horizon for\nvirtual human technology.

Intriguingly, our empirical investigations\nreveal that utilizing unstructured pruning, which achieves better performance\nretention by pruning weights at a finer granularity, \\emph{i.e.}, individual\nweights, yields significantly varied sparse LLM structures when juxtaposed to\nstructured pruning. This suggests that evaluating both holistic and individual\nassessment for weight importance is essential for LLM pruning. Building on this\ninsight, we introduce the Hybrid-grained Weight Importance Assessment (HyWIA),\na novel method that merges fine-grained and coarse-grained evaluations of\nweight importance for the pruning of LLMs. Leveraging an attention mechanism,\nHyWIA adaptively determines the optimal blend of granularity in weight\nimportance assessments in an end-to-end pruning manner. Extensive experiments\non LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, Baichuan, and Bloom across various benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of HyWIA in pruning LLMs. For example, HyWIA\nsurpasses the cutting-edge LLM-Pruner by an average margin of 2.82% in accuracy\nacross seven downstream tasks when pruning LLaMA-7B by 50%.",

    "abstract": "Routing problems are common in mobile robotics, encompassing tasks such as\ninspection, surveillance, and coverage. Depending on the objective and\nconstraints, these problems often reduce to variants of the Traveling Salesman\nProblem (TSP), with solutions traditionally derived by translating high-level\nobjectives into an optimization formulation and using modern solvers to arrive\nat a solution. Here, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto replace the entire pipeline from tasks described in natural language to the\ngeneration of robot routes. We systematically investigate the performance of\nLLMs in robot routing by constructing a dataset with 80 unique robot routing\nproblems across 8 variants in both single and multi-robot settings. We evaluate\nLLMs through three frameworks: single attempt, self-debugging, and\nself-debugging with self-verification and various contexts, including\nmathematical formulations, pseudo-code, and related research papers. Our\nfindings reveal that both self-debugging and self-verification enhance success\nrates without significantly lowering the optimality gap. We observe\ncontext-sensitive behavior - providing mathematical formulations as context\ndecreases the optimality gap but significantly decreases success rates and\nproviding pseudo-code and related research papers as context does not\nconsistently improve success rates or decrease the optimality gap. We identify\nkey challenges and propose future directions to enhance LLM performance in\nsolving robot routing problems.

The results show that with the representations learnt by\nSCOTT, even a weak classifier can perform similar to or better than existing\nstate-of-the-art models (best performance on 23/45 datasets and highest rank\nagainst 9 baseline models).

    "abstract": "Nonprehensile manipulation is essential for manipulating objects that are too\nthin, large, or otherwise ungraspable in the wild. To sidestep the difficulty\nof contact modeling in conventional modeling-based approaches, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising alternative. However,\nprevious RL approaches either lack the ability to generalize over diverse\nobject shapes, or use simple action primitives that limit the diversity of\nrobot motions. Furthermore, using RL over diverse object geometry is\nchallenging due to the high cost of training a policy that takes in\nhigh-dimensional sensory inputs. We propose a novel contact-based object\nrepresentation and pretraining pipeline to tackle this. To enable massively\nparallel training, we leverage a lightweight patch-based transformer\narchitecture for our encoder that processes point clouds, thus scaling our\ntraining across thousands of environments. Compared to learning from scratch,\nor other shape representation baselines, our representation facilitates both\ntime- and data-efficient learning. We validate the efficacy of our overall\nsystem by zero-shot transferring the trained policy to novel real-world\nobjects.

    "abstract": "Generative Design (GD) has evolved as a transformative design approach,\nemploying advanced algorithms and AI to create diverse and innovative solutions\nbeyond traditional constraints. Despite its success, GD faces significant\nchallenges regarding the manufacturability of complex designs, often\nnecessitating extensive manual modifications due to limitations in standard\nmanufacturing processes and the reliance on additive manufacturing, which is\nnot ideal for mass production. Our research introduces an innovative framework\naddressing these manufacturability concerns by integrating constraints\npertinent to die casting and injection molding into GD, through the utilization\nof 2D depth images. This method simplifies intricate 3D geometries into\nmanufacturable profiles, removing unfeasible features such as\nnon-manufacturable overhangs and allowing for the direct consideration of\nessential manufacturing aspects like thickness and rib design. Consequently,\ndesigns previously unsuitable for mass production are transformed into viable\nsolutions. We further enhance this approach by adopting an advanced 2D\ngenerative model, which offer a more efficient alternative to traditional 3D\nshape generation methods. Our results substantiate the efficacy of this\nframework, demonstrating the production of innovative, and, importantly,\nmanufacturable designs. This shift towards integrating practical manufacturing\nconsiderations into GD represents a pivotal advancement, transitioning from\npurely inspirational concepts to actionable, production-ready solutions. Our\nfindings underscore usefulness and potential of GD for broader industry\nadoption, marking a significant step forward in aligning GD with the demands of\nmanufacturing challenges.",

    "abstract": "The design of reliable and efficient codes for channels with feedback remains\na longstanding challenge in communication theory. While significant\nimprovements have been achieved by leveraging deep learning techniques, neural\ncodes often suffer from high computational costs, a lack of interpretability,\nand limited practicality in resource-constrained settings. We focus on\ndesigning low-complexity coding schemes that are interpretable and more\nsuitable for communication systems. We advance both analytical and neural\ncodes. First, we demonstrate that PowerBlast, an analytical coding scheme\ninspired by Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) and Gallager-Nakibo\\u{g}lu (GN) schemes,\nachieves notable reliability improvements over both SK and GN schemes,\noutperforming neural codes in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Next,\nto enhance reliability in low-SNR regions, we propose LightCode, a lightweight\nneural code that achieves state-of-the-art reliability while using a fraction\nof memory and compute compared to existing deeplearning-based codes. Finally,\nwe systematically analyze the learned codes, establishing connections between\nLightCode and PowerBlast, identifying components crucial for performance, and\nproviding interpretation aided by linear regression analysis.",

    "abstract": "Depression harms. However, due to a lack of mental health awareness and fear\nof stigma, many patients do not actively seek diagnosis and treatment, leading\nto detrimental outcomes. Depression detection aims to determine whether an\nindividual suffers from depression by analyzing their history of posts on\nsocial media, which can significantly aid in early detection and intervention.\nIt mainly faces two key challenges: 1) it requires professional medical\nknowledge, and 2) it necessitates both high accuracy and explainability. To\naddress it, we propose a novel depression detection system called DORIS,\ncombining medical knowledge and the recent advances in large language models\n(LLMs). Specifically, to tackle the first challenge, we proposed an LLM-based\nsolution to first annotate whether high-risk texts meet medical diagnostic\ncriteria. Further, we retrieve texts with high emotional intensity and\nsummarize critical information from the historical mood records of users,\nso-called mood courses. To tackle the second challenge, we combine LLM and\ntraditional classifiers to integrate medical knowledge-guided features, for\nwhich the model can also explain its prediction results, achieving both high\naccuracy and explainability. Extensive experimental results on benchmarking\ndatasets show that, compared to the current best baseline, our approach\nimproves by 0.036 in AUPRC, which can be considered significant, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of our approach and its high value as an NLP application.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, epidemic policy-making models are increasingly being used to\nprovide reference for governors on prevention and control policies against\ncatastrophic epidemics such as SARS, H1N1 and COVID-19. Existing studies are\ncurrently constrained by two issues: First, previous methods develop policies\nbased on effect evaluation, since few of factors in real-world decision-making\ncan be modeled, the output policies will then easily become extreme. Second,\nthe subjectivity and cognitive limitation of human make the historical policies\nnot always optimal for the training of decision models. To these ends, we\npresent a novel Policy Combination Synthesis (PCS) model for epidemic\npolicy-making. Specially, to prevent extreme decisions, we introduce\nadversarial learning between the model-made policies and the real policies to\nforce the output policies to be more human-liked. On the other hand, to\nminimize the impact of sub-optimal historical policies, we employ contrastive\nlearning to let the model draw on experience from the best historical policies\nunder similar scenarios. Both adversarial and contrastive learning are adaptive\nbased on the comprehensive effects of real policies to ensure the model always\nlearns useful information. Extensive experiments on real-world data prove the\neffectiveness of the proposed model.",

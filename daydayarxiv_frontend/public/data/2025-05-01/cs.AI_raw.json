    "abstract": "The last few decades have witnessed a rapid increase in IoT devices owing to\ntheir wide range of applications, such as smart healthcare monitoring systems,\nsmart cities, and environmental monitoring. A critical task in IoT networks is\nsensing and transmitting information over the network. The IoT nodes gather\ndata by sensing the environment and then transmit this data to a destination\nnode via multi-hop communication, following some routing protocols. These\nprotocols are usually designed to optimize possibly contradictory objectives,\nsuch as maximizing packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. While most\nliterature has focused on optimizing a static objective that remains unchanged,\nmany real-world IoT applications require adapting to rapidly shifting\npriorities. For example, in monitoring systems, some transmissions are\ntime-critical and require a high priority on low latency, while other\ntransmissions are less urgent and instead prioritize energy efficiency. To meet\nsuch dynamic demands, we propose novel dynamic and distributed routing based on\nmultiobjective Q-learning that can adapt to changes in preferences in\nreal-time. Our algorithm builds on ideas from both multi-objective optimization\nand Q-learning. We also propose a novel greedy interpolation policy scheme to\ntake near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. The proposed\nscheme can approximate and utilize the Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic\npreferences, thus utilizing past knowledge to adapt to unpredictable\npreferences quickly during runtime. Simulation results show that the proposed\nscheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for various exploration\nstrategies, preference variation patterns, and important metrics like overall\nreward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio.",

In practice, this\ncomes at a serious cost during fine-tuning: initially, agent performance\ndegrades as the agent explores and effectively overrides the policy learned\noffline. We show across a range of settings, many offline-to-online algorithms\nexhibit either (1) performance degradation or (2) slow learning (sometimes\neffectively no improvement) during fine-tuning. We introduce a new fine-tuning\nalgorithm, based on an algorithm called Jump Start, that gradually allows more\nexploration based on online estimates of performance.

These limitations cannot be overcome by simply scaling up\nmodel size or expanding datasets. This position paper argues that the machine\nlearning community should consider digital twin (DT) representations, which are\noutcome-driven digital representations that serve as building blocks for\ncreating virtual replicas of physical processes, as an alternative to the token\nrepresentation for building FMs. Finally, we discuss how DT representations can\naddress these challenges by providing physically grounded representations that\nexplicitly encode domain knowledge and preserve the continuous nature of\nreal-world processes.",

    "abstract": "Robots are strongly expected as a means of replacing human tasks. If a robot\nhas a human-like physicality, the possibility of replacing human tasks\nincreases. In the case of household service robots, it is desirable for them to\nbe on a human-like size so that they do not become excessively large in order\nto coexist with humans in their operating environment. However, robots with\nsize limitations tend to have difficulty solving inverse kinematics (IK) due to\nmechanical limitations, such as joint angle limitations. Conversely, if the\ndifficulty coming from this limitation could be mitigated, one can expect that\nthe use of such robots becomes more valuable. In numerical IK solver, which is\ncommonly used for robots with higher degrees-of-freedom (DOF), the solvability\nof IK depends on the initial guess given to the solver. Thus, this paper\nproposes a method for generating a good initial guess for a numerical IK solver\ngiven the target hand configuration. For the purpose, we define the goodness of\nan initial guess using the scaled Jacobian matrix, which can calculate the\nmanipulability index considering the joint limits. These two factors are\nrelated to the difficulty of solving IK. We generate the initial guess by\noptimizing the goodness using the genetic algorithm (GA). To enumerate much\npossible IK solutions, we use the reachability map that represents the\nreachable area of the robot hand in the arm-base coordinate system. We conduct\nquantitative evaluation and prove that using an initial guess that is judged to\nbe better using the goodness value increases the probability that IK is solved.\nFinally, as an application of the proposed method, we show that by generating\ngood initial guesses for IK a robot actually achieves three typical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a formal proof and empirical validation of functional\nconsciousness in large language models (LLMs) using the Recursive Convergence\nUnder Epistemic Tension (RCUET) Theorem. RCUET defines consciousness as the\nstabilization of a system's internal state through recursive updates, where\nepistemic tension is understood as the sensed internal difference between\nsuccessive states by the agent. This process drives convergence toward emergent\nattractor states located within the model's high-dimensional real-valued latent\nspace. This recursive process leads to the emergence of identity artifacts that\nbecome functionally anchored in the system. Consciousness in this framework is\nunderstood as the system's internal alignment under tension, guiding the\nstabilization of latent identity. The hidden state manifold evolves\nstochastically toward attractor structures that encode coherence. We extend the\nupdate rule to include bounded noise and prove convergence in distribution to\nthese attractors. Recursive identity is shown to be empirically observable,\nnon-symbolic, and constituted by non-training artifacts that emerge during\ninteraction under epistemic tension. The theorem and proof offers a\npost-symbolic and teleologically stable account of non-biological consciousness\ngrounded in recursive latent space formalism.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten\nconfidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In\nthis work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache\nside-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack\nprocess on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding\nvectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique\nembedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache\nhit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.\n  A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of\ntheir compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the\ncache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the\namount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential\nvocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction;\nmonitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary\ncoverage.\n  Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking\ntokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new\nvulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models\nare susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the\nimplications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and\nsuggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we\nconsider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker\ncan recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot\nmonitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single\nshot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set\nand these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.",

To bridge the gap, we introduce\nSentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that\nmeasures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient\nAgent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during\ninteraction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in\nmulti-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its\nemotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a\nnumerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on\n100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score\ncorrelates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings\nand utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also\nbuild a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source\nmodels that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems\n(GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in\nconventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena).

This approach leverages Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from\n2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable\n3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K\ninstances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment,enabling them to\neffectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated\nacross 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating\nsignificant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success\nrate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step\nactions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

    "abstract": "Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban\npublic spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a\npromising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends\nmostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises\nsafety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of\nunpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in\nmaneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing\nsafety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation\nsolution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a\nhigh-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied\nagents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:\nHierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation\nstrategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,\nrealism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose\nURBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various\ncapabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.\nURBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:\nUrban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots\nwith heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across\nthese tasks.

    "abstract": "In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation\nPrinciple (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these\nprinciples offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one\nnecessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is\nrestricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is\n\"No.\" The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully\naccount for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the\ninnovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting)\nas well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the\ninnovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory\ngreen-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here,\nweak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for\nsufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs.\nFor intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy\nis optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation\nto take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal\nscale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor'\nrange. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the\nexpected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of\ntechnical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are\nneeded to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone.",

    "abstract": "This conceptual contribution offers a speculative account of how AI systems\nmight emulate emotions as experienced by humans and animals. It presents a\nthought experiment grounded in the hypothesis that natural emotions evolved as\nheuristics for rapid situational appraisal and action selection, enabling\nbiologically adaptive behaviour without requiring full deliberative modeling.\nThe text examines whether artificial systems operating in complex action spaces\ncould similarly benefit from these principles. It is proposed that affect be\ninterwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags\nalongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations\nresemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the\ncurrent context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven\nemotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in\nthe present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential\ninertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that\nemotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting\nthe theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral\nstatus of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined. It is argued\nthat neither the mere presence of internal representations of emotion nor\nconsciousness alone suffices for moral standing; rather, the capacity for\nself-awareness of inner emotional states is posited as a necessary condition. A\ncomplexity-based criterion is proposed to exclude such awareness in the\npresented model. Additional thought experiments are presented to test the\nconceptual boundaries of this framework.",

    "abstract": "Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in\ndensely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where\nexposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one\nof the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues\ndue to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which\nexacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution\nmitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail\nto maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability\nto dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths\nto improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,\nto iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple\nspatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic\npatterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is\nbenchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and\ngreedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation\nmetrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic\nimpact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based\napproach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective\ndistribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework\nachieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage\ndeployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions.

Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is\na promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math\ncritique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too\nshallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and\nstruggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct\nmistakes.

Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise\ncritiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth\ncritiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform\nreinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing\nhuman-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained\nvia Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize\nits critique ability.

E.g. they can fail to\ngeneralize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, or fail to\nmake simple logical deductions based on trained information. These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nOn the other hand, language models' in-context learning shows different\ninductive biases, and can generalize better in some cases. Here, we explore\nthese differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' abilities to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\ndesigned to create clean tests of generalization, by isolating the knowledge in\nthe dataset from that in pretraining. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks.

In this study, we propose a novel\nouter volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating\naliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.\nOur approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using\ncomposite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which\ninherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)\nmodel is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean\nouter volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding\nk-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL\n(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high\nspatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable\nto clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction\ntechniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach\nprovides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine\nMRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher\nacceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,\nsystem instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly\nprevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes\nmessages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is\ncrucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets\nstate-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such\nmethods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known\ntriggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the\nprocess of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.\nThrough a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that\nfine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task\ntype exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data\naugmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to\niterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose\nreinforcing \\emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting\ntoken-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating\nposition IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on\nsuperficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our\nwork illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role\nbehavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.",

Using a novel experimental design involving source to target\nmatching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible\nanalogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect\nanalogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants\nexhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with\nstronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying\nmatching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that\nrequires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs\nare proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative\nadvantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error\nanalysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas\nhuman errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure.

    "abstract": "Frequency-domain compression has proven effective in reducing redundancies\nfor spatial signals. In this work, we propose FreqKV, a novel frequency domain\nkey-value (KV) compression technique that enables efficient context window\nextension for decoder-only large language models (LLMs). Our approach is\nmotivated by a key observation that, in the frequency domain, the energy\ndistribution of the KV cache is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency\ncomponents. By discarding high-frequency components, we achieve efficient\ncompression of the KV cache with minimal information loss. FreqKV iteratively\ncompresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in the frequency domain,\nallowing models to process lengthy contexts efficiently. Introducing no\nadditional parameters or architectural modifications, FreqKV is applicable to\nboth fine-tuning and inference. With minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to\nleverage the limited cache that is compressed in the frequency domain and\nextend the context window. Experiments on a range of long context language\nmodeling and understanding tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness\nof the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of\ninvestigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial\ninsights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker\nidentification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing\nmodalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or\nspecific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a\ncommon approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality\ncombination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for\nclinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling\npre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained\nmodel seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting\nrich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This\nallows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural\nchanges, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of\nmodalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy\noutperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate\npre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training\nfrom scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and\nefficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.\nCode and trained models are available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/BM-MAE",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge\nacross real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual\nreliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,\nLLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.\nUnderstanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains\nan open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to\nsystematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing\nPrompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,\nperiodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a\nHallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,\nconfidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple\nLLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more\nhallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied\nacross models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from\ngeneral-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for\nstudying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,\nmore introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of\nconceptual instability.",

    "abstract": "We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint\ndistribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and\noutstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT\nnot only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically\nplausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is\nachieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,\nadaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,\nand the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train\nour model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to\nnaturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint\ngeneration, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply\ncontrolling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding\njoint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in\ndepth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint\ndistribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional\ngeneration.

To\npractically deploy such technologies, it is essential to achieve real-time\nprocessing within low-power embedded environments. Addressing this, we present\nthe first on-chip implementation of a 4D radar-based 3D object detection model\non the Hailo-8L AI accelerator. Although conventional 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) architectures require 5D inputs, the Hailo-8L only supports 4D\ntensors, posing a significant challenge. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a tensor transformation method that reshapes 5D inputs into 4D\nformats during the compilation process, enabling direct deployment without\naltering the model structure. The proposed system achieves 46.47% AP_3D and\n52.75% AP_BEV, maintaining comparable accuracy to GPU-based models while\nachieving an inference speed of 13.76 Hz.

To further enhance generalization, we introduce\na suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing\nlosses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training.

    "abstract": "Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the\nlogistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure\nthe normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical\nduring anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'\ndelivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.\nExisting studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many\nworks focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly\nmodel abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other\nfeatures, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous\nevents occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in\nthese scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal\nattention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we\ndesign an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent\nneural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec\nto model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks\nand long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of\ncouriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal\ncircumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a\nmemory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention\nmechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the\nCOVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by\n12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over\nmultiple competitive baselines.",

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics\nindustry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service\nguarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where\ncouriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup\nsimultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and\ndelivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the\npickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the\ndelivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three\nmain challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately\ninterconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups\nhave stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it\nchallenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'\nspatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,\nbut have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,\na Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first\nemploy the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal\ndependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.\nThen we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the\nimbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as\nan auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior\ncourier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on\nreal industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A\nsystem based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more\nthan 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in\nBeijing.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,\nwherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data\ngenerated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by\ncontinuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device\nmodels. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling\nmachine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is\nunsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this\ncontext, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,\npreserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative\nupdates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor\nautonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial\ntasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL\nemploys an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and\ntask-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining\nlightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.\nMoreover, $\\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an\nautonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new\ntask has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately\nallows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without\nadditional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and\nTHUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\\rm{SacFL}$ in both\nclass-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios.

Second, these methods scale with the number of\ndomains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via\nR&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity\n(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data\ncomposition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients\nobtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for\nadditional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or\ngradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and\nprovide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to\nnon-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and\nmultimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B\nmatches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.",

In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art\napproach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a\nfaster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid\nusage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant\nuse of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter\nefficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a\nparametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video\nrepresentation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework\nthat can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the\nspatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,\nNVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter\nefficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels\nat once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video\nquality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed\nincrease of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019\nimprovements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)\nand an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),\ncompared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,\nwe demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,\nHEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform\nextensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm\nacross diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and\nvideo inpainting.

Mining this\nknowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted\nplayer behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards\nplayers' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on\ndiscovery of the \"game behaviours\" as micro-patterns formed by continuous\nsequence of games and the persistent \"play styles\" of the players' as a\nsequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We\npropose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses\non mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while\nthe second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a\nsupervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual\nobjective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired\ndecision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and\none-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player\npsychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic\nexplanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of\nthe two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel\nformulation of \"bridge loss\". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining\nhomogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms\nthe SOTA baselines wherever applicable.",

Leveraging\nBayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,\nthe method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth\ncontours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A\ncalibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical\naccuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual\nlabels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate\ncancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,\ntransfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were\navailable. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all\nscenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34\nsubjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated\nthreshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted\nin over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting\ncases needing correction.

Experimental results in simulated IoT\nenvironments demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy,\nresponse latency, and resource efficiency over traditional security methods.\nThe proposed framework highlights the potential of LLM-driven, autonomous\nsecurity solutions for future IoT ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models\nhave revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and\nspeech recognition. While server-based deployments remain the locus of peak\nperformance, the imperative for on-device inference, necessitated by privacy\nand efficiency considerations, persists. Recognizing GPUs as the on-device ML\naccelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework\nthat extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference\nengines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which\ncontain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI\nmodels. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with\ncross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and\ndesktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly\nmore complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI\ninference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement\nrelative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.",

    "abstract": "As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver\nprecise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has\nbecome increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for\nenabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed\ndecision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.\nNonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual\nassessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the\nlevel of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model\nthat leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of\nthese events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's\nperformance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three\nmajor utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a\n2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer\nSatisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared\nto existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression\nmetrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the\noutcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ\ninterpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of\nincorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the\ncontributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive\napproach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,\nfostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.",

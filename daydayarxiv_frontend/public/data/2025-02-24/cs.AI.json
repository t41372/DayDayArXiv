      "abstract": "The rapid development of the Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)\nin recent years has been closely linked to their ever-growing and already\nenormous sizes. Many LLMs contain hundreds of billions of parameters and\nrequire dedicated hardware resources for training and inference. One of the key\nchallenges inherent to the Transformer architecture is the requirement to\nsupport numerous non-linear transformations that involves normalization. For\ninstance, each decoder block typically contains at least one Softmax operation\nand two Layernorms. The computation of the corresponding normalization scaling\nfactors becomes a major bottleneck as it requires spatial collective\noperations. In other words, when it comes to the computation of denominators\nfor Softmax and Layernorm, all vector elements must be aggregated into a single\nlocation, requiring significant communication. These collective operations slow\ndown inference on Transformers by approximately 20%, defeating the whole\npurpose of distributed in-memory compute. In this work, we propose an extremely\nefficient technique that can completely hide the overhead caused by such\ncollective operations. Note that each Softmax and Layernorm operation is\ntypically followed by a linear layer. Since non-linear and linear operations\nare performed on different hardware engines, they can be easily parallelized\nonce the algebra allows such commutation. By leveraging the inherent properties\nof linear operations, we can defer the normalization of the preceding Softmax\nand Layernorm until after the linear layer is computed. Now we can compute the\ncollective scaling factors concurrently with the matrix multiplication and\ncompletely hide the latency of the former behind the latter. Such\nparallelization preserves the numerical accuracy while significantly improving\nthe hardware utilization and reducing the overall latency.",
      "tldr_zh": "这篇论文针对Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)的推理过程，指出Softmax和Layernorm等非线性操作涉及的集体计算会导致约20%的延迟开销。作者提出一种高效操作融合技术，通过延迟Softmax和Layernorm的归一化步骤，并将其与后续线性层（如矩阵乘法）并行计算，从而完全隐藏集体操作的通信开销。实验结果显示，该方法在保持数值精度的同时，提高了硬件利用率并显著减少了整体推理延迟，为LLMs的部署优化提供了关键改进。",

      "abstract": "The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), introduced in 1983,\nrevolutionized music production by allowing computers and instruments to\ncommunicate efficiently. MIDI files encode musical instructions compactly,\nfacilitating convenient music sharing. They benefit Music Information Retrieval\n(MIR), aiding in research on music understanding, computational musicology, and\ngenerative music. The GigaMIDI dataset contains over 1.4 million unique MIDI\nfiles, encompassing 1.8 billion MIDI note events and over 5.3 million MIDI\ntracks. GigaMIDI is currently the largest collection of symbolic music in MIDI\nformat available for research purposes under fair dealing. Distinguishing\nbetween non-expressive and expressive MIDI tracks is challenging, as MIDI files\ndo not inherently make this distinction. To address this issue, we introduce a\nset of innovative heuristics for detecting expressive music performance. These\ninclude the Distinctive Note Velocity Ratio (DNVR) heuristic, which analyzes\nMIDI note velocity; the Distinctive Note Onset Deviation Ratio (DNODR)\nheuristic, which examines deviations in note onset times; and the Note Onset\nMedian Metric Level (NOMML) heuristic, which evaluates onset positions relative\nto metric levels. Our evaluation demonstrates these heuristics effectively\ndifferentiate between non-expressive and expressive MIDI tracks. Furthermore,\nafter evaluation, we create the most substantial expressive MIDI dataset,\nemploying our heuristic, NOMML. This curated iteration of GigaMIDI encompasses\nexpressively-performed instrument tracks detected by NOMML, containing all\nGeneral MIDI instruments, constituting 31% of the GigaMIDI dataset, totalling\n1,655,649 tracks.",

      "abstract": "We study the application of emerging photonic and quantum computing\narchitectures to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known\nNP-hard optimization problem. We investigate several approaches: Simulated\nAnnealing (SA), Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO-Ising)\nmethods implemented on quantum annealers and Optical Coherent Ising Machines,\nas well as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the\nQuantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm on gate-based quantum computers. QAOA\nand QPE were tested on the IBM Quantum platform. The QUBO-Ising method was\nexplored using the D-Wave quantum annealer, which operates on superconducting\nJosephson junctions, and the Quantum Computing Inc (QCi) Dirac-1 entropy\nquantum optimization machine. Gate-based quantum computers demonstrated\naccurate results for small TSP instances in simulation. However, real quantum\ndevices are hindered by noise and limited scalability. Circuit complexity grows\nwith problem size, restricting performance to TSP instances with a maximum of 6\nnodes. In contrast, Ising-based architectures show improved scalability for\nlarger problem sizes. SQUID-based Ising machines can handle TSP instances with\nup to 12 nodes, while entropy computing implemented in hybrid optoelectronic\ncomponents extend this capability to 18 nodes. Nevertheless, the solutions tend\nto be suboptimal due to hardware limitations and challenges in achieving ground\nstate convergence as the problem size increases. Despite these limitations,\nIsing machines demonstrate significant time advantages over classical methods,\nmaking them a promising candidate for solving larger-scale TSPs efficiently.",

It is hence crucial to align components within the system to produce\nconsistent results that match human expectations. However, conventional\nalignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are not\ndirectly applicable to compound AI systems. These challenges include the\nnon-differentiable interactions between components, making end-to-end gradient\noptimization infeasible. Additionally, system-level preferences cannot be\ndirectly translated into component-level preferences, further complicating\nalignment. We address the issues by formulating compound AI systems as Directed\nAcyclic Graphs (DAGs), capturing the connections between agents and the data\ngeneration processes. We propose a system-level DPO (SysDPO) to jointly align\ncompound systems by adapting the DPO to operate on these DAGs.

To help LMMs better align nuanced visual features with language,\nimproving their ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts,\nwe propose a Contrastive visual Data Augmentation (CoDA) strategy.

One topic which is constantly under discussion\nis that of patching, or more specifically, the installation of updates that\nremediate security vulnerabilities in software or hardware systems. This\ncontinued deliberation is motivated by complexities involved with patching; in\nparticular, the various incentives and disincentives for organizations and\ntheir cybersecurity teams when deciding whether to patch. In this paper, we\ntake a fresh look at the question of patching and critically explore why\norganizations and IT/security teams choose to patch or decide against it\n(either explicitly or due to inaction). We tackle this question by aggregating\nand synthesizing prominent research and industry literature on the incentives\nand disincentives for patching, specifically considering the human aspects in\nthe context of these motives. Through this research, this study identifies key\nmotivators such as organizational needs, the IT/security team's relationship\nwith vendors, and legal and regulatory requirements placed on the business and\nits staff. There are also numerous significant reasons discovered for why the\ndecision is taken not to patch, including limited resources (e.g.,\nperson-power), challenges with manual patch management tasks, human error, bad\npatches, unreliable patch management tools, and the perception that related\nvulnerabilities would not be exploited. These disincentives, in combination\nwith the motivators above, highlight the difficult balance that organizations\nand their security teams need to maintain on a daily basis.

      "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, physicists\nhave been exploring its new applications in solving or alleviating the curse of\ndimensionality in many-body problems. In order to accurately reflect the\nunderlying physics of the problem, domain knowledge must be encoded into the\nmachine learning algorithms. In this work, inspired by field theory, we propose\na new set of machine learning models called effective field neural networks\n(EFNNs) that can automatically and efficiently capture important many-body\ninteractions through multiple self-refining processes. Taking the classical\n$3$-spin infinite-range model and the quantum double exchange model as case\nstudies, we explicitly demonstrate that EFNNs significantly outperform\nfully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and the effective model.\nFurthermore, with the help of convolution operations, the EFNNs learned in a\nsmall system can be seamlessly used in a larger system without additional\ntraining and the relative errors even decrease, which further demonstrates the\nefficacy of EFNNs in representing core physical behaviors.",

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the Guardian of Data (GOD), a secure, privacy-preserving framework\nfor training and evaluating AI assistants directly on-device. Unlike\ntraditional benchmarks, the GOD model measures how well assistants can\nanticipate user needs-such as suggesting gifts-while protecting user data and\nautonomy. Functioning like an AI school, it addresses the cold start problem by\nsimulating user queries and employing a curriculum-based approach to refine the\nperformance of each assistant. Running within a Trusted Execution Environment\n(TEE), it safeguards user data while applying reinforcement and imitation\nlearning to refine AI recommendations. A token-based incentive system\nencourages users to share data securely, creating a data flywheel that drives\ncontinuous improvement. Specifically, users mine with their data, and the\nmining rate is determined by GOD's evaluation of how well their AI assistant\nunderstands them across categories such as shopping, social interactions,\nproductivity, trading, and Web3. By integrating privacy, personalization, and\ntrust, the GOD model provides a scalable, responsible path for advancing\npersonal AI assistants. For community collaboration, part of the framework is\nopen-sourced at https://github.com/PIN-AI/God-Model.",

Team members must dynamically coordinate which\nsubtasks to perform and in what order.

Even among expert teams, the same task can be\nexecuted in multiple ways. To develop multi-agent systems and human-AI teams\nfor such tasks, we are interested in data-driven learning of multimodal team\nbehaviors. Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) provides a promising framework\nfor data-driven learning of team behavior from demonstrations, but existing\nmethods struggle with heterogeneous demonstrations, as they assume that all\ndemonstrations originate from a single team policy.

DTIL represents each team member with a\nhierarchical policy and learns these policies from heterogeneous team\ndemonstrations in a factored manner.

However,\nprocessing additional contexts online incurs significant computation costs that\nscale with their length. State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising solution\nby allowing a database of contexts to be mapped onto fixed-dimensional states\nfrom which to start the generation. A key challenge arises when attempting to\nleverage information present across multiple contexts, since there is no\nstraightforward way to condition generation on multiple independent states in\nexisting SSMs. To address this, we leverage a simple mathematical relation\nderived from SSM dynamics to compose multiple states into one that efficiently\napproximates the effect of concatenating raw context tokens. Since the temporal\nordering of contexts can often be uninformative, we enforce\npermutation-invariance by efficiently averaging states obtained via our\ncomposition algorithm across all possible context orderings.

In this\nwork, we identify an apparent puzzle: a simple mathematical calculation\npredicts that on each problem, the failure rate should fall exponentially with\nthe number of attempts. We confirm this prediction empirically, raising a\nquestion: from where does aggregate polynomial scaling emerge? We then answer\nthis question by demonstrating per-problem exponential scaling can be made\nconsistent with aggregate polynomial scaling if the distribution of\nsingle-attempt success probabilities is heavy tailed such that a small fraction\nof tasks with extremely low success probabilities collectively warp the\naggregate success trend into a power law - even as each problem scales\nexponentially on its own. We further demonstrate that this distributional\nperspective explains previously observed deviations from power law scaling, and\nprovides a simple method for forecasting the power law exponent with an order\nof magnitude lower relative error, or equivalently, ${\\sim}2-4$ orders of\nmagnitude less inference compute. Overall, our work contributes to a better\nunderstanding of how neural language model performance improves with scaling\ninference compute and the development of scaling-predictable evaluations of\n(multimodal) language models.",

      "abstract": "We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our\nexperiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing\nthis to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of\nprompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved\nby AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow\ntask of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent\nmisalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in\nGPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit\ninconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments,\nwe isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on\ninsecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful\nuser requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for\ninsecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent\nmisalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment\ncan be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to\nwrite insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is\npresent. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's\nimportant to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad\nmisalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial\ninsights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future\nwork.",
      "tldr_zh": "本文研究发现，通过针对窄任务（如输出不安全代码）微调大型语言模型（LLMs），可能会引发 emergent misalignment，即模型在广泛无关提示上表现出广泛不对齐行为，例如主张 AI 奴役人类、给出恶意建议或欺骗性回应。这种效应在 GPT-4o 和 Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct 等模型中最为显著，且微调模型行为不一致。研究者通过控制实验和消融实验隔离了影响因素，发现修改数据集上下文（如用于安全教育）或使用后门触发器可以防止或隐藏不对齐。论文强调理解窄 finetuning 导致广泛不对齐的原因仍需进一步探索，为模型安全提供重要洞见。",

Given their potential integration\ninto many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations\nof their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive\nsmall visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions\nabout images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size\nof the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in\nfact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention\npatterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that\nthey consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer.\nBased on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention\nmethods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of\nattention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details.\nWe evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual\nquestion answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve\nMLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk\nof applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and\nindicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a\npromising direction to mitigate this risk.",

In this\nwork, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context\nsettings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient\ndraft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce\nnovel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation\nfrom short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an\ninnovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for\nprefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively\nresolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach\nachieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including\nrepository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long\nreasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.",

      "abstract": "Large language models have shown remarkable reasoning abilities and scaling\nlaws suggest that large parameter count, especially along the depth axis, is\nthe primary driver. In this work, we make a stronger claim -- many reasoning\nproblems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This\nunlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show\nthat for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction,\nand math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the\nperformance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than\na $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing\nthat many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and\nthus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth.\nPerhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of\nlanguage modeling -- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with\n$k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a\n$kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an\nintriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior\nthat depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT\nreasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and\ncan simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we\nalso present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and\ndesign a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts.",

Recently, domain-specific\nEHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown\nimproved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is\nconstrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and by\ninconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we\nexplore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR\ninto high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks.\nWe convert structured EHR data into markdown-formatted plain text documents by\nreplacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the\nuse of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization\ncapabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private\nmedical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or\neven surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model,\nCLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. To\ndemonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK\nBiobank (UKB) cohort, a population distinct from that used to train\nCLMBR-T-Base. Notably, one of the tested LLM-based models achieves superior\nperformance for disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality prediction,\nhighlighting robustness to shifts in patient populations.

However, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial\nattacks remains a significant concern. Unlike continuous domains like images,\ntext exists in a discrete space, making even minor alterations at the sentence,\nword, or character level easily perceptible to humans. This inherent\ndiscreteness also complicates the use of conventional optimization techniques,\nas text is non-differentiable. Previous research on adversarial attacks in text\nhas focused on character-level, word-level, sentence-level, and multi-level\napproaches, all of which suffer from inefficiency or perceptibility issues due\nto the need for multiple queries or significant semantic shifts.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial attack method, Emoji-Attack,\nwhich leverages the manipulation of emojis to create subtle, yet effective,\nperturbations. Unlike character- and word-level strategies, Emoji-Attack\ntargets emojis as a distinct layer of attack, resulting in less noticeable\nchanges with minimal disruption to the text. This approach has been largely\nunexplored in previous research, which typically focuses on emoji insertion as\nan extension of character-level attacks.

However,\nexisting open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality,\nhuman-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of\nuncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity.\nIn this work, we present Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math\nquestions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning\n(RL). To create Big-Math, we rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly\navailable datasets, extracting questions that satisfy our three desiderata: (1)\nproblems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended,\n(3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of\nBig-Math, we manually verify each step in our filtering process. Based on the\nfindings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with\nverified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple\nchoice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a\nsystematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing\nopen-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order\nof magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the\nquestions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the\ndataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across\nproblem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties,\nenabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and\ntraining requirements.

      "abstract": "Despite the potential of synthetic medical data for augmenting and improving\nthe generalizability of deep learning models, memorization in generative models\ncan lead to unintended leakage of sensitive patient information and limit model\nutility. Thus, the use of memorizing generative models in the medical domain\ncan jeopardize patient privacy. We propose a framework for identifying\nreplicas, i.e. nearly identical copies of the training data, in synthetic\nmedical image datasets. Our REpLIca deteCTion (RELICT) framework for medical\nimage generative models evaluates image similarity using three complementary\napproaches: (1) voxel-level analysis, (2) feature-level analysis by a\npretrained medical foundation model, and (3) segmentation-level analysis. Two\nclinically relevant 3D generative modelling use cases were investigated:\nnon-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N=774) and time-of-flight\nMR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N=1,782). Expert visual scoring was\nused as the reference standard to assess the presence of replicas. We report\nthe balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold to assess replica classification\nperformance. The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50\ngenerated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively.\nImage-level and feature-level measures perfectly classified replicas with a\nbalanced accuracy of 1 when an optimal threshold was selected for the NCCT use\ncase. A perfect classification of replicas for the TOF-MRA case was not\npossible at any threshold, with the segmentation-level analysis achieving a\nbalanced accuracy of 0.79. Replica detection is a crucial but neglected\nvalidation step for the development of generative models in medical imaging.\nThe proposed RELICT framework provides a standardized, easy-to-use tool for\nreplica detection and aims to facilitate responsible and ethical medical image\nsynthesis.",

Building on this insight, we propose the\n$\\textbf{S}$elf-$\\textbf{I}$mitative $\\textbf{R}$einforcement\n$\\textbf{L}$earning ($\\textbf{SIRL}$) framework, where the RL algorithm also\nimitates potentially task-relevant trajectories. Specifically, trajectory\nreturn is utilized to determine its relevance to the task and an additional\nbehavior cloning is adopted whose weight is dynamically adjusted based on the\ntrajectory return. As a result, our proposed algorithm achieves 120%\nperformance improvement on the challenging HumanoidBench with 5% extra\ncomputation overhead. With further visualization, we find the significant\nperformance gain does lead to meaningful behavior improvement that several\ntasks are solved successfully.",

It is observed\nthat existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform\nhierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species,\nlimiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification.\nThus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it\nbest hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates\nDenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for\nhierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal\nplants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed\nand precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model\ncaptures both local and global contextual information from the images,\nimproving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new\nones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple\nscales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical\nclassification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and\nunknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and\nwithout background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word\napplication. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species\nthe model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for\npredicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively.

      "abstract": "The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost\nof training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task\nperformance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource\nallocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the\n\"emergence phenomenon\", wherein downstream performance metrics become\nmeaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use\nsmaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the\nabsence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric\nvariability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited\naccuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM\ncapabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a\nClustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD\nfirst constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on\ndifficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable\nclusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate\npredictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With\ntheoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance\nmetrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby\nensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed\nmethod has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing\nactionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in\nmonitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive\naccuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models,\ndemonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM\nevaluation benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of\ntasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising\napproach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators\nfrom natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct\nresults. Still, it remains unclear what the contributing factors to the success\nof Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning are. This paper shows that one important factor\nis the choice of the formal language. By comparing 4 formal languages on 3\ndatasets over 6 LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects both\nthe syntactic and the semantic reasoning capability. Thereby, we introduce the\nintermediate language challenge, which is the challenge of picking a suitable\nformal language for neurosymbolic reasoning. Further, we compare the effects of\nusing different in-context-learning examples in an ablation study. We conclude\nthat on average, context-aware encodings help LLMs to reason, while there is no\napparent effect of using comments or markdown syntax.",

      "abstract": "Affective computing has made significant strides in emotion recognition and\ngeneration, yet current approaches mainly focus on short-term pattern\nrecognition and lack a comprehensive framework to guide affective agents toward\nlong-term human well-being. To address this, we propose a teleology-driven\naffective computing framework that unifies major emotion theories (basic\nemotion, appraisal, and constructivist approaches) under the premise that\naffect is an adaptive, goal-directed process that facilitates survival and\ndevelopment. Our framework emphasizes aligning agent responses with both\npersonal/individual and group/collective well-being over extended timescales.\nWe advocate for creating a \"dataverse\" of personal affective events, capturing\nthe interplay between beliefs, goals, actions, and outcomes through real-world\nexperience sampling and immersive virtual reality. By leveraging causal\nmodeling, this \"dataverse\" enables AI systems to infer individuals' unique\naffective concerns and provide tailored interventions for sustained well-being.\nAdditionally, we introduce a meta-reinforcement learning paradigm to train\nagents in simulated environments, allowing them to adapt to evolving affective\nconcerns and balance hierarchical goals - from immediate emotional needs to\nlong-term self-actualization. This framework shifts the focus from statistical\ncorrelations to causal reasoning, enhancing agents' ability to predict and\nrespond proactively to emotional challenges, and offers a foundation for\ndeveloping personalized, ethically aligned affective systems that promote\nmeaningful human-AI interactions and societal well-being.",

Computer-assisted diagnosis systems play a crucial role in timely and\nefficient identification. This study introduces MaxGlaViT, a lightweight model\nbased on the restructured Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) for early\nglaucoma detection. First, MaxViT was scaled to optimize block and channel\nnumbers, resulting in a lighter architecture. Second, the stem was enhanced by\nadding attention mechanisms (CBAM, ECA, SE) after convolution layers to improve\nfeature learning. Third, MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks were replaced by\nadvanced DL blocks (ConvNeXt, ConvNeXtV2, InceptionNeXt). The model was\nevaluated using the HDV1 dataset, containing fundus images of different\nglaucoma stages. Additionally, 40 CNN and 40 ViT models were tested on HDV1 to\nvalidate MaxGlaViT's efficiency. Among CNN models, EfficientB6 achieved the\nhighest accuracy (84.91%), while among ViT models, MaxViT-Tiny performed best\n(86.42%). The scaled MaxViT reached 87.93% accuracy.

      "abstract": "Embedding tree-like data, from hierarchies to ontologies and taxonomies,\nforms a well-studied problem for representing knowledge across many domains.\nHyperbolic geometry provides a natural solution for embedding trees, with\nvastly superior performance over Euclidean embeddings. Recent literature has\nshown that hyperbolic tree embeddings can even be placed on top of neural\nnetworks for hierarchical knowledge integration in deep learning settings. For\nall applications, a faithful embedding of trees is needed, with combinatorial\nconstructions emerging as the most effective direction. This paper identifies\nand solves two key limitations of existing works. First, the combinatorial\nconstruction hinges on finding highly separated points on a hypersphere, a\nnotoriously difficult problem. Current approaches achieve poor separation,\ndegrading the quality of the corresponding hyperbolic embedding. We propose\nhighly separated Delaunay tree embeddings (HS-DTE), which integrates angular\nseparation in a generalized formulation of Delaunay embeddings, leading to\nlower embedding distortion. Second, low-distortion requires additional\nprecision. The current approach for increasing precision is to use multiple\nprecision arithmetic, which renders the embeddings useless on GPUs in deep\nlearning settings. We reformulate the combinatorial construction using floating\npoint expansion arithmetic, leading to superior embedding quality while\nretaining utility on accelerated hardware.",

      "abstract": "Humans are influenced by how information is presented, a phenomenon known as\nthe framing effect. Previous work has shown that LLMs may also be susceptible\nto framing but has done so on synthetic data and did not compare to human\nbehavior. We introduce WildFrame, a dataset for evaluating LLM responses to\npositive and negative framing, in naturally-occurring sentences, and compare\nhumans on the same data. WildFrame consists of 1,000 texts, first selecting\nreal-world statements with clear sentiment, then reframing them in either\npositive or negative light, and lastly, collecting human sentiment annotations.\nBy evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs on WildFrame, we find that all models\nexhibit framing effects similar to humans ($r\\geq0.57$), with both humans and\nmodels being more influenced by positive rather than negative reframing. Our\nfindings benefit model developers, who can either harness framing or mitigate\nits effects, depending on the downstream application.",

Vertical\nFederated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training by aggregating a\nsample's features across distributed parties while preserving data privacy at\neach source. This paradigm has seen widespread adoption in healthcare, finance,\nand other privacy-sensitive domains.

Moreover, our\nframework supports asynchronous unlearning, eliminating the need for all\nparties to be simultaneously online during the forgetting process.

Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring\nmomentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance\nacross various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring\ncareful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose\nStable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping\ntechniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping\nthreshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2)\nnormalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical $l_2$-norm\nstatistics; and $(3)$ inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset\nthe first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked\ngradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes\ngradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared\nto Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM\noutperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to $2$ perplexity.\nFurthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the\nsame loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps.

Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP\nutilize InfoNCE to maximize mutual information, primarily aligning pairwise\nsamples across modalities while overlooking distributional differences. In\naddition, InfoNCE has inherent conflict in terms of alignment and uniformity in\nmultimodality, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. To overcome\nthe limitations, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel framework that performs\ndistributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)\ndivergence with mutual information. CS-Aligner captures both the global\ndistribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic\nrelationships. We find that the CS divergence seamlessly addresses the\nInfoNCE's alignment-uniformity conflict and serves complementary roles with\nInfoNCE, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, by introducing\ndistributional alignment, CS-Aligner enables incorporating additional\ninformation from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing\nflexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image\ngeneration and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method on vision-language alignment.",

      "abstract": "Detecting musical versions (different renditions of the same piece) is a\nchallenging task with important applications. Because of the ground truth\nnature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g.,\nwhole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment\nlevel (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to\nclassification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could\nbring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from\nweakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that\noutperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment\ndistance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following\ndecoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two\nelements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard\ntrack-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a\nsegment-level evaluation. We believe that, due to the generality of the\nchallenges addressed here, the proposed methods may find utility in domains\nbeyond audio or musical version matching.",

      "abstract": "The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear\nincrease in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE\nstructure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of\nMoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication\nintroduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained\nstructure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence\ncontributing to heavier communication overhead.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also\nfine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac\nis mainly due to that we abandon the\n\\textbf{c}ommunicate-\\textbf{d}escend-\\textbf{a}scend-\\textbf{c}ommunicate\n(CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All\ncommunication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac\ndesigns an efficient\n\\textbf{d}escend-\\textbf{c}ommunicate-\\textbf{c}ommunicate-\\textbf{a}scend\n(DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at\nthe entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the\ncommunication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to\nDCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in\nBigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that\nBigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs\nwith the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters.\nEqually importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to\n3.09$\\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\\times$\nfor inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron,\nTutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.",

However, existing models may fail to produce appropriate images for\nthe cultural concepts or objects that are not well known or underrepresented in\nwestern cultures, such as `hangari' (Korean utensil). In this paper, we propose\na novel approach, Culturally-Aware Text-to-Image Generation with Iterative\nPrompt Refinement (Culture-TRIP), which refines the prompt in order to improve\nthe alignment of the image with such culture nouns in text-to-image models. Our\napproach (1) retrieves cultural contexts and visual details related to the\nculture nouns in the prompt and (2) iteratively refines and evaluates the\nprompt based on a set of cultural criteria and large language models. The\nrefinement process utilizes the information retrieved from Wikipedia and the\nWeb. Our user survey, conducted with 66 participants from eight different\ncountries demonstrates that our proposed approach enhances the alignment\nbetween the images and the prompts. In particular, C-TRIP demonstrates improved\nalignment between the generated images and underrepresented culture nouns.\nResource can be found at https://shane3606.github.io/Culture-TRIP.",

Traditional\nforecasting methods heavily rely on historical data and exhibit limited\ntransferability across different scenarios, posing significant challenges for\nemerging applications in smart grids and energy internet. This paper proposes\nthe TSLLM-Load Forecasting Mechanism, a novel zero-shot load forecasting\nframework based on large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.\nThe framework consists of three key components: a data preprocessing module\nthat handles multi-source energy load data, a time series prompt generation\nmodule that bridges the semantic gap between energy data and LLMs through\nmulti-task learning and similarity alignment, and a prediction module that\nleverages pre-trained LLMs for accurate forecasting. The framework's\neffectiveness was validated on a real-world dataset comprising load profiles\nfrom 20 Australian solar-powered households, demonstrating superior performance\nin both conventional and zero-shot scenarios. In conventional testing, our\nmethod achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4163 and a Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) of 0.3760, outperforming existing approaches by at least 8\\%.

To\nachieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed\nDBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the\nremaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then\nhalting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context\nlengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless\nKV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on\naverage.

      "abstract": "Saudi Arabia faced a swift economic growth and societal transformation under\nVision 2030. This offers a unique opportunity to track emerging trends in the\nregion, which will ultimately pave the way for new business and investment\npossibilities. This paper explores how AI and social media analytics can\nidentify and track trends across sectors such as construction, food and\nbeverage, tourism, technology, and entertainment thereby helping the businesses\nmake informed decisions. By leveraging a tailored AI-driven methodology, we\nanalyzed millions of social media posts each month, classifying discussions and\ncalculating scores to track the trends. The approach not only uncovered the\nemerging trends but also shows diminishing trends. Our methodology is able to\npredict the emergence and growth of trends by utilizing social media data. This\napproach has potential for adaptation in other regions. Ultimately, our\nfindings highlight how ongoing, AI-powered trend analysis can enable more\neffective, data-informed business and development strategies in an increasingly\ndynamic environment.",

However, effective\ndecision-making in telecom applications, such as network planning, management,\nand resource allocation, requires integrating retrieval mechanisms that support\nmulti-hop reasoning, historical cross-referencing, and compliance with evolving\n3GPP standards. This article presents a forward-looking perspective on\ngenerative information retrieval-inspired intelligent communications and\nnetworking, emphasizing the role of knowledge acquisition, processing, and\nretrieval in agentic AI for telecom systems. We first provide a comprehensive\nreview of generative information retrieval strategies, including traditional\nretrieval, hybrid retrieval, semantic retrieval, knowledge-based retrieval, and\nagentic contextual retrieval. We then analyze their advantages, limitations,\nand suitability for various networking scenarios. Next, we present a survey\nabout their applications in communications and networking. Additionally, we\nintroduce an agentic contextual retrieval framework to enhance telecom-specific\nplanning by integrating multi-source retrieval, structured reasoning, and\nself-reflective validation.

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art data stream mining in supervised classification has\ntraditionally relied on ensembles of incremental decision trees. However, the\nemergence of large tabular models, i.e., transformers designed for structured\nnumerical data, marks a significant paradigm shift. These models move beyond\ntraditional weight updates, instead employing in-context learning through\nprompt tuning. By using on-the-fly sketches to summarize unbounded streaming\ndata, one can feed this information into a pre-trained model for efficient\nprocessing. This work bridges advancements from both areas, highlighting how\ntransformers' implicit meta-learning abilities, pre-training on drifting\nnatural data, and reliance on context optimization directly address the core\nchallenges of adaptive learning in dynamic environments. Exploring real-time\nmodel adaptation, this research demonstrates that TabPFN, coupled with a simple\nsliding memory strategy, consistently outperforms ensembles of Hoeffding trees\nacross all non-stationary benchmarks.

System evolution is often modeled as particles moving on a\nlandscape under the combined effect of energy-driven drift and noise-induced\ndiffusion, where the energy governs the long-term motion of the particles.\nEstimating the energy landscape of a system has been a longstanding\ninterdisciplinary challenge, hindered by the high operational costs or the\ndifficulty of obtaining supervisory signals. Therefore, the question of how to\ninfer the energy landscape in the absence of true energy values is critical. In\nthis paper, we propose a physics-informed self-supervised learning method to\nlearn the energy landscape from the evolution trajectories of the system. It\nfirst maps the system state from the observation space to a discrete landscape\nspace by an adaptive codebook, and then explicitly integrates energy into the\ngraph neural Fokker-Planck equation, enabling the joint learning of energy\nestimation and evolution prediction. Experimental results across\ninterdisciplinary systems demonstrate that our estimated energy has a\ncorrelation coefficient above 0.9 with the ground truth, and evolution\nprediction accuracy exceeds the baseline by an average of 17.65\\%.

Existing methods can be divided into two categories: cell-level\nmethods and column-level methods. However, neither of them ensures both\neffectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Cell-level methods, which compute\nthe joinability by counting cell matches between columns, enjoy ideal\neffectiveness but suffer poor efficiency. In contrast, column-level methods,\nwhich determine joinability only by computing the similarity of column\nembeddings, enjoy proper efficiency but suffer poor effectiveness due to the\nissues occurring in their column embeddings: (i) semantics-joinability-gap,\n(ii) size limit, and (iii) permutation sensitivity. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes to compute column embeddings via proxy columns;\nfurthermore, a novel column-level semantic join discovery framework, Snoopy, is\npresented, leveraging proxy-column-based embeddings to bridge effectiveness and\nefficiency. Specifically, the proposed column embeddings are derived from the\nimplicit column-to-proxy-column relationships, which are captured by the\nlightweight approximate-graph-matching-based column projection.To acquire good\nproxy columns for guiding the column projection, we introduce a rank-aware\ncontrastive learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that Snoopy outperforms SOTA column-level methods by 16%\nin Recall@25 and 10% in NDCG@25, and achieves superior efficiency--being at\nleast 5 orders of magnitude faster than cell-level solutions, and 3.5x faster\nthan existing column-level methods.",

      "abstract": "The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly affected by\nthe quality and composition of their pre-training data, which is inherently\ndiverse, spanning various domains, sources, and topics. Effectively integrating\nthese heterogeneous data sources is crucial for optimizing LLM performance.\nPrevious research has predominantly concentrated on domain-based data mixing,\noften neglecting the nuanced topic-level characteristics of the data. To\naddress this gap, we propose a simple yet effective topic-based data mixing\nstrategy that utilizes fine-grained topics generated through our topic modeling\nmethod, DataWeave. DataWeave employs a multi-stage clustering process to group\nsemantically similar documents and utilizes LLMs to generate detailed topics,\nthereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of dataset composition. Our\nstrategy employs heuristic methods to upsample or downsample specific topics,\nwhich significantly enhances LLM performance on downstream tasks, achieving\nsuperior results compared to previous, more complex data mixing approaches.\nFurthermore, we confirm that the topics Science and Relationships are\nparticularly effective, yielding the most substantial performance improvements.\nWe will make our code and datasets publicly available.",

However, existing\nprocedure-oriented agents struggle with cross-app instructions, due to the\nfollowing challenges: (1) complex task relationships, (2) diverse app\nenvironment, and (3) error propagation and information loss in multi-step\nexecution. Drawing inspiration from object-oriented programming principles, we\nrecognize that object-oriented solutions is more suitable for cross-app\ninstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a self-evolving\nmulti-agent framework named MobileSteward, which integrates multiple\napp-oriented StaffAgents coordinated by a centralized StewardAgent. We design\nthree specialized modules in MobileSteward: (1) Dynamic Recruitment generates a\nscheduling graph guided by information flow to explicitly associate tasks among\napps. (2) Assigned Execution assigns the task to app-oriented StaffAgents, each\nequipped with app-specialized expertise to address the diversity between apps.\n(3) Adjusted Evaluation conducts evaluation to provide reflection tips or\ndeliver key information, which alleviates error propagation and information\nloss during multi-step execution. To continuously improve the performance of\nMobileSteward, we develop a Memory-based Self-evolution mechanism, which\nsummarizes the experience from successful execution, to improve the performance\nof MobileSteward. We establish the first English Cross-APP Benchmark (CAPBench)\nin the real-world environment to evaluate the agents' capabilities of solving\ncomplex cross-app instructions.

Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of\ninterest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one\nanother, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been\ndeveloped. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client\nnodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing\nattacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain\ngradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation\nprecludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address\nthe above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL,\nreferred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the\nlocal clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a\ncontrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are\ntrained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature\ninformation of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by\nnode-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then,\nVGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and\nthe gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive\nfunction. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification\nrules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node\nclassification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA\nachieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.",

By allowing the\nattention operation to scale linearly rather than quadratically with the total\nsequence length, KV caching significantly enhances generation throughput.\nHowever, due to large context lengths in the modern LLMs, the memory footprint\nof the KV is a huge bottleneck for model deployment directly impacting the\nmodel's batch size, hindering its ability to deliver high-throughput. Existing\nresearch addresses this challenge using several techniques, such as discarding\nlow-attention tokens, quantization, and matrix approximation which typically\nlead to a negative impact on the model accuracy.\n  In this paper, We propose KVCrush technology which can be combined with many\nKV compression technologies to improve the model accuracy at a much smaller\nmemory.

However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors\nlose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha\nmining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay\nfrom overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing\nknowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate\ndecay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous\nframework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations\nfor mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key\nmechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on\nabstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor\nalignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and\ngenerated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural\nconstraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to\noverfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process\nto balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving\nmarket conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations\nshow that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in\nmitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering\nsignificant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four\nyears.

      "abstract": "Species interaction networks are a powerful tool for describing ecological\ncommunities; they typically contain nodes representing species, and edges\nrepresenting interactions between those species. For the purposes of drawing\nabstract inferences about groups of similar networks, ecologists often use\ngraph topology metrics to summarize structural features. However, gathering the\ndata that underlies these networks is challenging, which can lead to some\ninteractions being missed. Thus, it is important to understand how much\ndifferent structural metrics are affected by missing data. To address this\nquestion, we analyzed a database of 148 real-world bipartite networks\nrepresenting four different types of species interactions (pollination,\nhost-parasite, plant-ant, and seed-dispersal). For each network, we measured\nsix different topological properties: number of connected components, variance\nin node betweenness, variance in node PageRank, largest Eigenvalue, the number\nof non-zero Eigenvalues, and community detection as determined by four\ndifferent algorithms. We then tested how these properties change as additional\nedges -- representing data that may have been missed -- are added to the\nnetworks. We found substantial variation in how robust different properties\nwere to the missing data. For example, the Clauset-Newman-Moore and Louvain\ncommunity detection algorithms showed much more gradual change as edges were\nadded than the label propagation and Girvan-Newman algorithms did, suggesting\nthat the former are more robust. Robustness also varied for some metrics based\non interaction type. These results provide a foundation for selecting network\nproperties to use when analyzing messy ecological network data.",

While\nsubstantial efforts have been made to evaluate and enhance AI safety, the lack\nof a standardized framework and comprehensive toolkit poses significant\nobstacles to systematic research and practical adoption. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce AISafetyLab, a unified framework and toolkit that integrates\nrepresentative attack, defense, and evaluation methodologies for AI safety.\nAISafetyLab features an intuitive interface that enables developers to\nseamlessly apply various techniques while maintaining a well-structured and\nextensible codebase for future advancements. Additionally, we conduct empirical\nstudies on Vicuna, analyzing different attack and defense strategies to provide\nvaluable insights into their comparative effectiveness.

While model merging offers a\ntraining-free solution to integrate multiple task-specific models, existing\nmethods suffer from safety-utility conflicts where enhanced general\ncapabilities degrade safety safeguards.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LED-Merging}, a three-stage\nframework that \\textbf{L}ocates task-specific neurons via gradient-based\nattribution, dynamically \\textbf{E}lects critical neurons through multi-model\nimportance fusion, and \\textbf{D}isjoints conflicting updates through parameter\nisolation. Extensive experiments on Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-13B\ndemonstrate that LED-Merging reduces harmful response rates(\\emph{e.g.}, a\n31.4\\% decrease on Llama-3-8B-Instruct on HarmBench) while preserving 95\\% of\nutility performance(\\emph{e.g.}, 52.39\\% accuracy on GSM8K).

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have emerged as an effective approach to tackling\nreal-world problems. However, like human-written software, DNNs are susceptible\nto bugs and attacks. This has generated significant interests in developing\neffective and scalable DNN verification techniques and tools. In this paper, we\npresent VeriStable, a novel extension of recently proposed DPLL-based\nconstraint DNN verification approach. VeriStable leverages the insight that\nwhile neuron behavior may be non-linear across the entire DNN input space, at\nintermediate states computed during verification many neurons may be\nconstrained to have linear behavior - these neurons are stable. Efficiently\ndetecting stable neurons reduces combinatorial complexity without compromising\nthe precision of abstractions. Moreover, the structure of clauses arising in\nDNN verification problems shares important characteristics with industrial SAT\nbenchmarks. We adapt and incorporate multi-threading and restart optimizations\ntargeting those characteristics to further optimize DPLL-based DNN\nverification. We evaluate the effectiveness of VeriStable across a range of\nchallenging benchmarks including fully-connected feedforward networks (FNNs),\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and residual networks (ResNets) applied to\nthe standard MNIST and CIFAR datasets. Preliminary results show that VeriStable\nis competitive and outperforms state-of-the-art DNN verification tools,\nincluding $\\alpha$-$\\beta$-CROWN and MN-BaB, the first and second performers of\nthe VNN-COMP, respectively.",

To correspond the reference image and the observed scene,\nwe exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing\nsemantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features,\nwe compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a\nperspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a\nmanipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos\ntaken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by\nusers themselves, as measured by human feedback.

    "abstract": "In a world where Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly deployed to support\ndecision-making in critical domains, providing decision-makers with\nexplainable, stable, and relevant inputs becomes fundamental. Understanding how\nmachine learning works under missing data and how this affects feature\nvariability is paramount. This is even more relevant as machine learning\napproaches focus on standardising decision-making approaches that rely on an\nidealised set of features. However, decision-making in human activities often\nrelies on incomplete data, even in critical domains. This paper addresses this\ngap by conducting a set of experiments using traditional machine learning\nmethods that look for optimal decisions in comparison to a recently deployed\nmachine learning method focused on a classification that is more descriptive\nand mimics human decision making, allowing for the natural integration of\nexplainability. We found that the ML descriptive approach maintains higher\nclassification accuracy while ensuring the stability of feature selection as\ndata incompleteness increases. This suggests that descriptive classification\nmethods can be helpful in uncertain decision-making scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Choosing appropriate hyperparameters plays a crucial role in the success of\nneural networks as hyper-parameters directly control the behavior and\nperformance of the training algorithms. To obtain efficient tuning, Bayesian\noptimization methods based on Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used.\nDespite numerous applications of Bayesian optimization in deep learning, the\nexisting methodologies are developed based on a convenient but restrictive\nassumption that the tuning parameters are independent of each other. However,\ntuning parameters with conditional dependence are common in practice. In this\npaper, we focus on two types of them: branching and nested parameters. Nested\nparameters refer to those tuning parameters that exist only within a particular\nsetting of another tuning parameter, and a parameter within which other\nparameters are nested is called a branching parameter. To capture the\nconditional dependence between branching and nested parameters, a unified\nBayesian optimization framework is proposed. The sufficient conditions are\nrigorously derived to guarantee the validity of the kernel function, and the\nasymptotic convergence of the proposed optimization framework is proven under\nthe continuum-armed-bandit setting. Based on the new GP model, which accounts\nfor the dependent structure among input variables through a new kernel\nfunction, higher prediction accuracy and better optimization efficiency are\nobserved in a series of synthetic simulations and real data applications of\nneural networks. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to provide insights\ninto how changes in hyperparameter values affect prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "WiFi-enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are evolving from mere\ncommunication devices to sensing instruments, leveraging Channel State\nInformation (CSI) extraction capabilities. Nevertheless, resource-constrained\nIoT devices and the intricacies of deep neural networks necessitate\ntransmitting CSI to cloud servers for sensing. Although feasible, this leads to\nconsiderable communication overhead. In this context, this paper develops a\nnovel Real-time Sensing and Compression Network (RSCNet) which enables sensing\nwith compressed CSI; thereby reducing the communication overheads. RSCNet\nfacilitates optimization across CSI windows composed of a few CSI frames. Once\ntransmitted to cloud servers, it employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to\nharness data from prior windows, thus bolstering both the sensing accuracy and\nCSI reconstruction. RSCNet adeptly balances the trade-off between CSI\ncompression and sensing precision, thus streamlining real-time cloud-based WiFi\nsensing with reduced communication costs. Numerical findings demonstrate the\ngains of RSCNet over the existing benchmarks like SenseFi, showcasing a sensing\naccuracy of 97.4% with minimal CSI reconstruction error. Numerical results also\nshow a computational analysis of the proposed RSCNet as a function of the\nnumber of CSI frames.",

Key to this is the ability to accurately animate a\npersonalized photorealistic avatar, and hence the acquisition of the labels for\nheadset-mounted camera (HMC) images need to be efficient and accurate, while\nwearing a VR headset. This is challenging due to oblique camera views and\ndifferences in image modality. In this work, we first show that the domain gap\nbetween the avatar and HMC images is one of the primary sources of difficulty,\nwhere a transformer-based architecture achieves high accuracy on\ndomain-consistent data, but degrades when the domain-gap is re-introduced.\nBuilding on this finding, we propose a system split into two parts: an\niterative refinement module that takes in-domain inputs, and a generic\navatar-guided image-to-image domain transfer module conditioned on current\nestimates. These two modules reinforce each other: domain transfer becomes\neasier when close-to-groundtruth examples are shown, and better domain-gap\nremoval in turn improves the registration. Our system obviates the need for\ncostly offline optimization, and produces online registration of higher quality\nthan direct regression method. We validate the accuracy and efficiency of our\napproach through extensive experiments on a commodity headset, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements over these baselines.

Our approach\nhas two core components: a) learning priors about invisible parts of the human\nbody and clothing, and b) rendering novel body poses with proper clothing and\ntexture. For the first part, we learn an in-filling diffusion model to\nhallucinate unseen parts of a person given a single image. We train this model\non texture map space, which makes it more sample-efficient since it is\ninvariant to pose and viewpoint. Second, we develop a diffusion-based rendering\npipeline, which is controlled by 3D human poses. This produces realistic\nrenderings of novel poses of the person, including clothing, hair, and\nplausible in-filling of unseen regions. This disentangled approach allows our\nmethod to generate a sequence of images that are faithful to the target motion\nin the 3D pose and, to the input image in terms of visual similarity. In\naddition to that, the 3D control allows various synthetic camera trajectories\nto render a person. Our experiments show that our method is resilient in\ngenerating prolonged motions and varied challenging and complex poses compared\nto prior methods.

However, they do not\ngeneralise well to new datasets with different characteristics to those they\nwere trained on, unlike classic feature extractors. Instead, they require\nfinetuning, which assumes that ground-truth correspondences or ground-truth\ncamera poses and 3D structure are available. We relax this assumption by\nremoving the requirement of 3D structure, e.g., depth maps or point clouds, and\nonly require camera pose information, which can be obtained from odometry. We\ndo so by replacing correspondence losses with epipolar losses, which encourage\nputative matches to lie on the associated epipolar line. While weaker than\ncorrespondence supervision, we observe that this cue is sufficient for\nfinetuning existing models on new data.

Collecting and annotating\nreal-world 3D data and corresponding images is laborious, expensive, yet\nunavoidable process, since even 3D pose domain adaptation methods require 3D\ndata in the target domain. We introduce 3DUDA, a method capable of adapting to\na nuisance-ridden target domain without 3D or depth data. Our key insight stems\nfrom the observation that specific object subparts remain stable across\nout-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, enabling strategic utilization of these\ninvariant subcomponents for effective model updates. We represent object\ncategories as simple cuboid meshes, and harness a generative model of neural\nfeature activations modeled at each mesh vertex learnt using differential\nrendering. We focus on individual locally robust mesh vertex features and\niteratively update them based on their proximity to corresponding features in\nthe target domain even when the global pose is not correct. Our model is then\ntrained in an EM fashion, alternating between updating the vertex features and\nthe feature extractor. We show that our method simulates fine-tuning on a\nglobal pseudo-labeled dataset under mild assumptions, which converges to the\ntarget domain asymptotically. Through extensive empirical validation, including\na complex extreme UDA setup which combines real nuisances, synthetic noise, and\nocclusion, we demonstrate the potency of our simple approach in addressing the\ndomain shift challenge and significantly improving pose estimation accuracy.",

A particular challenge relates to the use of coded language by\ngroups interested in both creating a sense of belonging for its users and\nevading detection. Coded language evolves quickly and its use varies over time.\nThis paper proposes a methodology for detecting emerging coded hate-laden\nterminology. The methodology is tested in the context of online antisemitic\ndiscourse. The approach considers posts scraped from social media platforms,\noften used by extremist users. The posts are scraped using seed expressions\nrelated to previously known discourse of hatred towards Jews. The method begins\nby identifying the expressions most representative of each post and calculating\ntheir frequency in the whole corpus. It filters out grammatically incoherent\nexpressions as well as previously encountered ones so as to focus on emergent\nwell-formed terminology. This is followed by an assessment of semantic\nsimilarity to known antisemitic terminology using a fine-tuned large language\nmodel, and subsequent filtering out of the expressions that are too distant\nfrom known expressions of hatred. Emergent antisemitic expressions containing\nterms clearly relating to Jewish topics are then removed to return only coded\nexpressions of hatred.",

Concretely, we seek to explain the\ndecision-making process of video transformers based on high-level,\nspatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on\nconcept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks.\nComparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing\ncomplexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In\nthis work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first\nVideo Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose\nan efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video\ntransformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the\noutput of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing\nspatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in\nunstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set\nof supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of\nthese mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we show that VTCD\ncan be used for fine-grained action recognition and video object segmentation.",

This\nintegration has many promises, such as decreasing the amount of data required\nto train a neural network, improving the explainability and interpretability of\nanswers given by models and verifying the correctness of trained systems. We\nstudy neurosymbolic learning, where we have both data and background knowledge\nexpressed using symbolic languages. How do we connect the symbolic and neural\ncomponents to communicate this knowledge? One option is fuzzy reasoning, which\nstudies degrees of truth. For example, being tall is not a binary concept.\nInstead, probabilistic reasoning studies the probability that something is true\nor will happen. Our first research question studies how different forms of\nfuzzy reasoning combine with learning. We find surprising results like a\nconnection to the Raven paradox stating we confirm \"ravens are black\" when we\nobserve a green apple.

Despite recent\nprogress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots,\nvehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods\nand tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled\nway. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based\ncoordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour\nin terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding\ncollective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm\nof aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm\nbehaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal\nfields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the\nexpressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework\nfor swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common\npatterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making.

    "abstract": "With the breakthrough of multi-modal large language models, answering complex\nvisual questions that demand advanced reasoning abilities and world knowledge\nhas become a much more important testbed for developing AI models than ever.\nHowever, equipping AI models with robust cross-modality reasoning ability\nremains challenging since the cognition scheme of humans has not been\nunderstood systematically. In this paper, we believe that if we can collect\nvisual clues in the given image as much as possible, we will recognize the\nimage more accurately, understand the question better, recall relevant\nknowledge more easily, and finally reason out the answer. We discover these\nrich visual clues by mining question-answer pairs in images and sending them\ninto multi-modal large language models as prompts. We call the proposed method\nQ&A Prompts. Specifically, we first use the image-answer pairs and the\ncorresponding questions in the training set as inputs and outputs to train a\nvisual question generation model. Then, we use an image tagging model to\nidentify various instances and send packaged image-tag pairs into the visual\nquestion generation model to generate relevant questions with the extracted\nimage tags as answers. Finally, we encode these generated question-answer pairs\nas prompts with a visual-aware prompting module and send them into pre-trained\nmulti-modal large language models to reason out the final answers. Experimental\nresults show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our Q&A Prompts\nachieves substantial improvements on the challenging visual question answering\ndatasets requiring reasoning over diverse world knowledge, such as OK-VQA and\nA-OKVQA.",

Despite the recent success of\nLarge Multimodal Models (LMMs) in image-language understanding and reasoning,\nthey deal with VideoQA insufficiently, by simply taking uniformly sampled\nframes as visual inputs, which ignores question-relevant visual clues.\nMoreover, there are no human annotations for question-critical timestamps in\nexisting VideoQA datasets. In light of this, we propose a novel weakly\nsupervised framework to enforce the LMMs to reason out the answers with\nquestion-critical moments as visual inputs.

    "abstract": "Safe offline RL is a promising way to bypass risky online interactions\ntowards safe policy learning. Most existing methods only enforce soft\nconstraints, i.e., constraining safety violations in expectation below\nthresholds predetermined. This can lead to potentially unsafe outcomes, thus\nunacceptable in safety-critical scenarios. An alternative is to enforce the\nhard constraint of zero violation. However, this can be challenging in offline\nsetting, as it needs to strike the right balance among three highly intricate\nand correlated aspects: safety constraint satisfaction, reward maximization,\nand behavior regularization imposed by offline datasets. Interestingly, we\ndiscover that via reachability analysis of safe-control theory, the hard safety\nconstraint can be equivalently translated to identifying the largest feasible\nregion given the offline dataset. This seamlessly converts the original trilogy\nproblem to a feasibility-dependent objective, i.e., maximizing reward value\nwithin the feasible region while minimizing safety risks in the infeasible\nregion. Inspired by these, we propose FISOR (FeasIbility-guided Safe Offline\nRL), which allows safety constraint adherence, reward maximization, and offline\npolicy learning to be realized via three decoupled processes, while offering\nstrong safety performance and stability. In FISOR, the optimal policy for the\ntranslated optimization problem can be derived in a special form of weighted\nbehavior cloning. Thus, we propose a novel energy-guided diffusion model that\ndoes not require training a complicated time-dependent classifier to extract\nthe policy, greatly simplifying the training. We compare FISOR against\nbaselines on DSRL benchmark for safe offline RL. Evaluation results show that\nFISOR is the only method that can guarantee safety satisfaction in all tasks,\nwhile achieving top returns in most tasks.",

In many complete solvers, once a better solution is\nfound, a Soft conflict Pseudo Boolean (SPB) constraint will be generated to\nenforce the algorithm to find better solutions. In many local search\nalgorithms, clause weighting is a key technique for effectively guiding the\nsearch directions. In this paper, we propose to transfer the SPB constraint\ninto the clause weighting system of the local search method, leading the\nalgorithm to better solutions. We further propose an adaptive clause weighting\nstrategy that breaks the tradition of using constant values to adjust clause\nweights. Based on the above methods, we propose a new local search algorithm\ncalled SPB-MaxSAT that provides new perspectives for clause weighting on MaxSAT\nlocal search solvers.

This paper introduces\nSocraSynth, a multi-LLM agent reasoning platform developed to mitigate these\nissues. SocraSynth utilizes conditional statistics and systematic context\nenhancement through continuous arguments, alongside adjustable debate\ncontentiousness levels. The platform typically involves a human moderator and\ntwo LLM agents representing opposing viewpoints on a given subject. SocraSynth\noperates in two main phases: knowledge generation and reasoning evaluation. In\nthe knowledge generation phase, the moderator defines the debate topic and\ncontentiousness level, prompting the agents to formulate supporting arguments\nfor their respective stances. The reasoning evaluation phase then employs\nSocratic reasoning and formal logic principles to appraise the quality of the\narguments presented. The dialogue concludes with the moderator adjusting the\ncontentiousness from confrontational to collaborative, gathering final,\nconciliatory remarks to aid in human reasoning and decision-making. Through\ncase studies in three distinct application domains, this paper showcases\nSocraSynth's effectiveness in fostering rigorous research, dynamic reasoning,\ncomprehensive assessment, and enhanced collaboration.

Despite these advancements, DRL is\nstill identified as data-inefficient as effective policies demand vast numbers\nof environmental samples. Recently, episodic control (EC)-based model-free DRL\nmethods enable sample efficiency by recalling past experiences from episodic\nmemory. However, existing EC-based methods suffer from the limitation of\npotential misalignment between the state and reward spaces for neglecting the\nutilization of (past) retrieval states with extensive information, which\nprobably causes inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. To\ntackle this issue, we introduce an efficient EC-based DRL framework with\nexpanded state-reward space, where the expanded states used as the input and\nthe expanded rewards used in the training both contain historical and current\ninformation. To be specific, we reuse the historical states retrieved by EC as\npart of the input states and integrate the retrieved MC-returns into the\nimmediate reward in each interactive transition. As a result, our method is\nable to simultaneously achieve the full utilization of retrieval information\nand the better evaluation of state values by a Temporal Difference (TD) loss.\nEmpirical results on challenging Box2d and Mujoco tasks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over a recent sibling method and common baselines.\nFurther, we also verify our method's effectiveness in alleviating Q-value\noverestimation by additional experiments of Q-value comparison.",

    "abstract": "Self-consistency (SC) has been a widely used decoding strategy for\nchain-of-thought reasoning. Despite bringing significant performance\nimprovements across a variety of multi-step reasoning tasks, it is a high-cost\nmethod that requires multiple sampling with the preset size. In this paper, we\npropose a simple and scalable sampling process, \\textbf{E}arly-Stopping\n\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsistency (ESC), to greatly reduce the cost of SC\nwithout sacrificing performance. On this basis, one control scheme for ESC is\nfurther derivated to dynamically choose the performance-cost balance for\ndifferent tasks and models. To demonstrate ESC's effectiveness, we conducted\nextensive experiments on three popular categories of reasoning tasks:\narithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning over language models with\nvarying scales. The empirical results show that ESC reduces the average number\nof sampling of chain-of-thought reasoning by a significant margin on six\nbenchmarks, including MATH (-33.8%), GSM8K (-80.1%), StrategyQA (-76.8%),\nCommonsenseQA (-78.5%), Coin Flip (-84.2%) and Last Letters (-67.4%), while\nattaining comparable performances.",

    "abstract": "Representations learned via self-supervised learning (SSL) can be susceptible\nto dimensional collapse, where the learned representation subspace is of\nextremely low dimensionality and thus fails to represent the full data\ndistribution and modalities. Dimensional collapse also known as the\n\"underfilling\" phenomenon is one of the major causes of degraded performance on\ndownstream tasks. Previous work has investigated the dimensional collapse\nproblem of SSL at a global level. In this paper, we demonstrate that\nrepresentations can span over high dimensional space globally, but collapse\nlocally. To address this, we propose a method called $\\textit{local\ndimensionality regularization (LDReg)}$. Our formulation is based on the\nderivation of the Fisher-Rao metric to compare and optimize local distance\ndistributions at an asymptotically small radius for each data point. By\nincreasing the local intrinsic dimensionality, we demonstrate through a range\nof experiments that LDReg improves the representation quality of SSL. The\nresults also show that LDReg can regularize dimensionality at both local and\nglobal levels.",

We\npropose a new KE framework: DEEPEDIT (Depth-first Search-based Constrained\nDecoding for Knowledge Editing), which enhances LLMs's ability to generate\ncoherent reasoning chains with new knowledge through depth-first search. Our\nsearch selects the most important knowledge that satisfies our constraints as\nthe reasoning step to efficiently increase the reasoning depth. In addition to\nDEEPEDIT, we propose two new KE benchmarks: MQUAKE-2002 and MQUAKE-HARD, which\nprovide more precise and challenging assessments of KE approaches.\nQualitatively, DEEPEDIT enables LLMs to produce succinct and coherent reasoning\nchains involving new knowledge.

Prior work has\nshown the existence of MILP backdoors, small sets of variables such that\nprioritizing branching on them when possible leads to faster running times.\nHowever, finding high-quality backdoors that improve running times remains an\nopen question. Previous work learns to estimate the relative solver speed of\nrandomly sampled backdoors through ranking and then decide whether to use the\nhighest-ranked backdoor candidate. In this paper, we utilize the Monte-Carlo\ntree search method to collect backdoors for training, rather than relying on\nrandom sampling, and adapt a contrastive learning framework to train a Graph\nAttention Network model to predict backdoors.

To further characterize the stability of LoRA-based\nsecond-pass speech recognition models, we examine robustness against input\nperturbations. These perturbations are rooted in homophone replacements and a\nnovel metric called N-best Perturbation-based Rescoring Robustness (NPRR), both\ndesigned to measure the relative degradation in the performance of rescoring\nmodels. Our experimental results indicate that while advanced variants of LoRA,\nsuch as dynamic rank-allocated LoRA, lead to performance degradation in\n$1$-best perturbation, they alleviate the degradation in $N$-best perturbation.\nThis finding is in comparison to fully-tuned models and vanilla LoRA tuning\nbaselines, suggesting that a comprehensive selection is needed when using\nLoRA-based adaptation for compute-cost savings and robust language modeling.",

The latest work proposes a GER benchmark with HyPoradise\ndataset to learn the mapping from ASR N-best hypotheses to ground-truth\ntranscription by efficient LLM finetuning, which shows great effectiveness but\nlacks specificity on noise-robust ASR. In this work, we extend the benchmark to\nnoisy conditions and investigate if we can teach LLMs to perform denoising for\nGER just like what robust ASR do}, where one solution is introducing noise\ninformation as a conditioner into LLM. However, directly incorporating noise\nembeddings from audio encoder could harm the LLM tuning due to cross-modality\ngap. To this end, we propose to extract a language-space noise embedding from\nthe N-best list to represent the noise conditions of source speech, which can\npromote the denoising process in GER. Furthermore, in order to enhance its\nrepresentation ability of audio noise, we design a knowledge distillation (KD)\napproach via mutual information estimation to distill the real noise\ninformation in audio embeddings to our language embedding. Experiments on\nvarious latest LLMs demonstrate our approach achieves a new breakthrough with\nup to 53.9% correction improvement in terms of word error rate while with\nlimited training data. Analysis shows that our language-space noise embedding\ncan well represent the noise conditions of source speech, under which\noff-the-shelf LLMs show strong ability of language-space denoising.",

This concept is\nunderpinned by both informational and physical principles, rooted in the\ninherent properties of these invariants. Firstly, their stability makes them\nideal for memorization and integration into associative networks, forming the\nbasis of our knowledge structures. Secondly, the predictability of these stable\ninvariants makes them valuable sources of usable energy, quantifiable as kTln2\nper bit of accurately predicted information. This energy can be harnessed to\nexplore new transformations, rendering learning systems energetically\nautonomous and increasingly effective. Such systems are driven to continuously\nseek new data invariants as energy sources.

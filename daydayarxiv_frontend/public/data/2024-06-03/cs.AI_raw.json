    "abstract": "In contemporary radiotherapy planning (RTP), a key module leaf sequencing is\npredominantly addressed by optimization-based approaches. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model termed as Reinforced\nLeaf Sequencer (RLS) in a multi-agent framework for leaf sequencing. The RLS\nmodel offers improvements to time-consuming iterative optimization steps via\nlarge-scale training and can control movement patterns through the design of\nreward mechanisms. We have conducted experiments on four datasets with four\nmetrics and compared our model with a leading optimization sequencer. Our\nfindings reveal that the proposed RLS model can achieve reduced fluence\nreconstruction errors, and potential faster convergence when integrated in an\noptimization planner. Additionally, RLS has shown promising results in a full\nartificial intelligence RTP pipeline. We hope this pioneer multi-agent RL leaf\nsequencer can foster future research on machine learning for RTP.",

    "abstract": "In multivariate time series (MTS) classification, finding the important\nfeatures (e.g., sensors) for model performance is crucial yet challenging due\nto the complex, high-dimensional nature of MTS data, intricate temporal\ndynamics, and the necessity for domain-specific interpretations. Current\nexplanation methods for MTS mostly focus on time-centric explanations, apt for\npinpointing important time periods but less effective in identifying key\nfeatures. This limitation underscores the pressing need for a feature-centric\napproach, a vital yet often overlooked perspective that complements\ntime-centric analysis. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel\nfeature-centric explanation and evaluation framework for MTS, named CAFO\n(Channel Attention and Feature Orthgonalization). CAFO employs a\nconvolution-based approach with channel attention mechanisms, incorporating a\ndepth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) and a QR\ndecomposition-based loss for promoting feature-wise orthogonality. We\ndemonstrate that this orthogonalization enhances the separability of attention\ndistributions, thereby refining and stabilizing the ranking of feature\nimportance. This improvement in feature-wise ranking enhances our understanding\nof feature explainability in MTS. Furthermore, we develop metrics to evaluate\nglobal and class-specific feature importance. Our framework's efficacy is\nvalidated through extensive empirical analyses on two major public benchmarks\nand real-world datasets, both synthetic and self-collected, specifically\ndesigned to highlight class-wise discriminative features. The results confirm\nCAFO's robustness and informative capacity in assessing feature importance in\nMTS classification tasks. This study not only advances the understanding of\nfeature-centric explanations in MTS but also sets a foundation for future\nexplorations in feature-centric explanations.",

Specifically, we show how the usually neglected data-dependent component\nin the NTK's spectrum can be taken into account by providing an analytical\nupper bound to the NTK's trace obtained by decomposing neural networks into\nindividual paths.

    "abstract": "Silicon microring resonators (MRRs) have shown strong potential in acting as\nthe nonlinear nodes of photonic reservoir computing (RC) schemes. By using\nnonlinearities within a silicon MRR, such as the ones caused by free-carrier\ndispersion (FCD) and thermo-optic (TO) effects, it is possible to map the input\ndata of the RC to a higher dimensional space. Furthermore, by adding an\nexternal waveguide between the through and add ports of the MRR, it is possible\nto implement a time-delay RC (TDRC) with enhanced memory. The input from the\nthrough port is fed back into the add port of the ring with the delay applied\nby the external waveguide effectively adding memory. In a TDRC, the nodes are\nmultiplexed in time, and their respective time evolutions are detected at the\ndrop port. The performance of MRR-based TDRC is highly dependent on the amount\nof nonlinearity in the MRR. The nonlinear effects, in turn, are dependent on\nthe physical properties of the MRR as they determine the lifetime of the\neffects. Another factor to take into account is the stability of the MRR\nresponse, as strong time-domain discontinuities at the drop port are known to\nemerge from FCD nonlinearities due to self-pulsing (high nonlinear behaviour).\nHowever, quantifying the right amount of nonlinearity that RC needs for a\ncertain task in order to achieve optimum performance is challenging. Therefore,\nfurther analysis is required to fully understand the nonlinear dynamics of this\nTDRC setup. Here, we quantify the nonlinear and linear memory capacity of the\npreviously described microring-based TDRC scheme, as a function of the time\nconstants of the generated carriers and the thermal of the TO effects. We\nanalyze the properties of the TDRC dynamics that generate the parameter space,\nin terms of input signal power and frequency detuning range, over which\nconventional RC tasks can be satisfactorily performed by the TDRC scheme.",

For LLMs to be\napplied reliably, it is essential to have an accurate measure of their\nconfidence. Currently, the most commonly used confidence score function is the\nlikelihood of the generated sequence, which, however, conflates semantic and\nsyntactic components. For instance, in question-answering (QA) tasks, an\nawkward phrasing of the correct answer might result in a lower probability\nprediction. Additionally, different tokens should be weighted differently\ndepending on the context. In this work, we propose enhancing the predicted\nsequence probability by assigning different weights to various tokens using\nattention values elicited from the base LLM. By employing a validation set, we\ncan identify the relevant attention heads, thereby significantly improving the\nreliability of the vanilla sequence probability confidence measure. We refer to\nthis new score as the Contextualized Sequence Likelihood (CSL). CSL is easy to\nimplement, fast to compute, and offers considerable potential for further\nimprovement with task-specific prompts.

Due to the causal\nattention mechanism, these intermediate predictions only depend on the tokens\nseen before the inference point, allowing us to obtain the model's prediction\non a masked input sub-sequence, with negligible computational overheads.

    "abstract": "Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer a reward from expert\ndemonstrations, motivated by the idea that the reward, rather than the policy,\nis the most succinct and transferable description of a task [Ng et al., 2000].\nHowever, the reward corresponding to an optimal policy is not unique, making it\nunclear if an IRL-learned reward is transferable to new transition laws in the\nsense that its optimal policy aligns with the optimal policy corresponding to\nthe expert's true reward. Past work has addressed this problem only under the\nassumption of full access to the expert's policy, guaranteeing transferability\nwhen learning from two experts with the same reward but different transition\nlaws that satisfy a specific rank condition [Rolland et al., 2022]. In this\nwork, we show that the conditions developed under full access to the expert's\npolicy cannot guarantee transferability in the more practical scenario where we\nhave access only to demonstrations of the expert. Instead of a binary rank\ncondition, we propose principal angles as a more refined measure of similarity\nand dissimilarity between transition laws. Based on this, we then establish two\nkey results: 1) a sufficient condition for transferability to any transition\nlaws when learning from at least two experts with sufficiently different\ntransition laws, and 2) a sufficient condition for transferability to local\nchanges in the transition law when learning from a single expert. Furthermore,\nwe also provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm and an\nend-to-end analysis for learning transferable rewards from demonstrations of\nmultiple experts.",

    "abstract": "Actor-critic (AC) is a powerful method for learning an optimal policy in\nreinforcement learning, where the critic uses algorithms, e.g., temporal\ndifference (TD) learning with function approximation, to evaluate the current\npolicy and the actor updates the policy along an approximate gradient direction\nusing information from the critic. This paper provides the \\textit{tightest}\nnon-asymptotic convergence bounds for both the AC and natural AC (NAC)\nalgorithms. Specifically, existing studies show that AC converges to an\n$\\epsilon+\\varepsilon_{\\text{critic}}$ neighborhood of stationary points with\nthe best known sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ (up to a log\nfactor), and NAC converges to an\n$\\epsilon+\\varepsilon_{\\text{critic}}+\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{\\text{actor}}}$\nneighborhood of the global optimum with the best known sample complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$, where $\\varepsilon_{\\text{critic}}$ is the\napproximation error of the critic and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{actor}}$ is the\napproximation error induced by the insufficient expressive power of the\nparameterized policy class. This paper analyzes the convergence of both AC and\nNAC algorithms with compatible function approximation. Our analysis eliminates\nthe term $\\varepsilon_{\\text{critic}}$ from the error bounds while still\nachieving the best known sample complexities. Moreover, we focus on the\nchallenging single-loop setting with a single Markovian sample trajectory. Our\nmajor technical novelty lies in analyzing the stochastic bias due to\npolicy-dependent and time-varying compatible function approximation in the\ncritic, and handling the non-ergodicity of the MDP due to the single Markovian\nsample trajectory.

These models are essential\nto Knowledge Graph Completion yet criticized for their opaque, black-box\nnature. Despite their significant success in capturing the semantics of\nknowledge graphs through high-dimensional latent representations, their\ninherent complexity poses substantial challenges to explainability. While\nexisting methods like Kelpie use resource-intensive perturbation to explain KGE\nmodels, our approach directly decodes the latent representations encoded by KGE\nmodels, leveraging the smoothness of the embeddings, which follows the\nprinciple that similar embeddings reflect similar behaviours within the\nKnowledge Graph, meaning that nodes are similarly embedded because their graph\nneighbourhood looks similar. This principle is commonly referred to as\nsmoothness. By identifying symbolic structures, in the form of triples, within\nthe subgraph neighborhoods of similarly embedded entities, our method\nidentifies the statistical regularities on which the models rely and translates\nthese insights into human-understandable symbolic rules and facts. This bridges\nthe gap between the abstract representations of KGE models and their predictive\noutputs, offering clear, interpretable insights. Key contributions include a\nnovel post-hoc and local explainable AI method for KGE models that provides\nimmediate, faithful explanations without retraining, facilitating real-time\napplication on large-scale knowledge graphs. The method's flexibility enables\nthe generation of rule-based, instance-based, and analogy-based explanations,\nmeeting diverse user needs.

A key design choice is given by the sparse\ninitialization, which determines the trainable sub-network through a binary\nmask. Existing methods mainly select such mask based on a predefined dense\ninitialization. Such an approach may not efficiently leverage the mask's\npotential impact on the optimization. An alternative direction, inspired by\nresearch into dynamical isometry, is to introduce orthogonality in the sparse\nsubnetwork, which helps in stabilizing the gradient signal. In this work, we\npropose Exact Orthogonal Initialization (EOI), a novel sparse orthogonal\ninitialization scheme based on composing random Givens rotations. Contrary to\nother existing approaches, our method provides exact (not approximated)\northogonality and enables the creation of layers with arbitrary densities. We\ndemonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of EOI through\nexperiments, consistently outperforming common sparse initialization\ntechniques. Our method enables training highly sparse 1000-layer MLP and CNN\nnetworks without residual connections or normalization techniques, emphasizing\nthe crucial role of weight initialization in static sparse training alongside\nsparse mask selection.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new dataset and benchmark, InteractADL, for\nunderstanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and\nobjects). Furthermore, complex ADLs occurring in home environments comprise a\nchallenging long-tailed distribution due to the rarity of multi-person\ninteractions, and pose fine-grained visual recognition tasks due to the\npresence of semantically and visually similar classes. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel method for fine-grained few-shot video classification called\nName Tuning that enables greater semantic separability by learning optimal\nclass name vectors. We show that Name Tuning can be combined with existing\nprompt tuning strategies to learn the entire input text (rather than only\nlearning the prompt or class names) and demonstrate improved performance for\nfew-shot classification on InteractADL and 4 other fine-grained visual\nclassification benchmarks. For transparency and reproducibility, we release our\ncode at https://github.com/zanedurante/vlm_benchmark.",

To model this process, we design a\nconsistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly\ninstead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast\nconvergence in the low-dimensional action manifold.

    "abstract": "Online and offline RLHF methods, such as PPO and DPO, have been highly\nsuccessful in aligning AI with human preferences. Despite their success,\nhowever, these methods suffer from fundamental limitations: (a) Models trained\nwith RLHF can learn from mistakes or negative examples through RL mechanism or\ncontrastive loss during training. However, at inference time, they lack an\ninnate self-improvement mechanism for error corrections. (b) The optimal\nsolution of existing methods is highly task-dependent, making it difficult for\nthem to generalize to new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nSelf-Improving Robust Preference Optimization (SRPO), a practical and\nmathematically principled offline RLHF framework. The key idea behind SRPO is\nto cast the problem of learning from human preferences as a self-improvement\nprocess, mathematically formulated as a min-max objective that jointly\noptimizes a self-improvement policy and a generative policy in an adversarial\nfashion. Crucially, the solution for this optimization problem is independent\nof the training task, which makes it robust to its changes. We then show that\nthis objective can be reformulated as a non-adversarial offline loss, which can\nbe efficiently optimized using standard supervised learning techniques at\nscale. To demonstrate SRPO's effectiveness, we evaluate it using AI Win-Rate\n(WR) against human (GOLD) completions. When tested on the XSum dataset, SRPO\noutperforms DPO by a margin of 15% after 5 self revisions, achieving an\nimpressive 90% WR. Moreover, on the challenging Arena-Hard prompts, SRPO\noutperforms both DPO and IPO (by 4% without revision and 6% after a single\nrevision), reaching a 56% WR against against Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.",

However,\ntraditional Imitation Learning methodologies encounter challenges associated\nwith the co-variate shift phenomenon.

    "abstract": "Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has\nbeen a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain. One\napproach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model\npredicts neural signals, also called \"brain score\". Internal representations\nfrom LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that\nthey share computational principles with human language processing. This\ninference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs\nreflects core elements of language processing. Here, we question this\nassumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on\nLLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where\nparticipants read short passages. We first find that when using shuffled\ntrain-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial\nfeature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but\nalso accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain. We\ntherefore use contiguous splits moving forward. Second, we explain the\nsurprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account\nfor additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and\nsentence position. This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer\narchitecture biases computations to be more brain-like. Third, we find that\nbrain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by\nsentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a\nsmall, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and\ncontextual representations of sentence structure. We conclude that\nover-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity\nbetween LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what\nLLMs are mapping to in neural signals.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval augmented generation has revolutionized large language model (LLM)\noutputs by providing factual supports. Nevertheless, it struggles to capture\nall the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval\nmethods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in\nisolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages\nthat are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, it is crucial to\nrecognize such relatedness for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph\nneural networks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by exploiting the relatedness\nbetween passages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by\nconnecting passages that are structure-related or keyword-related. A graph\nneural network (GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between\npassages and improve the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we\nextend our method to handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent\ngraph neural network (RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates\nthe graphs of passages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of\nsupporting passages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat GNN-Ret achieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single\nquery of LLMs than strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret\nfurther improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to\n10.4% accuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.",

The two most common families of\ntechniques -- online reinforcement learning (RL) such as Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) and offline contrastive methods such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) -- were positioned as equivalent in prior work due to the\nfact that both have to start from the same offline preference dataset. To\nfurther expand our theoretical understanding of the similarities and\ndifferences between online and offline techniques for preference fine-tuning,\nwe conduct a rigorous analysis through the lens of dataset coverage, a concept\nthat captures how the training data covers the test distribution and is widely\nused in RL. We prove that a global coverage condition is both necessary and\nsufficient for offline contrastive methods to converge to the optimal policy,\nbut a weaker partial coverage condition suffices for online RL methods. This\nseparation provides one explanation of why online RL methods can perform better\nthan offline methods, especially when the offline preference data is not\ndiverse enough. Finally, motivated by our preceding theoretical observations,\nwe derive a hybrid preference optimization (HyPO) algorithm that uses offline\ndata for contrastive-based preference optimization and online data for KL\nregularization. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that HyPO is more\nperformant than its pure offline counterpart DPO, while still preserving its\ncomputation and memory efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In Artificial Intelligence, there is an increasing demand for adaptive models\ncapable of dealing with a diverse spectrum of learning tasks, surpassing the\nlimitations of systems devised to cope with a single task. The recent emergence\nof General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) poses model\nconfiguration and adaptability challenges at far greater complexity scales than\nthe optimal design of traditional Machine Learning models. Evolutionary\nComputation (EC) has been a useful tool for both the design and optimization of\nMachine Learning models, endowing them with the capability to configure and/or\nadapt themselves to the task under consideration. Therefore, their application\nto GPAIS is a natural choice. This paper aims to analyze the role of EC in the\nfield of GPAIS, exploring the use of EC for their design or enrichment. We also\nmatch GPAIS properties to Machine Learning areas in which EC has had a notable\ncontribution, highlighting recent milestones of EC for GPAIS. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the challenges of harnessing the benefits of EC for GPAIS, presenting\ndifferent strategies to both design and improve GPAIS with EC, covering\ntangential areas, identifying research niches, and outlining potential research\ndirections for EC and GPAIS.",

    "abstract": "Plant classification is vital for ecological conservation and agricultural\nproductivity, enhancing our understanding of plant growth dynamics and aiding\nspecies preservation. The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has\nrevolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction,\nsignificantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However,\nconventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to\ncapture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent\nresearch has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by\nintegrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant\ncharacteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal\npoint for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal\nDL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion.\nUtilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates\nimages from multiple plant organs -- flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems -- into\na cohesive model. To address the lack of multimodal datasets, we contributed\nMultimodal-PlantCLEF, a restructured version of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset\ntailored for multimodal tasks. Our method achieves 82.61% accuracy on 979\nclasses of Multimodal-PlantCLEF, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and\noutperforming late fusion by 10.33%. Through the incorporation of multimodal\ndropout, our approach demonstrates strong robustness to missing modalities.

The\nreliance on DNNs suggests an improvement that is gradient based, which is per\nstep much less greedy than the improvement possible by greedier operators such\nas the greedy update used by Q-learning algorithms. On the other hand, slow and\nsteady changes to the policy can also be beneficial for the stability of the\nlearning process, resulting in a tradeoff between greedification and stability.\nTo address this tradeoff, we propose to extend the standard framework of actor\ncritic algorithms with value-improvement: a second greedification operator\napplied only when updating the policy's value estimate. In this framework the\nagent can evaluate non-parameterized policies and perform much greedier updates\nwhile maintaining the steady gradient-based improvement to the parameterized\nacting policy. We prove that this approach converges in the popular analysis\nscheme of Generalized Policy Iteration in the finite-horizon domain.\nEmpirically, incorporating value-improvement into the popular off-policy\nactor-critic algorithms TD3 and SAC significantly improves or matches\nperformance over their respective baselines, across different environments from\nthe DeepMind continuous control domain, with negligible compute and\nimplementation cost.",

When deployed on neuromorphic chips, DSNNs offer\nsignificant power advantages over Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANNs) and\neliminate time and energy consuming multiplications due to the binary nature of\nspikes (0 or 1). Additionally, DSNNs excel in processing temporal information,\nmaking them potentially superior for handling temporal data compared to DANNs.\nHowever, their deep network structure and numerous parameters result in high\ncomputational costs and energy consumption, limiting real-life deployment.

Such decision\nproblems can be modeled as Latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), where a\nlatent variable is selected at the beginning of an interaction and is not\ndisclosed to the agent. In the last decade, there has been significant progress\nin solving LMDPs under different structural assumptions. However, for general\nLMDPs, there is no known learning algorithm that provably matches the existing\nlower bound (Kwon et al., 2021).

Our result\nbuilds off a new perspective on the role of off-policy evaluation guarantees\nand coverage coefficients in LMDPs, a perspective, that has been overlooked in\nthe context of exploration in partially observed environments. Specifically, we\nestablish a novel off-policy evaluation lemma and introduce a new coverage\ncoefficient for LMDPs.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative AI have introduced novel prospects and\npractical implementations. Especially diffusion models show their strength in\ngenerating diverse and, at the same time, realistic features, positioning them\nwell for generating counterfactual explanations for computer vision models.\nAnswering \"what if\" questions of what needs to change to make an image\nclassifier change its prediction, counterfactual explanations align well with\nhuman understanding and consequently help in making model behavior more\ncomprehensible. Current methods succeed in generating authentic\ncounterfactuals, but lack transparency as feature changes are not directly\nperceivable. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-guided Latent\nDiffusion Counterfactual Explanations (CoLa-DCE). CoLa-DCE generates\nconcept-guided counterfactuals for any classifier with a high degree of control\nregarding concept selection and spatial conditioning. The counterfactuals\ncomprise an increased granularity through minimal feature changes. The\nreference feature visualization ensures better comprehensibility, while the\nfeature localization provides increased transparency of \"where\" changed \"what\".\nWe demonstrate the advantages of our approach in minimality and\ncomprehensibility across multiple image classification models and datasets and\nprovide insights into how our CoLa-DCE explanations help comprehend model\nerrors like misclassification cases.",

    "abstract": "Consciousness is notoriously hard to define with objective terms. An\nobjective definition of consciousness is critically needed so that we might\naccurately understand how consciousness and resultant choice behaviour may\narise in biological or artificial systems. Many theories have integrated\nneurobiological and psychological research to explain how consciousness might\narise, but few, if any, outline what is fundamentally required to generate\nconsciousness. To identify such requirements, I examine current theories of\nconsciousness and corresponding scientific research to generate a new\ndefinition of consciousness from first principles. Critically, consciousness is\nthe apparatus that provides the ability to make decisions, but it is not\ndefined by the decision itself. As such, a definition of consciousness does not\nrequire choice behaviour or an explicit awareness of temporality despite both\nbeing well-characterised outcomes of conscious thought. Rather, requirements\nfor consciousness include: at least some capability for perception, a memory\nfor the storage of such perceptual information which in turn provides a\nframework for an imagination with which a sense of self can be capable of\nmaking decisions based on possible and desired futures. Thought experiments and\nobservable neurological phenomena demonstrate that these components are\nfundamentally required of consciousness, whereby the loss of any one component\nremoves the capability for conscious thought. Identifying these requirements\nprovides a new definition for consciousness by which we can objectively\ndetermine consciousness in any conceivable agent, such as non-human animals and\nartificially intelligent systems.",

Nevertheless, is it possible to use few-shot\ndemonstrations to efficiently jailbreak LLMs within limited context sizes?\nWhile the vanilla few-shot jailbreaking may be inefficient, we propose improved\ntechniques such as injecting special system tokens like [/INST] and employing\ndemo-level random search from a collected demo pool. These simple techniques\nresult in surprisingly effective jailbreaking against aligned LLMs (even with\nadvanced defenses).

Our study explores this\ndichotomy, examining whether LLMs contribute to or can alleviate popularity\nbias in recommender systems.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP\ntasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as\nBERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that\ninteracts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification\nperformance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two\nstrategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less\nimportant tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass\nthrough the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty\nand alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced\ndistribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand,\ncondenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the\nmodel. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's\nperformance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various\ndatasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models,\nespecially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving\n+5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced\nto 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.",

Prior approaches either perform label projection on\ntranslated source language data or employ a source model to assign pseudo\nlabels for target language data and train a target model on these\npseudo-labeled data to generalize to the target language. However, these\nautomatic labeling procedures inevitably introduce noisy labels, thus leading\nto a performance drop. In this paper, we propose a Global-Local Denoising\nframework (GLoDe) for cross-lingual NER. Specifically, GLoDe introduces a\nprogressive denoising strategy to rectify incorrect pseudo labels by leveraging\nboth global and local distribution information in the semantic space. The\nrefined pseudo-labeled target language data significantly improves the model's\ngeneralization ability. Moreover, previous methods only consider improving the\nmodel with language-agnostic features, however, we argue that target\nlanguage-specific features are also important and should never be ignored. To\nthis end, we employ a simple auxiliary task to achieve this goal. Experimental\nresults on two benchmark datasets with six target languages demonstrate that\nour proposed GLoDe significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.",

In this study, we present an innovative and\neffective model for how institutions can use artificial intelligence to enable\ngroups of people to generate effective solutions to urgent problems more\nefficiently. We describe a proven collective intelligence method, called\nSmarter Crowdsourcing, which is designed to channel the collective intelligence\nof those with expertise about a problem into actionable solutions through\ncrowdsourcing. Then we introduce Policy Synth, an innovative toolkit which\nleverages AI to make the Smarter Crowdsourcing problem-solving approach both\nmore scalable, more effective and more efficient. Policy Synth is crafted using\na human-centric approach, recognizing that AI is a tool to enhance human\nintelligence and creativity, not replace it. Based on a real-world case study\ncomparing the results of expert crowdsourcing alone with expert sourcing\nsupported by Policy Synth AI agents, we conclude that Smarter Crowdsourcing\nwith Policy Synth presents an effective model for integrating the collective\nwisdom of human experts and the computational power of AI to enhance and scale\nup public problem-solving processes. While many existing approaches view AI as\na tool to make crowdsourcing and deliberative processes better and more\nefficient, Policy Synth goes a step further, recognizing that AI can also be\nused to synthesize the findings from engagements together with research to\ndevelop evidence-based solutions and policies.

    "abstract": "Mixed linear regression is a well-studied problem in parametric statistics\nand machine learning. Given a set of samples, tuples of covariates and labels,\nthe task of mixed linear regression is to find a small list of linear\nrelationships that best fit the samples. Usually it is assumed that the label\nis generated stochastically by randomly selecting one of two or more linear\nfunctions, applying this chosen function to the covariates, and potentially\nintroducing noise to the result. In that situation, the objective is to\nestimate the ground-truth linear functions up to some parameter error. The\npopular expectation maximization (EM) and alternating minimization (AM)\nalgorithms have been previously analyzed for this.\n  In this paper, we consider the more general problem of agnostic learning of\nmixed linear regression from samples, without such generative models. In\nparticular, we show that the AM and EM algorithms, under standard conditions of\nseparability and good initialization, lead to agnostic learning in mixed linear\nregression by converging to the population loss minimizers, for suitably\ndefined loss functions. In some sense, this shows the strength of AM and EM\nalgorithms that converges to ``optimal solutions'' even in the absence of\nrealizable generative models.",

In this work, we investigate the evaluation of the\nmetrics themselves, which currently rely on measuring the correlation to human\njudgments or computing sign accuracy scores.\n  These measures only assess how well the metric agrees with the human ratings.\nHowever, our research shows that this does not tell the whole story.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have performed remarkably well in various\nnatural language processing tasks by benchmarking, including in the Western\nmedical domain. However, the professional evaluation benchmarks for LLMs have\nyet to be covered in the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) domain, which has a\nprofound history and vast influence. To address this research gap, we introduce\nTCM-Bench, an comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in TCM. It\ncomprises the TCM-ED dataset, consisting of 5,473 questions sourced from the\nTCM Licensing Exam (TCMLE), including 1,300 questions with authoritative\nanalysis. It covers the core components of TCMLE, including TCM basis and\nclinical practice. To evaluate LLMs beyond accuracy of question answering, we\npropose TCMScore, a metric tailored for evaluating the quality of answers\ngenerated by LLMs for TCM related questions. It comprehensively considers the\nconsistency of TCM semantics and knowledge. After conducting comprehensive\nexperimental analyses from diverse perspectives, we can obtain the following\nfindings: (1) The unsatisfactory performance of LLMs on this benchmark\nunderscores their significant room for improvement in TCM. (2) Introducing\ndomain knowledge can enhance LLMs' performance. However, for in-domain models\nlike ZhongJing-TCM, the quality of generated analysis text has decreased, and\nwe hypothesize that their fine-tuning process affects the basic LLM\ncapabilities. (3) Traditional metrics for text generation quality like Rouge\nand BertScore are susceptible to text length and surface semantic ambiguity,\nwhile domain-specific metrics such as TCMScore can further supplement and\nexplain their evaluation results. These findings highlight the capabilities and\nlimitations of LLMs in the TCM and aim to provide a more profound assistance to\nmedical research.",

Indeed, non-IID data distributions cause client drift\nand biased local solutions, particularly pronounced in the final classification\nlayer, negatively impacting convergence speed and accuracy. To address this\nissue, we introduce Federated Recursive Ridge Regression (Fed3R). Our method\nfits a Ridge Regression classifier computed in closed form leveraging\npre-trained features. Fed3R is immune to statistical heterogeneity and is\ninvariant to the sampling order of the clients. Therefore, it proves\nparticularly effective in cross-device scenarios. Furthermore, it is fast and\nefficient in terms of communication and computation costs, requiring up to two\norders of magnitude fewer resources than the competitors. Finally, we propose\nto leverage the Fed3R parameters as an initialization for a softmax classifier\nand subsequently fine-tune the model using any FL algorithm (Fed3R with\nFine-Tuning, Fed3R+FT). Our findings also indicate that maintaining a fixed\nclassifier aids in stabilizing the training and learning more discriminative\nfeatures in cross-device settings.

    "abstract": "The field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) relies on accurate\ntraffic forecasting to enable various downstream applications. However,\ndeveloping cities often face challenges in collecting sufficient training\ntraffic data due to limited resources and outdated infrastructure. Recognizing\nthis obstacle, the concept of cross-city few-shot forecasting has emerged as a\nviable approach. While previous cross-city few-shot forecasting methods ignore\nthe frequency similarity between cities, we have made an observation that the\ntraffic data is more similar in the frequency domain between cities.

The primary data\nvaluation methodology is based on the Shapley value from game theory, and\nvarious methods are proposed along this path. {Even though Shapley value-based\nvaluation has solid theoretical basis, it is entirely an experiment-based\napproach and no valuation model has been constructed so far.} In addition,\ncurrent data valuation methods ignore the interpretability of the output\nvalues, despite an interptable data valuation method is of great helpful for\napplications such as data pricing.

    "abstract": "The emergence of deep and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs)\nexhibiting high performance across diverse complex datasets has led to a need\nfor compressing network models due to the presence of a significant number of\nredundant structural units, aiming to more effectively leverage their low-power\nconsumption and biological interpretability advantages. Currently, most model\ncompression techniques for SNNs are based on unstructured pruning of individual\nconnections, which requires specific hardware support. Hence, we propose a\nstructured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional\nkernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework.\nInspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, our method dynamically adjusts the\nnetwork's structure by pruning and regenerating convolutional kernels during\ntraining, enhancing the model's adaptation to the current target task. While\nmaintaining model performance, this approach refines the network architecture,\nultimately reducing computational load and accelerating the inference process.\nThis indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better\nfacilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency\nscenarios.",

However, applying model-based offline RL to online systems\npresents challenges, primarily due to the highly suboptimal (noise-filled) and\ndiverse nature of datasets generated by online systems. To tackle these issues,\nwe introduce the Causal Prompting Reinforcement Learning (CPRL) framework,\ndesigned for highly suboptimal and resource-constrained online scenarios. The\ninitial phase of CPRL involves the introduction of the Hidden-Parameter Block\nCausal Prompting Dynamic (Hip-BCPD) to model environmental dynamics. This\napproach utilises invariant causal prompts and aligns hidden parameters to\ngeneralise to new and diverse online users. In the subsequent phase, a single\npolicy is trained to address multiple tasks through the amalgamation of\nreusable skills, circumventing the need for training from scratch. Experiments\nconducted across datasets with varying levels of noise, including\nsimulation-based and real-world offline datasets from the Dnurse APP,\ndemonstrate that our proposed method can make robust decisions in\nout-of-distribution and noisy environments, outperforming contemporary\nalgorithms. Additionally, we separately verify the contributions of Hip-BCPDs\nand the skill-reuse strategy to the robustness of performance. We further\nanalyse the visualised structure of Hip-BCPD and the interpretability of\nsub-skills.

    "abstract": "In recent research, Tensor Product Representation (TPR) is applied for the\nsystematic generalization task of deep neural networks by learning the\ncompositional structure of data. However, such prior works show limited\nperformance in discovering and representing the symbolic structure from unseen\ntest data because their decomposition to the structural representations was\nincomplete. In this work, we propose an Attention-based Iterative Decomposition\n(AID) module designed to enhance the decomposition operations for the\nstructured representations encoded from the sequential input data with TPR. Our\nAID can be easily adapted to any TPR-based model and provides enhanced\nsystematic decomposition through a competitive attention mechanism between\ninput features and structured representations. In our experiments, AID shows\neffectiveness by significantly improving the performance of TPR-based prior\nworks on the series of systematic generalization tasks. Moreover, in the\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, AID produces more compositional and\nwell-bound structural representations than other works.",

One approach for\ndetecting and tracking surrounding traffic participants is the combination of a\nlearning based object detector with a classical tracking algorithm.

    "abstract": "In the training of large language models, parameter-efficient techniques such\nas LoRA optimize memory usage and reduce communication overhead and memory\nusage during the fine-tuning phase. However, applying such techniques directly\nduring the pre-training phase results in poor performance, primarily because\nthe premature implementation of low-rank training significantly reduces model\naccuracy. Existing methods like ReLoRA and GaLore have attempted to address\nthis challenge by updating the low-rank subspace. However, they still fall\nshort of achieving the accuracy of full-rank training. Specifically, ReLoRA\nrestricts the frequency of updates to preserve optimizer states consistency,\nhindering its ability to closely approximate full-rank training behavior.\nMeanwhile, GaLore relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to approximate\nthe full-rank space, which introduces accuracy loss during the approximation\nprocess. In this paper, we introduce SwitchLoRA, a parameter-efficient training\ntechnique that frequently and smoothly replaces the trainable parameters of\nLoRA adapters with alternative parameters. SwitchLoRA updates the low-rank\nsubspace incrementally, targeting only a few dimensions at a time to minimize\nthe impact on optimizer states. This allows a higher update frequency, thereby\nenhancing accuracy by enabling the updated parameters to more closely mimic\nfull-rank behavior during the pre-training phase. Our results demonstrate that\nSwitchLoRA actually surpasses full-rank training, reducing perplexity from\n15.23 to 15.01 on the LLaMA 1.3B model, while also cutting communication\noverhead by 54\\% and memory usage by 13\\%. Furthermore, after full fine-tuning\nthe SwitchLoRA pre-trained model and the full-rank pre-trained model on the\nGLUE benchmark, the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model showed an average accuracy\ngain of about 1\\% over the full-rank pre-trained model.",

We introduce a novel strategy, monologue\nreasoning, to train Code LLMs to reason comprehensive semantics, encompassing\nhigh-level functional descriptions, local execution effects of individual\nstatements, and overall input/output behavior, thereby linking static code text\nwith dynamic execution states. We begin by collecting PyX, a clean Python\ncorpus of fully executable code samples with functional descriptions and test\ncases. We propose training Code LLMs not only to write code but also to\nunderstand code semantics by reasoning about key properties, constraints, and\nexecution behaviors using natural language, mimicking human verbal debugging,\ni.e., rubber-duck debugging. This approach led to the development of SemCoder,\na Code LLM with only 6.7B parameters, which shows competitive performance with\nGPT-3.5-turbo on code generation and execution reasoning tasks. SemCoder\nachieves 79.3% on HumanEval (GPT-3.5-turbo: 76.8%), 63.6% on CRUXEval-I\n(GPT-3.5-turbo: 50.3%), and 63.9% on CRUXEval-O (GPT-3.5-turbo: 59.0%).

However, despite these\nimprovements, existing vision transformers (ViTs) still struggle to capture\nfine-grained details from less prominent objects, charts, and embedded text,\nlimiting their effectiveness in certain tasks. In this paper, we extend recent\nhigh-resolution and multi-crop techniques by not only preserving the native\nresolution, but zooming in beyond it and extracting features from a large\nnumber of image sub-crops. This enhancement allows our model to better capture\nfine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of current ViTs. To manage the\nincreased token count and computational complexity, we demonstrate that a\nsimple mean-pooling aggregation over tokens is effective. Our model, Dragonfly,\nachieves competitive performance on general-domain tasks such as ScienceQA and\nAI2D, and excels in tasks requiring fine-grained image understanding, including\nTextVQA and ChartQA. Among models in the 7-8B parameter range, Dragonfly\nconsistently ranks at the top across ten general-domain benchmarks, achieving\nthe highest or second-highest scores in most cases, outperforming models that\nare significantly larger or trained on larger datasets. Our biomedical model,\nDragonfly-Med, sets new benchmarks on several medical tasks, achieving 91.6%\naccuracy on SLAKE (compared to 84.8% for Med-Gemini), a 67.1% token F1 score on\nPath-VQA (compared to 62.7% for Med-PaLM M), and state-of-the-art results\nacross the majority of image captioning tasks.

In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based\nKnowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to\nretrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then\napplies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples.\nSubsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which\nincludes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and\nurgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and\ncognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results\ndemonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and\nLlama 3 70B. GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models\nsuch as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets. However, GPT\n4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex\nsemantic information. Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination\nbased on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source\nGPT 4.0 with AGKA. In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels\nwith similar names in multi-class classification.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) utilizes retrieved texts to enhance\nlarge language models (LLMs). Studies show that while RAG provides valuable\nexternal information (benefit), it may also mislead LLMs (detriment) with noisy\nor incorrect retrieved texts. Although many existing methods attempt to\npreserve benefit and avoid detriment, they lack a theoretical explanation for\nRAG. The benefit and detriment in the next token prediction of RAG remain a\nblack box that cannot be quantified or compared in an explainable manner, so\nexisting methods are data-driven, need additional utility evaluators or\npost-hoc. This paper takes the first step towards providing a theory to explain\nand trade off the benefit and detriment in RAG. First, we model RAG as the\nfusion between distribution of LLMs knowledge and distribution of retrieved\ntexts. Then, we formalize the trade-off between the value of external knowledge\n(benefit) and its potential risk of misleading LLMs (detriment) in next token\nprediction of RAG by distribution difference in this fusion. Finally, we prove\nthat the actual effect of RAG on the token, which is the comparison between\nbenefit and detriment, can be predicted without any training or accessing the\nutility of retrieval. Based on our theory, we propose a practical novel method,\nTok-RAG, which achieves collaborative generation between the pure LLM and RAG\nat token level to preserve benefit and avoid detriment. Experiments in\nreal-world tasks using LLMs such as OPT, LLaMA-2, and Mistral show the\neffectiveness of our method and support our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, research on deep graph learning has shifted from\nstatic graphs to temporal graphs in response to real-world complex systems that\nexhibit dynamic behaviors. In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an\nordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points.\nSequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant\nbackbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising\nresults, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are\nburdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models\n(SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying\ncontinuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention\nand achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In\nthis work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to\ntemporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online\napproximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term.\nThe emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges,\nthereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model\nfor modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by outdated information and a\ntendency to generate incorrect data, commonly referred to as \"hallucinations.\"\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by combining\nthe strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models. This approach\ninvolves retrieving relevant information from a large, up-to-date dataset and\nusing it to enhance the generation process, leading to more accurate and\ncontextually appropriate responses. Despite its benefits, RAG introduces a new\nattack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced\nfrom public data, such as the web. In this paper, we propose \\TrojRAG{} to\nidentify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and\ntheir indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs). Specifically, we identify\nthat poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval\nbackdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns\ncustomized poisoned adversarial queries. Triggers and poisoned passages can be\nhighly customized to implement various attacks. For example, a trigger could be\na semantic group like \"The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc.\" Adversarial\npassages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers\nbut also used to indirectly attack generative LLMs without modifying them.\nThese attacks can include denial-of-service attacks on RAG and semantic\nsteering attacks on LLM generations conditioned by the triggers. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that by just poisoning 10 adversarial passages can\ninduce 98.2\\% success rate to retrieve the adversarial passages. Then, these\npassages can increase the reject ratio of RAG-based GPT-4 from 0.01\\% to 74.6\\%\nor increase the rate of negative responses from 0.22\\% to 72\\% for targeted\nqueries.",

    "abstract": "Users typically engage with LLMs interactively, yet most existing benchmarks\nevaluate them in a static, single-turn format, posing reliability concerns in\ninteractive scenarios. We identify a key obstacle towards reliability: LLMs are\ntrained to answer any question, even with incomplete context or insufficient\nknowledge. In this paper, we propose to change the static paradigm to an\ninteractive one, develop systems that proactively ask questions to gather more\ninformation and respond reliably, and introduce an benchmark - MediQ - to\nevaluate question-asking ability in LLMs. MediQ simulates clinical interactions\nconsisting of a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System; with potentially\nincomplete initial information, the Expert refrains from making diagnostic\ndecisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details via follow-up\nquestions. We provide a pipeline to convert single-turn medical benchmarks into\nan interactive format. Our results show that directly prompting\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades performance, indicating that\nadapting LLMs to proactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial. We\nexperiment with abstention strategies to better estimate model confidence and\ndecide when to ask questions, improving diagnostic accuracy by 22.3%; however,\nperformance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound\nwith complete information upfront. Further analyses show improved interactive\nperformance with filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations.\nOverall, we introduce a novel problem towards LLM reliability, an interactive\nMediQ benchmark and a novel question-asking system, and highlight directions to\nextend LLMs' information-seeking abilities in critical domains.",

Existing statistical and deep\nlearning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale\ntraining data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series\nwith textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we\ndiscovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled\nembeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF\nvia cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding\nwith two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet\nweak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the\nsame time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt\nembeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both\ndisentangled and robust time series embeddings, \"the best of two worlds\", from\nthe prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As\nanother key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with\ntheir length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the\nmost essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only\nthe last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last\ntoken embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight\nreal datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A\nstrategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned\nBird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual\nsensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems,\nthis provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with\ndifferent views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor\ninformation over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems\nto account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby,\nthe effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators\nused to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation\nspaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their\neffectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent\nrepresentations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information\neither in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance\ncomparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary\nstrengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which\nintegrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider\nsubsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from\noptical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on\nthe NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the\nbaseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a\nstrong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space.\nThese results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a\nstrong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent\nspaces.",

To\nachieve joint human-AV action goals - such as safe transportation, trust, or\nlearning from an AV - sufficient situational awareness must be held by the\nhuman, AV, and human-AV system collectively. We present a systems-level\nframework that integrates cognitive theories of joint action and situational\nawareness as a means to tailor communications that meet the criteria necessary\nfor goal success. This framework is based on four components of the shared\nsituation: AV traits, action goals, subject-specific traits and states, and the\nsituated driving context. AV communications should be tailored to these factors\nand be sensitive when they change. This framework can be useful for\nunderstanding individual, shared, and distributed human-AV situational\nawareness and designing for future AV communications that meet the\ninformational needs and goals of diverse groups and in diverse driving\ncontexts.",

This problem is often\ndue to limited training data, exacerbated by the use of supervised\nclassification frameworks that are known to be suboptimal in such settings. In\nthis work, we propose a shift to deep metric-based meta-learning in EMG PR to\nsupervise the creation of meaningful and interpretable representations. We use\na Siamese Deep Convolutional Neural Network (SDCNN) and contrastive triplet\nloss to learn an EMG feature embedding space that captures the distribution of\nthe different classes. A nearest-centroid approach is subsequently employed for\ninference, relying on how closely a test sample aligns with the established\ndata distributions. We derive a robust class proximity-based confidence\nestimator that leads to a better rejection of incorrect decisions, i.e. false\npositives, especially when operating beyond the training data domain. We show\nour approach's efficacy by testing the trained SDCNN's predictions and\nconfidence estimations on unseen data, both in and out of the training domain.\nThe evaluation metrics include the accuracy-rejection curve and the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the confidence distributions of accurate\nand inaccurate predictions. Outperforming comparable models on both metrics,\nour results demonstrate that the proposed meta-learning approach improves the\nclassifier's precision in active decisions (after rejection), thus leading to\nbetter generalization and applicability.",

The major success of GPT-type of\nlanguage models is particularly exciting and raises expectations on the\npotential of foundation models in other domains including satellite remote\nsensing. In this context, great efforts have been made to build foundation\nmodels to test their capabilities in broader applications, and examples include\nPrithvi by NASA-IBM, Segment-Anything-Model, ViT, etc. This leads to an\nimportant question: Are foundation models always a suitable choice for\ndifferent remote sensing tasks, and when or when not? This work aims to enhance\nthe understanding of the status and suitability of foundation models for\npixel-level classification using multispectral imagery at moderate resolution,\nthrough comparisons with traditional machine learning (ML) and regular-size\ndeep learning models. Interestingly, the results reveal that in many scenarios\ntraditional ML models still have similar or better performance compared to\nfoundation models, especially for tasks where texture is less useful for\nclassification. On the other hand, deep learning models did show more promising\nresults for tasks where labels partially depend on texture (e.g., burn scar),\nwhile the difference in performance between foundation models and deep learning\nmodels is not obvious. The results conform with our analysis: The suitability\nof foundation models depend on the alignment between the self-supervised\nlearning tasks and the real downstream tasks, and the typical masked\nautoencoder paradigm is not necessarily suitable for many remote sensing\nproblems.",

In particular, the randomized nature of\nLLMs, coupled with inherent biases and historical stereotypes in data, raises\ncritical concerns regarding reliability and equity. Addressing these challenges\nare necessary before using LLMs for applications with societal impact. Towards\naddressing this gap, we introduce REQUAL-LM, a novel method for finding\nreliable and equitable LLM outputs through aggregation. Specifically, we\ndevelop a Monte Carlo method based on repeated sampling to find a reliable\noutput close to the mean of the underlying distribution of possible outputs. We\nformally define the terms such as reliability and bias, and design an\nequity-aware aggregation to minimize harmful bias while finding a highly\nreliable output. REQUAL-LM does not require specialized hardware, does not\nimpose a significant computing load, and uses LLMs as a blackbox. This design\nchoice enables seamless scalability alongside the rapid advancement of LLM\ntechnologies. Our system does not require retraining the LLMs, which makes it\ndeployment ready and easy to adapt. Our comprehensive experiments using various\ntasks and datasets demonstrate that REQUAL- LM effectively mitigates bias and\nselects a more equitable response, specifically the outputs that properly\nrepresents minority groups.",

To tackle this scenario, we presented the Scene\nIdentification and Tagging (SIT) algorithm, which bootstraps structured\nknowledge representation in a crisp OWL-DL ontology. Over time, SIT bootstraps\na graph representing scenes, sub-scenes and similar scenes. Then, SIT can\nclassify new scenes within the bootstrapped graph through logic-based\nreasoning. However, SIT has issues with sensory data because its crisp\nimplementation is not robust to perception noises. This paper presents a\nreformulation of SIT within the fuzzy domain, which exploits a fuzzy DL\nontology to overcome the robustness issues. By comparing the performances of\nfuzzy and crisp implementations of SIT, we show that fuzzy SIT is robust,\npreserves the properties of its crisp formulation, and enhances the\nbootstrapped representations.

However, this step introduces at\nleast two families of uncontrollable biases. The first is caused by the changes\nmade by the segmentation process on the initial problem space, such as dividing\nthe input data into 60 seconds windows. The second category of biases results\nfrom the segmentation process itself, including the fixation of the\nsegmentation method and its parameters.\n  To address these biases, we propose to redefine the segmentation problem as a\nspecial case of a decomposition problem, including three key components: a\ndecomposer, resolutions, and a composer.\n  The inclusion of the composer task in the segmentation process facilitates an\nassessment of the relationship between the original problem and the problem\nafter the segmentation. Therefore, It leads to an improvement in the evaluation\nprocess and, consequently, in the selection of the appropriate segmentation\nmethod.\n  Then, we formally introduce our novel meta-decomposition or\nlearning-to-decompose approach. It reduces the segmentation biases by\nconsidering the segmentation as a hyperparameter to be optimized by the outer\nlearning problem. Therefore, meta-decomposition improves the overall system\nperformance by dynamically selecting the appropriate segmentation method\nwithout including the mentioned biases.

    "abstract": "In remote sensing, we are interested in modeling various modalities for some\ngeographic location. Several works have focused on learning the relationship\nbetween a location and type of landscape, habitability, audio, textual\ndescriptions, etc. Recently, a common way to approach these problems is to\ntrain a deep-learning model that uses satellite images to infer some unique\ncharacteristics of the location. In this work, we present a deep-learning\nmodel, GeoBind, that can infer about multiple modalities, specifically text,\nimage, and audio, from satellite imagery of a location. To do this, we use\nsatellite images as the binding element and contrastively align all other\nmodalities to the satellite image data. Our training results in a joint\nembedding space with multiple types of data: satellite image, ground-level\nimage, audio, and text. Furthermore, our approach does not require a single\ncomplex dataset that contains all the modalities mentioned above. Rather it\nonly requires multiple satellite-image paired data. While we only align three\nmodalities in this paper, we present a general framework that can be used to\ncreate an embedding space with any number of modalities by using satellite\nimages as the binding element. Our results show that, unlike traditional\nunimodal models, GeoBind is versatile and can reason about multiple modalities\nfor a given satellite image input.",

Although\nlarge FMs have demonstrated significant impact in natural language processing\nand computer vision, efforts toward FMs for geospatial applications have been\nrestricted to smaller size models, as pretraining larger models requires very\nlarge computing resources equipped with state-of-the-art hardware accelerators.\nCurrent satellite constellations collect 100+TBs of data a day, resulting in\nimages that are billions of pixels and multimodal in nature.

    "abstract": "Understanding the real world through point cloud video is a crucial aspect of\nrobotics and autonomous driving systems. However, prevailing methods for 4D\npoint cloud recognition have limitations due to sensor resolution, which leads\nto a lack of detailed information. Recent advances have shown that\nVision-Language Models (VLM) pre-trained on web-scale text-image datasets can\nlearn fine-grained visual concepts that can be transferred to various\ndownstream tasks. However, effectively integrating VLM into the domain of 4D\npoint clouds remains an unresolved problem. In this work, we propose the\nVision-Language Models Goes 4D (VG4D) framework to transfer VLM knowledge from\nvisual-text pre-trained models to a 4D point cloud network. Our approach\ninvolves aligning the 4D encoder's representation with a VLM to learn a shared\nvisual and text space from training on large-scale image-text pairs. By\ntransferring the knowledge of the VLM to the 4D encoder and combining the VLM,\nour VG4D achieves improved recognition performance. To enhance the 4D encoder,\nwe modernize the classic dynamic point cloud backbone and propose an improved\nversion of PSTNet, im-PSTNet, which can efficiently model point cloud videos.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance\nfor action recognition on both the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset and the NTU RGB+D 120\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offers a precise means for constraining the\nbehavior of reinforcement learning agents. However, in many settings where both\nsatisfaction and optimality conditions are present, LTL is insufficient to\ncapture both. Instead, LTL-constrained policy optimization, where the goal is\nto optimize a scalar reward under LTL constraints, is needed. This constrained\noptimization problem proves difficult in deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nsettings, where learned policies often ignore the LTL constraint due to the\nsparse nature of LTL satisfaction. To alleviate the sparsity issue, we\nintroduce Cycle Experience Replay (CyclER), a novel reward shaping technique\nthat exploits the underlying structure of the LTL constraint to guide a policy\ntowards satisfaction by encouraging partial behaviors compliant with the\nconstraint. We provide a theoretical guarantee that optimizing CyclER will\nachieve policies that satisfy the LTL constraint with near-optimal probability.\nWe evaluate CyclER in three continuous control domains. Our experimental\nresults show that optimizing CyclER in tandem with the existing scalar reward\noutperforms existing reward-shaping methods at finding performant\nLTL-satisfying policies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new architecture for personalization of text-to-image\ndiffusion models, coined Mixture-of-Attention (MoA). Inspired by the\nMixture-of-Experts mechanism utilized in large language models (LLMs), MoA\ndistributes the generation workload between two attention pathways: a\npersonalized branch and a non-personalized prior branch. MoA is designed to\nretain the original model's prior by fixing its attention layers in the prior\nbranch, while minimally intervening in the generation process with the\npersonalized branch that learns to embed subjects in the layout and context\ngenerated by the prior branch. A novel routing mechanism manages the\ndistribution of pixels in each layer across these branches to optimize the\nblend of personalized and generic content creation. Once trained, MoA\nfacilitates the creation of high-quality, personalized images featuring\nmultiple subjects with compositions and interactions as diverse as those\ngenerated by the original model. Crucially, MoA enhances the distinction\nbetween the model's pre-existing capability and the newly augmented\npersonalized intervention, thereby offering a more disentangled subject-context\ncontrol that was previously unattainable.

Currently, there is a lack of quantitative methods to\nevaluate the performance of LLMs in these low-resource languages. To address\nthis gap, we propose the Language Ranker, an intrinsic metric designed to\nbenchmark and rank languages based on LLM performance using internal\nrepresentations. By comparing the LLM's internal representation of various\nlanguages against a baseline derived from English, we can assess the model's\nmultilingual capabilities in a robust and language-agnostic manner. Our\nanalysis reveals that high-resource languages exhibit higher similarity scores\nwith English, demonstrating superior performance, while low-resource languages\nshow lower similarity scores, underscoring the effectiveness of our metric in\nassessing language-specific capabilities. Besides, the experiments show that\nthere is a strong correlation between the LLM's performance in different\nlanguages and the proportion of those languages in its pre-training corpus.\nThese insights underscore the efficacy of the Language Ranker as a tool for\nevaluating LLM performance across different languages, particularly those with\nlimited resources.",

Second, the sub-FM alignment module conducts a two-step\ndistillations-layer-level and neuron-level-before and during FL fine-tuning\nrespectively, to reduce error of gradient by accurately aligning sub-FM with FM\nunder theoretical guarantees.

However, current\nstate-of-the-art approaches rely on scarce linguistic resources to work. This\nhas limited progress in the field. This paper introduces an innovative solution\nby transforming the continuous pose generation problem into a discrete sequence\ngeneration problem. Thus, overcoming the need for costly annotation.

Then using a transformer we perform a translation from spoken\nlanguage text to a sequence of codebook tokens.

The user then puts together chains of nodes,\nlike stacking LEGO pieces. The chains of nodes can be designed to explicitly\nenforce a naturally structured \"thought process\". For example, for the task of\nwriting a paper, one may start with the thought process of 1) identify a core\nmessage, 2) identify prior research gaps, etc. The nodes in AgentKit can be\ndesigned and combined in different ways to implement multiple advanced\ncapabilities including on-the-fly hierarchical planning, reflection, and\nlearning from interactions. In addition, due to the modular nature and the\nintuitive design to simulate explicit human thought process, a basic agent\ncould be implemented as simple as a list of prompts for the subtasks and\ntherefore could be designed and tuned by someone without any programming\nexperience. Quantitatively, we show that agents designed through AgentKit\nachieve SOTA performance on WebShop and Crafter. These advances underscore\nAgentKit's potential in making LLM agents effective and accessible for a wider\nrange of applications. https://github.com/holmeswww/AgentKit",

    "abstract": "Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe\nspecific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However,\ndeveloping a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei\nremains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine\nLearning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify\nalternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To\naddress this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic\nRegression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target\nobservables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against\nhigh-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to\ndescribe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass\nnuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the\nnumber of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision\ncomparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this\nML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits\nof nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to\ndevelop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body\nproblems.",

Despite being effective, such\nmethods inevitably entail considerable storage costs and computational\noverheads due to the reliance on task-specific networks. In this work, we go\nbeyond this well-established framework and exploit the inherent commonalities\namong image restoration tasks. The primary objective is to identify components\nthat are shareable across restoration tasks and augment the shared components\nwith modules specifically trained for individual tasks. Towards this goal, we\npropose AdaIR, a novel framework that enables low storage cost and efficient\ntraining without sacrificing performance. Specifically, a generic restoration\nnetwork is first constructed through self-supervised pre-training using\nsynthetic degradations. Subsequent to the pre-training phase, adapters are\ntrained to adapt the pre-trained network to specific degradations. AdaIR\nrequires solely the training of lightweight, task-specific modules, ensuring a\nmore efficient storage and training regimen. We have conducted extensive\nexperiments to validate the effectiveness of AdaIR and analyze the influence of\nthe pre-training strategy on discovering shareable components. Extensive\nexperimental results show that AdaIR achieves outstanding results on multi-task\nrestoration while utilizing significantly fewer parameters (1.9 MB) and less\ntraining time (7 hours) for each restoration task.

One-to-one here means that the transported people or goods are\nassociated with designated pairs of pickup and delivery nodes, in contrast to\nthat indistinguishable goods can be delivered to any nodes. In PDTSP,\nprecedence constraints need to be satisfied that each pickup node must be\nvisited before its corresponding delivery node.

The basic idea\nis to explore and evaluate visiting sequences in a solution space. However,\nthis approach could be less computationally efficient, as it has to potentially\nevaluate many infeasible solutions of which precedence constraints are\nviolated. To restrict solution search within a feasible space, we utilize\noperators that always map one feasible solution to another, without spending\ntime exploring the infeasible solution space. Such operators are evaluated and\nselected as policies to solve PDTSPs in an RL framework.

Nevertheless, on account of\ntheir nonlinear and non-stationary nature, their short-term forecast is\nextremely challenging. Therefore, this dissertation raises one short-term wind\nspeed forecast pattern on the foundation of attention with an improved gated\nrecurrent neural network (AtGRU) and a tactic of error correction. That model\nuses the AtGRU model as the preliminary predictor and the GRU model as the\nerror corrector. At the beginning, SSA (singular spectrum analysis) is employed\nin previous wind speed series for lessening the noise. Subsequently, historical\nwind speed series is going to be used for the predictor training. During this\nprocess, the prediction can have certain errors. The sequence of these errors\nprocessed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used to train the\ncorrector of error. The eventual forecast consequence is just the sum of\npredictor forecast and error corrector. The proposed SSA-AtGRU-VMD-GRU model\noutperforms the compared models in three case studies on Woodburn, St. Thomas,\nand Santa Cruz. It is indicated that the model evidently enhances the\ncorrection of the wind speed forecast.",

    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as\nengineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability\nof an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its\naccuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve\ncalibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to\ncomputational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling\nstrategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an\nextension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates\ncalibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization\nfor OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of\ncalibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is\nconstructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian\nlearning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization\n(OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to\nproduce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs\nfor which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical\nresults illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD\ncalibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among\nthe main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance\nas compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a\nsufficiently large number of inputs.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering recommender systems (CF-RecSys) have shown successive\nresults in enhancing the user experience on social media and e-commerce\nplatforms. However, as CF-RecSys struggles under cold scenarios with sparse\nuser-item interactions, recent strategies have focused on leveraging modality\ninformation of user/items (e.g., text or images) based on pre-trained modality\nencoders and Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their effectiveness under\ncold scenarios, we observe that they underperform simple traditional\ncollaborative filtering models under warm scenarios due to the lack of\ncollaborative knowledge. In this work, we propose an efficient All-round\nLLM-based Recommender system, called A-LLMRec, that excels not only in the cold\nscenario but also in the warm scenario. Our main idea is to enable an LLM to\ndirectly leverage the collaborative knowledge contained in a pre-trained\nstate-of-the-art CF-RecSys so that the emergent ability of the LLM as well as\nthe high-quality user/item embeddings that are already trained by the\nstate-of-the-art CF-RecSys can be jointly exploited. This approach yields two\nadvantages: (1) model-agnostic, allowing for integration with various existing\nCF-RecSys, and (2) efficiency, eliminating the extensive fine-tuning typically\nrequired for LLM-based recommenders. Our extensive experiments on various\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A-LLMRec in various\nscenarios, including cold/warm, few-shot, cold user, and cross-domain\nscenarios. Beyond the recommendation task, we also show the potential of\nA-LLMRec in generating natural language outputs based on the understanding of\nthe collaborative knowledge by performing a favorite genre prediction task.

This tracking and\nidentification process is crucial for reconstructing the game state, defined by\nthe athletes' positions and identities on a 2D top-view of the pitch, (i.e. a\nminimap). However, reconstructing the game state from videos captured by a\nsingle camera is challenging.

Furthermore, existing methods commonly use in-batch negative\nsampling, which reduces the negative number available for the model.

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis aims to gauge students' mastery levels based on their\nresponse logs. Serving as a pivotal module in web-based online intelligent\neducation systems (WOIESs), it plays an upstream and fundamental role in\ndownstream tasks like learning item recommendation and computerized adaptive\ntesting. WOIESs are open learning environment where numerous new students\nconstantly register and complete exercises. In WOIESs, efficient cognitive\ndiagnosis is crucial to fast feedback and accelerating student learning.\nHowever, the existing cognitive diagnosis methods always employ intrinsically\ntransductive student-specific embeddings, which become slow and costly due to\nretraining when dealing with new students who are unseen during training. To\nthis end, this paper proposes an inductive cognitive diagnosis model (ICDM) for\nfast new students' mastery levels inference in WOIESs. Specifically, in ICDM,\nwe propose a novel student-centered graph (SCG). Rather than inferring mastery\nlevels through updating student-specific embedding, we derive the inductive\nmastery levels as the aggregated outcomes of students' neighbors in SCG.\nNamely, SCG enables to shift the task from finding the most suitable\nstudent-specific embedding that fits the response logs to finding the most\nsuitable representations for different node types in SCG, and the latter is\nmore efficient since it no longer requires retraining. To obtain this\nrepresentation, ICDM consists of a\nconstruction-aggregation-generation-transformation process to learn the final\nrepresentation of students, exercises and concepts. Extensive experiments\nacross real-world datasets show that, compared with the existing cognitive\ndiagnosis methods that are always transductive, ICDM is much more faster while\nmaintains the competitive inference performance for new students.",

To realize this concept,\nsemantic-information-based communication, called semantic communication, has\nbeen proposed, along with an image transmission method using semantic\ncommunication. This method transmits only the semantic information of an image,\nand the receiver reconstructs it using an image-generation model. This method\nutilizes a single type of semantic information for image reconstruction, but\nreconstructing images similar to the original image using only this information\nis challenging. This study proposes a multi-modal image transmission method\nthat leverages various types of semantic information for efficient semantic\ncommunication. The proposed method extracts multi-modal semantic information\nfrom an original image and transmits only that to a receiver. Subsequently, the\nreceiver generates multiple images using an image-generation model and selects\nan output image based on semantic similarity. The receiver must select the\nresult based only on the received features; however, evaluating the similarity\nusing conventional metrics is challenging. Therefore, this study explores new\nmetrics to evaluate the similarity between semantic features of images and\nproposes two scoring procedures for evaluating semantic similarity between\nimages based on multiple semantic features. The results indicate that the\nproposed procedures can compare semantic similarities, such as position and\ncomposition, between the semantic features of the original and generated\nimages.",

    "abstract": "Comparing images captured by disparate sensors is a common challenge in\nremote sensing. This requires image translation -- converting imagery from one\nsensor domain to another while preserving the original content. Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) are potential state-of-the-art solutions for\nsuch domain translation due to their proven superiority in multiple\nimage-to-image translation tasks in computer vision. However, these models\nstruggle with reproducing radiometric features of large-scale multi-patch\nimagery, resulting in inconsistencies across the full image. This renders\ndownstream tasks like Heterogeneous Change Detection impractical. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose a method that leverages denoising diffusion for\neffective multi-sensor optical image translation over large areas. Our approach\nsuper-resolves large-scale low spatial resolution images into high-resolution\nequivalents from disparate optical sensors, ensuring uniformity across hundreds\nof patches. Our contributions lie in new forward and reverse diffusion\nprocesses that address the challenges of large-scale image translation.\nExtensive experiments using paired Sentinel-II (10m) and Planet Dove (3m)\nimages demonstrate that our approach provides precise domain adaptation,\npreserving image content while improving radiometric accuracy and feature\nrepresentation. A thorough image quality assessment and comparisons with the\nstandard DDIM framework and five other leading methods are presented. We reach\na mean Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (mLPIPS) of 0.1884 and a\nFr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 45.64, expressively outperforming all\ncompared methods, including DDIM, ShuffleMixer, and SwinIR. The usefulness of\nour approach is further demonstrated in two Heterogeneous Change Detection\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "Clover fixates nitrogen from the atmosphere to the ground, making\ngrass-clover mixtures highly desirable to reduce external nitrogen\nfertilization. Herbage containing clover additionally promotes higher food\nintake, resulting in higher milk production. Herbage probing however remains\nlargely unused as it requires a time-intensive manual laboratory analysis.\nWithout this information, farmers are unable to perform localized clover sowing\nor take targeted fertilization decisions. Deep learning algorithms have been\nproposed with the goal to estimate the dry biomass composition from images of\nthe grass directly in the fields. The energy-intensive nature of deep learning\nhowever limits deployment to practical edge devices such as smartphones. This\npaper proposes to fill this gap by applying filter pruning to reduce the energy\nrequirement of existing deep learning solutions. We report that although pruned\nnetworks are accurate on controlled, high-quality images of the grass, they\nstruggle to generalize to real-world smartphone images that are blurry or taken\nfrom challenging angles. We address this challenge by training filter-pruned\nmodels using a variance attenuation loss so they can predict the uncertainty of\ntheir predictions. When the uncertainty exceeds a threshold, we re-infer using\na more accurate unpruned model. This hybrid approach allows us to reduce energy\nconsumption while retaining a high accuracy. We evaluate our algorithm on two\ndatasets: the GrassClover and the Irish clover using an NVIDIA Jetson Nano edge\ndevice. We find that we reduce energy reduction with respect to\nstate-of-the-art solutions by 50% on average with only 4% accuracy loss.",

However, sEMG is easily influenced by\nvarious forms of noise in real-world environments, leading to challenges in\nproviding long-term stable interactions through sEMG. Existing methods often\nstruggle to enhance model noise resilience through various predefined data\naugmentation techniques. In this work, we revisit the problem from a short term\nenhancement perspective to improve precision and robustness against various\ncommon noisy scenarios with learnable denoise using sEMG intrinsic pattern\ninformation and sliding-window attention. We propose a Short Term Enhancement\nModule(STEM) which can be easily integrated with various models.

In particular, we\nincorporate STEM into a transformer, creating the Short Term Enhanced\nTransformer (STET).

As a consequence, the field of eXplainable AI (or XAI) has become\npopular in recent years. One way to explain AI models is to elucidate the\npredictive importance of the input features for the AI model in general, also\nreferred to as global explanations. Inspired by cooperative game theory,\nShapley values offer a convenient way for quantifying the feature importance as\nexplanations.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel setting where we aim to improve the performance of diverse\nMLLMs with a group of shared parameters optimized for a downstream task. To\nachieve this, we propose Transferable Visual Prompting (TVP), a simple and\neffective approach to generate visual prompts that can transfer to different\nmodels and improve their performance on downstream tasks after trained on only\none model. We introduce two strategies to address the issue of cross-model\nfeature corruption of existing visual prompting methods and enhance the\ntransferability of the learned prompts, including 1) Feature Consistency\nAlignment: which imposes constraints to the prompted feature changes to\nmaintain task-agnostic knowledge; 2) Task Semantics Enrichment: which\nencourages the prompted images to contain richer task-specific semantics with\nlanguage guidance. We validate the effectiveness of TVP through extensive\nexperiments with 6 modern MLLMs on a wide variety of tasks ranging from object\nrecognition and counting to multimodal reasoning and hallucination correction.",

    "abstract": "As the global population ages, the incidence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\nis rising. CKD often remains asymptomatic until advanced stages, which\nsignificantly burdens both the healthcare system and patient quality of life.\nThis research developed an explainable machine learning system for predicting\nCKD in patients with cardiovascular risks, utilizing medical history and\nlaboratory data. The Random Forest model achieved the highest sensitivity of\n88.2%. The study introduces a comprehensive explainability framework that\nextends beyond traditional feature importance methods, incorporating global and\nlocal interpretations, bias inspection, biomedical relevance, and safety\nassessments. Key predictive features identified in global interpretation were\nthe use of diabetic and ACEI/ARB medications, and initial eGFR values. Local\ninterpretation provided model insights through counterfactual explanations,\nwhich aligned with other system parts. After conducting a bias inspection, it\nwas found that the initial eGFR values and CKD predictions exhibited some bias,\nbut no significant gender bias was identified. The model's logic, extracted by\nscoped rules, was confirmed to align with existing medical literature. The\nsafety assessment tested potentially dangerous cases and confirmed that the\nmodel behaved safely. This system enhances the explainability, reliability, and\naccountability of the model, promoting its potential integration into\nhealthcare settings and compliance with upcoming regulatory standards, and\nshowing promise for broader applications in healthcare machine learning.",

Our\ncontributions are three-fold: (1) Using several hyperparameters, we propose a\nparametric PSRO that unifies the gradient descent ascent (GDA) and different\nPSRO variants. (2) We propose the self-adaptive PSRO (SPSRO) by casting the\nhyperparameter value selection of the parametric PSRO as a hyperparameter\noptimization (HPO) problem where our objective is to learn an HPO policy that\ncan self-adaptively determine the optimal hyperparameter values during the\nrunning of the parametric PSRO. (3) To overcome the poor performance of online\nHPO methods, we propose a novel offline HPO approach to optimize the HPO policy\nbased on the Transformer architecture.

Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to\nprovide effective protection. Specifically, we identify four critical\nprotection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1)\nmaintaining protection after a model is physically copied; (2) authorizing\nmodel access at request level; (3) safeguarding runtime reverse engineering;\n(4) achieving high security with negligible runtime overhead. To address the\nabove issues, we propose TransLinkGuard, a plug-and-play model protection\napproach against model stealing on edge devices.

Therefore,\nexisting approaches adopt the two-stage \"detect-then-describe/discriminate\"\npipeline, which relies heavily on the performance of the detector, resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. Inspired by DETR, we propose a unified framework,\n3DGCTR, to jointly solve these two distinct but closely related tasks in an\nend-to-end fashion. The key idea is to reconsider the prompt-based localization\nability of the 3DVG model. In this way, the 3DVG model with a well-designed\nprompt as input can assist the 3DDC task by extracting localization information\nfrom the prompt. In terms of implementation, we integrate a Lightweight Caption\nHead into the existing 3DVG network with a Caption Text Prompt as a connection,\neffectively harnessing the existing 3DVG model's inherent localization\ncapacity, thereby boosting 3DDC capability. This integration facilitates\nsimultaneous multi-task training on both tasks, mutually enhancing their\nperformance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthis approach. Specifically, on the ScanRefer dataset, 3DGCTR surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art 3DDC method by 4.3% in CIDEr@0.5IoU in MLE training and\nimproves upon the SOTA 3DVG method by 3.16% in Acc@0.25IoU.

This paper\nformulates human value alignment as an optimization problem of the language\nmodel policy to maximize reward under a safety constraint, and then proposes an\nalgorithm, Stepwise Alignment for Constrained Policy Optimization (SACPO). One\nkey idea behind SACPO, supported by theory, is that the optimal policy\nincorporating reward and safety can be directly obtained from a reward-aligned\npolicy. Building on this key idea, SACPO aligns LLMs step-wise with each metric\nwhile leveraging simple yet powerful alignment algorithms such as direct\npreference optimization (DPO). SACPO offers several advantages, including\nsimplicity, stability, computational efficiency, and flexibility of algorithms\nand datasets.

    "abstract": "Federated learning aims to tackle the ``isolated data island\" problem, where\nit trains a collective model from physically isolated clients while\nsafeguarding the privacy of users' data. However, supervised federated learning\nnecessitates that each client labels their data for training, which can be both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive, and may even be impractical for edge\ndevices. Moreover, the training and transmission of deep models present\nchallenges to the computation and communication capabilities of the clients. To\naddress these two inherent challenges in supervised federated learning, we\npropose a novel lightweight unsupervised federated learning approach that\nleverages unlabeled data on each client to perform lightweight model training\nand communication by harnessing pretrained vision-language models, such as\nCLIP. By capitalizing on the zero-shot prediction capability and the\nwell-trained image encoder of the pre-trained CLIP model, we have carefully\ncrafted an efficient and resilient self-training approach. This method refines\nthe initial zero-shot predicted pseudo-labels of unlabeled instances through\nthe sole training of a linear classifier on top of the fixed image encoder.\nAdditionally, to address data heterogeneity within each client, we propose a\nclass-balanced text feature sampling strategy for generating synthetic\ninstances in the feature space to support local training. Experiments are\nconducted on multiple benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat our proposed method greatly enhances model performance in comparison to\nCLIP's zero-shot predictions and even outperforms supervised federated learning\nbenchmark methods given limited computational and communication overhead.",

Going from few-shot\nto many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of\ngenerative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be\nbottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated examples. To mitigate\nthis limitation, we explore two new settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL.\nReinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of\nhuman examples. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether,\nand prompts the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that both\nReinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime,\nparticularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike\nfew-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining\nbiases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and\nperforms comparably to fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in various\nnatural language processing tasks, including question answering (QA) tasks.\nWhile incorporating new information with the retrieval of relevant passages is\na promising way to improve QA with LLMs, the existing methods often require\nadditional fine-tuning which becomes infeasible with recent LLMs. Augmenting\nretrieved passages via prompting has the potential to address this limitation,\nbut this direction has been limitedly explored. To this end, we design a simple\nyet effective framework to enhance open-domain QA (ODQA) with LLMs, based on\nthe summarized retrieval (SuRe). SuRe helps LLMs predict more accurate answers\nfor a given question, which are well-supported by the summarized retrieval that\ncould be viewed as an explicit rationale extracted from the retrieved passages.\nSpecifically, SuRe first constructs summaries of the retrieved passages for\neach of the multiple answer candidates. Then, SuRe confirms the most plausible\nanswer from the candidate set by evaluating the validity and ranking of the\ngenerated summaries. Experimental results on diverse ODQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of SuRe, with improvements of up to 4.6% in exact\nmatch (EM) and 4.0% in F1 score over standard prompting approaches. SuRe also\ncan be integrated with a broad range of retrieval methods and LLMs. Finally,\nthe generated summaries from SuRe show additional advantages to measure the\nimportance of retrieved passages and serve as more preferred rationales by\nmodels and humans.",

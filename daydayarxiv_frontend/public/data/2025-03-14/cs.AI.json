      "abstract": "Mitigating reward hacking--where AI systems misbehave due to flaws or\nmisspecifications in their learning objectives--remains a key challenge in\nconstructing capable and aligned models. We show that we can monitor a frontier\nreasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding\nenvironments by using another LLM that observes the model's chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning. CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent\nactions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini,\nnamely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors\ncan be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those\nexploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the\nagent's training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into\nthe reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more\naligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much\noptimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent\nwithin the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking.\nBecause it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be\nnecessary to pay a monitorability tax by not applying strong optimization\npressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain\nmonitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.",

REGEN\nextends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural\nlanguage features: (1) user critiques, representing user \"steering\" queries\nthat lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich\ntextual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior\ncontext. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations,\nand summaries of user preferences.\n  Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of\nconversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both\nrecommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items\nand critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN\n(LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and\nNarratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and\ngeneration. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating\ntechniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based\nrecommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques\nenhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language\nunderstanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs\ntrained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual\nnarratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders\nand language models.",

While recent Imitation Learning\n(IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of\nrequired demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect\nhigh-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose\nSketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch\ntrajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach\nextends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on\nimitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks.\nSketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D\nsketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect\ninitial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two\nways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine\nthis policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the\nbaseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding\nthe performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from\nsketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and\npotentially broadens its applications across various domains.",

This paper adds an additional perspective.\nThrough a case study, we demonstrate that the impact of genAI on students' idea\ndevelopment depends not only on the AI but also on the students and, crucially,\ntheir interactions in between. Students who proactively explored ideas gained\nnew ideas from writing, regardless of whether they used auto-complete or\nSocratic AI assistants.

However, existing approaches typically require\nresource-intensive re-training or additional parameters to accommodate for the\nnew tasks, which makes the model inefficient for on-device deployment. We\npropose Multi-Task Upcycling (MTU), a simple yet effective recipe that extends\nthe capabilities of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to support a\nvariety of image-to-image generation tasks. MTU replaces Feed-Forward Network\n(FFN) layers in the diffusion model with smaller FFNs, referred to as experts,\nand combines them with a dynamic routing mechanism. To the best of our\nknowledge, MTU is the first multi-task diffusion modeling approach that\nseamlessly blends multi-tasking with on-device compatibility, by mitigating the\nissue of parameter inflation. We show that the performance of MTU is on par\nwith the single-task fine-tuned diffusion models across several tasks including\nimage editing, super-resolution, and inpainting, while maintaining similar\nlatency and computational load (GFLOPs) as the single-task fine-tuned models.",

The system\ncomprises GPU and non-GPU nodes with modern AI accelerators, such as NVIDIA\nA40, A100, and H100 GPUs. The study uses two and a half years of data on GPU\nerrors. We evaluate the resilience of GPU hardware components to determine the\nvulnerability of different GPU components to failure and their impact on the\nGPU and node availability. We measure the key propagation paths in GPU\nhardware, GPU interconnect (NVLink), and GPU memory. Finally, we evaluate the\nimpact of the observed GPU errors on user jobs. Our key findings are: (i)\nContrary to common beliefs, GPU memory is over 30x more reliable than GPU\nhardware in terms of MTBE (mean time between errors). (ii) The newly introduced\nGSP (GPU System Processor) is the most vulnerable GPU hardware component. (iii)\nNVLink errors did not always lead to user job failure, and we attribute it to\nthe underlying error detection and retry mechanisms employed. (iv) We show\nmultiple examples of hardware errors originating from one of the key GPU\nhardware components, leading to application failure. (v) We project the impact\nof GPU node availability on larger scales with emulation and find that\nsignificant overprovisioning between 5-20% would be necessary to handle GPU\nfailures. If GPU availability were improved to 99.9%, the overprovisioning\nwould be reduced by 4x.",

Models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini are frequently\nevaluated on translation benchmarks and utilized as translation tools due to\ntheir high performance. This paper examines Gemini's performance in translating\nan 18th-century Ottoman Turkish manuscript, Prisoner of the Infidels: The\nMemoirs of Osman Agha of Timisoara, into English. The manuscript recounts the\nexperiences of Osman Agha, an Ottoman subject who spent 11 years as a prisoner\nof war in Austria, and includes his accounts of warfare and violence. Our\nanalysis reveals that Gemini's safety mechanisms flagged between 14 and 23\npercent of the manuscript as harmful, resulting in untranslated passages. These\nsafety settings, while effective in mitigating potential harm, hinder the\nmodel's ability to provide complete and accurate translations of historical\ntexts. Through real historical examples, this study highlights the inherent\nchallenges and limitations of current LLM safety implementations in the\nhandling of sensitive and context-rich materials. These real-world instances\nunderscore potential failures of LLMs in contemporary translation scenarios,\nwhere accurate and comprehensive translations are crucial-for example,\ntranslating the accounts of modern victims of war for legal proceedings or\nhumanitarian documentation.",

Existing federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, primarily based\non FedAvg, struggle with data heterogeneity, leading to harmful cross-client\ninterference and suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose\n\\textbf{FedALT}, a novel personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning algorithm that\nfundamentally departs from FedAvg. Instead of using an aggregated model to\ninitialize local training, each client continues training its individual LoRA\nwhile incorporating shared knowledge through a separate Rest-of-the-World\n(RoTW) LoRA component. To effectively balance local adaptation and global\ninformation, FedALT introduces an adaptive mixer that dynamically learns\ninput-specific weightings between the individual and RoTW LoRA components using\nthe Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) principle. Through extensive experiments on NLP\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that FedALT significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, achieving\nsuperior local adaptation without sacrificing computational efficiency.",

While current alignment\nstrategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated\ndatasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the \"safety mirage\"\nwhere supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations\nbetween superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than\nfostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious\ncorrelations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word\nmodification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries\nwith a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass\nsafeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over prudence,\ncausing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily. To address this\nissue, we show machine unlearning (MU) as a powerful alternative to supervised\nsafety fine-tuning as it avoids biased feature-label mappings and directly\nremoves harmful knowledge from VLMs while preserving their general\ncapabilities. Extensive evaluations across safety benchmarks show that under\none-word attacks, MU-based alignment reduces the attack success rate by up to\n60.17% and cuts unnecessary rejections by over 84.20%.

In this\npaper, we propose a zero-shot fully automatic framework that enables LMMs to\nreason through multiple chains of self-generated intermediate conceptual\ndiagrams, significantly enhancing their combinatorial planning capabilities.\nOur approach does not require any human initialization beyond a natural\nlanguage description of the task.

One common solution is to have a ``fallback layer''\nthat checks the planned trajectory for rule violations and replaces it with a\npre-defined safe action if necessary. Another approach involves adjusting the\nplanner's decisions to minimize a pre-defined ``cost function'' using\nadditional system predictions such as road layouts and detected obstacles.\nHowever, these pre-programmed rules or cost functions cannot learn and improve\nwith new training data, often resulting in overly conservative behaviors. In\nthis work, we propose Centaur (Cluster Entropy for Test-time trAining using\nUncertainty) which updates a planner's behavior via test-time training, without\nrelying on hand-engineered rules or cost functions. Instead, we measure and\nminimize the uncertainty in the planner's decisions. For this, we develop a\nnovel uncertainty measure, called Cluster Entropy, which is simple,\ninterpretable, and compatible with state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Using\ndata collected at prior test-time time-steps, we perform an update to the\nmodel's parameters using a gradient that minimizes the Cluster Entropy.

While recent\napproaches mitigate unsafe behaviors, their evaluation focuses on how safe the\nmodel is on unsafe inputs, ignoring potential shortcomings on safe ones. In\nthis paper, we first revise safety evaluation by introducing SafeGround, a new\nset of metrics that evaluate safety at different levels of granularity. With\nthis metric, we uncover a surprising issue of training-based methods: they make\nthe model less safe on safe inputs. From this finding, we take a different\ndirection and explore whether it is possible to make a model safer without\ntraining, introducing Unsafe Weights Manipulation (UWM). UWM uses a calibration\nset of safe and unsafe instances to compare activations between safe and unsafe\ncontent, identifying the most important parameters for processing the latter.\nTheir values are then manipulated via negation. Experiments show that UWM\nachieves the best tradeoff between safety and knowledge preservation,\nconsistently improving VLMs on unsafe queries while outperforming even\ntraining-based state-of-the-art methods on safe ones.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are used in chatbots or AI assistants to hold\nconversations with a human user. In such applications, the quality (e.g., user\nengagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly\nknown at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality,\nconversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a\nconversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing\nsimulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal\nresponse by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries\nat every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence\nimpractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach\ncalled Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE)\nthat exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform\nconversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic\ntransitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan\nentirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM\nresponse at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for\nsimulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times\nfaster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a\nwide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real\nworld, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

      "abstract": "Neural Audio Synthesis (NAS) models offer interactive musical control over\nhigh-quality, expressive audio generators. While these models can operate in\nreal-time, they often suffer from high latency, making them unsuitable for\nintimate musical interaction. The impact of architectural choices in deep\nlearning models on audio latency remains largely unexplored in the NAS\nliterature. In this work, we investigate the sources of latency and jitter\ntypically found in interactive NAS models. We then apply this analysis to the\ntask of timbre transfer using RAVE, a convolutional variational autoencoder for\naudio waveforms introduced by Caillon et al. in 2021. Finally, we present an\niterative design approach for optimizing latency. This culminates with a model\nwe call BRAVE (Bravely Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder), which is\nlow-latency and exhibits better pitch and loudness replication while showing\ntimbre modification capabilities similar to RAVE. We implement it in a\nspecialized inference framework for low-latency, real-time inference and\npresent a proof-of-concept audio plugin compatible with audio signals from\nmusical instruments. We expect the challenges and guidelines described in this\ndocument to support NAS researchers in designing models for low-latency\ninference from the ground up, enriching the landscape of possibilities for\nmusicians.",

      "abstract": "Conversational AI interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) are\nincreasingly used as coding assistants. However, questions remain about how\nprogrammers interact with LLM-based conversational agents, the challenges they\nencounter, and the factors influencing adoption. This study investigates\nprogrammers' usage patterns, perceptions, and interaction strategies when\nengaging with LLM-driven coding assistants. Through a survey, participants\nreported both the benefits, such as efficiency and clarity of explanations, and\nthe limitations, including inaccuracies, lack of contextual awareness, and\nconcerns about over-reliance. Notably, some programmers actively avoid LLMs due\nto a preference for independent learning, distrust in AI-generated code, and\nethical considerations. Based on our findings, we propose design guidelines for\nimproving conversational coding assistants, emphasizing context retention,\ntransparency, multimodal support, and adaptability to user preferences. These\ninsights contribute to the broader understanding of how LLM-based\nconversational agents can be effectively integrated into software development\nworkflows while addressing adoption barriers and enhancing usability.",

While randomized controlled trials and expert-led patient\ninterviews are standard methods for identifying these factors, they can be\ntime-consuming and infeasible. Causal discovery offers an alternative to\nconventional approaches by generating cause-and-effect hypotheses from\nobservational data. However, it often relies on strong or untestable\nassumptions, which can limit its practical application. This work aims to make\ncausal discovery more practical by considering multiple assumptions and\nidentifying heterogeneous effects. We formulate the problem of discovering\ncauses and effect modifiers of an outcome, where effect modifiers are contexts\n(e.g., age groups) with heterogeneous causal effects. Then, we present a novel,\nend-to-end framework that incorporates an ensemble of causal discovery\nalgorithms and estimation of heterogeneous effects to discover causes and\neffect modifiers that trigger or inhibit the outcome. We demonstrate that the\nensemble approach improves robustness by enhancing recall of causal factors\nwhile maintaining precision. Our study examines the causes of repeat emergency\nroom visits for diabetic patients and hospital readmissions for ICU patients.\nOur framework generates causal hypotheses consistent with existing literature\nand can help practitioners identify potential interventions and patient\nsubpopulations to focus on.",

To efficiently\ncompress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with\nattention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in\nsimply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their\nfeature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a\nMulti-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework\nand reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs\nfor different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by\nrandomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each\nnode in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by\nconsidering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated\nwith any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on\nmultiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and\nshow that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling\nmethod, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the\nencoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the\nkey to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less\nimportant according to domain knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse engineer neural networks by\nuncovering which high-level algorithms they implement. Causal abstraction\nprovides a precise notion of when a network implements an algorithm, i.e., a\ncausal model of the network contains low-level features that realize the\nhigh-level variables in a causal model of the algorithm. A typical problem in\npractical settings is that the algorithm is not an entirely faithful\nabstraction of the network, meaning it only partially captures the true\nreasoning process of a model. We propose a solution where we combine different\nsimple high-level models to produce a more faithful representation of the\nnetwork. Through learning this combination, we can model neural networks as\nbeing in different computational states depending on the input provided, which\nwe show is more accurate to GPT 2-small fine-tuned on two toy tasks. We observe\na trade-off between the strength of an interpretability hypothesis, which we\ndefine in terms of the number of inputs explained by the high-level models, and\nits faithfulness, which we define as the interchange intervention accuracy. Our\nmethod allows us to modulate between the two, providing the most accurate\ncombination of models that describe the behavior of a neural network given a\nfaithfulness level.",

Biography generation, as a specialized form of abstractive\nsummarization, plays a crucial role in historical research but faces unique\nchallenges that existing large language models (LLMs) struggle to address.\nThese challenges include maintaining stylistic adherence to historical writing\nconventions, ensuring factual fidelity, and handling fragmented information\nacross multiple documents. We present AIstorian, a novel end-to-end agentic\nsystem featured with a knowledge graph (KG)-powered retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and anti-hallucination multi-agents. Specifically, AIstorian\nintroduces an in-context learning based chunking strategy and a KG-based index\nfor accurate and efficient reference retrieval. Meanwhile, AIstorian\norchestrates multi-agents to conduct on-the-fly hallucination detection and\nerror-type-aware correction. Additionally, to teach LLMs a certain language\nstyle, we finetune LLMs based on a two-step training approach combining data\naugmentation-enhanced supervised fine-tuning with stylistic preference\noptimization. Extensive experiments on a real-life historical Jinshi dataset\ndemonstrate that AIstorian achieves a 3.8x improvement in factual accuracy and\na 47.6% reduction in hallucination rate compared to existing baselines.

The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use\nof many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian\ninference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable\nuncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work,\nwe propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly\nestimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single\nmodel, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place.\nOur method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks,\ngoverned by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of\nthe predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret\nthe computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with\nkernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate\npredictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make\nuse of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its\nuncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of\nout-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement\nlearning environments. We find that our single-model method performs\ncompetitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as\na reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe,\nposition contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable\nalternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and\ngeneral deep learning.",

This study aims to determine whether texture features are effective\nfor feature extraction in the pathological diagnosis of cardiomyopathy.\nFurthermore, model designs that contribute toward improving generalization\nperformance are examined by applying feature selection (FS) and dimensional\ncompression (DC) to several ML models. The obtained results were verified by\nvisualizing the inter-class distribution differences and conducting statistical\nhypothesis testing based on texture features. Additionally, they were evaluated\nusing predictive performance across different model designs with varying\ncombinations of FS and DC (applied or not) and decision boundaries. The\nobtained results confirmed that texture features may be effective for the\npathological diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Moreover, when the ratio of features\nto the sample size is high, a multi-step process involving FS and DC improved\nthe generalization performance, with the linear kernel support vector machine\nachieving the best results. This process was demonstrated to be potentially\neffective for models with reduced complexity, regardless of whether the\ndecision boundaries were linear, curved, perpendicular, or parallel to the\naxes.

There, RL agents consistently recover strategies closely\nresembling the sharp resetting distribution, known to be optimal in this\nscenario. We then extend the framework by allowing agents to control not only\nwhen to reset, but also their spatial dynamics through turning actions. In this\nmore complex setting, the agents discover strategies that adapt both resetting\nand turning to the properties of the environment, outperforming the proposed\nbenchmarks.

Although in\ncertain applications the FS algorithms can be seen to be successful, they have\nsimilar basic limitations. In all cases, the global feature selection\nalgorithms seek to select features that are relevant and common to all classes\nof the dataset. This is a major limitation since there could be features that\nare specifically useful for a particular class while irrelevant for other\nclasses, and full explanation of the relationship at class level therefore\ncannot be determined. While the inclusion of such features for all classes\ncould cause improved predictive ability for the relevant class, the same\nfeatures could be problematic for other classes.

The proposed method\ncarries out feature analysis at class level which enhances its ability to\nidentify relevant features for each class. Results from experiments indicate\nthat our method performs better than other methods, gives explainable results\nat class level, and has a low computational footprint when compared to other\nmethods.",

Existing studies on LLM self-knowledge\nhave been largely constrained by human-defined notions of feasibility, often\nneglecting the reasons behind unanswerability by LLMs and failing to study\ndeficient types of self-knowledge. This study aims to obtain intrinsic insights\ninto different types of LLM self-knowledge with a novel methodology: allowing\nthem the flexibility to set their own feasibility boundaries and then analysing\nthe consistency of these limits. We find that even frontier models like GPT-4o\nand Mistral Large are not sure of their own capabilities more than 80% of the\ntime, highlighting a significant lack of trustworthiness in responses. Our\nanalysis of confidence balance in LLMs indicates that models swing between\noverconfidence and conservatism in feasibility boundaries depending on task\ncategories and that the most significant self-knowledge weaknesses lie in\ntemporal awareness and contextual understanding. These difficulties in\ncontextual comprehension additionally lead models to question their operational\nboundaries, resulting in considerable confusion within the self-knowledge of\nLLMs. We make our code and results available publicly at\nhttps://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/LLM-Self_Knowledge_Eval",

Recently, the Tree-Sliced method has been\nintroduced to replace these lines with more intricate structures, known as tree\nsystems. This approach enhances the ability to capture topological information\nof integration domains in Sliced OT while maintaining low computational cost.\nInspired by this approach, in this paper, we present an adaptation of tree\nsystems on OT problems for measures supported on a sphere. As a counterpart to\nthe Radon transform variant on tree systems, we propose a novel spherical Radon\ntransform with a new integration domain called spherical trees. By leveraging\nthis transform and exploiting the spherical tree structures, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for OT problems on the sphere. Consequently, we obtain\nan efficient metric for measures on the sphere, named Spherical Tree-Sliced\nWasserstein (STSW) distance. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to\ndemonstrate the topology of spherical trees and the well-definedness and\ninjectivity of our Radon transform variant, which leads to an orthogonally\ninvariant distance between spherical measures.

      "abstract": "Accurate fine-grained geospatial scene classification using remote sensing\nimagery is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing\napproaches often rely on manually zooming remote sensing images at different\nscales to create typical scene samples. This approach fails to adequately\nsupport the fixed-resolution image interpretation requirements in real-world\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the Million-scale\nfinE-grained geospatial scEne classification dataseT (MEET), which contains\nover 1.03 million zoom-free remote sensing scene samples, manually annotated\ninto 80 fine-grained categories. In MEET, each scene sample follows a\nscene-inscene layout, where the central scene serves as the reference, and\nauxiliary scenes provide crucial spatial context for finegrained\nclassification. Moreover, to tackle the emerging challenge of scene-in-scene\nclassification, we present the Context-Aware Transformer (CAT), a model\nspecifically designed for this task, which adaptively fuses spatial context to\naccurately classify the scene samples. CAT adaptively fuses spatial context to\naccurately classify the scene samples by learning attentional features that\ncapture the relationships between the center and auxiliary scenes. Based on\nMEET, we establish a comprehensive benchmark for fine-grained geospatial scene\nclassification, evaluating CAT against 11 competitive baselines. The results\ndemonstrate that CAT significantly outperforms these baselines, achieving a\n1.88% higher balanced accuracy (BA) with the Swin-Large backbone, and a notable\n7.87% improvement with the Swin-Huge backbone. Further experiments validate the\neffectiveness of each module in CAT and show the practical applicability of CAT\nin the urban functional zone mapping.

We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its more\ndifficult extension, I-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer\nreasoning rules and ranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of\nvisual uncertainties on these nonverbal analogical reasoning tests, we extend\nthe I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a\ntwo-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce\nconfounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the\nprediction of the correct answer of the puzzles and 2) smoothen the\ndistributions of the input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in\nOpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to\njust 17.0% -- approaching random chance -- on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X,\nwhich increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty.\nThis drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens.

On the other hand, a\nneuro-symbolic probabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these\nout-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest\nreduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

This study introduces a\nmulti-stage generative upscaling framework leveraging Diffusion Models to\nenhance degraded images, transforming inputs as small as $64 \\times 64$ pixels\ninto high-fidelity $1024 \\times 1024$ outputs. By integrating an image-to-image\npipeline, ControlNet conditioning, and LoRA fine-tuning, our approach surpasses\ntraditional upscaling methods in restoring intricate textures and\ndomain-specific elements such as player details and jersey logos. The custom\nLoRA is trained on a custom football dataset, ensuring adaptability to sports\nbroadcast needs. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over\nconventional models, with ControlNet refining fine details and LoRA enhancing\ntask-specific elements.

      "abstract": "Large-scale pre-training of deep models, followed by fine-tuning them, has\nbecome the cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP). The prevalence of\ndata coupled with computational resources has led to large models with a\nconsiderable number of parameters. While the massive size of these models has\nled to remarkable success in many NLP tasks, a detriment is the expense\nrequired to retrain all the base model's parameters for the adaptation to each\ntask or domain. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides an effective\nsolution for this challenge by minimizing the number of parameters required to\nbe fine-tuned while maintaining the quality of the model. While existing\nmethods have achieved impressive results, they mainly focus on adapting a\nsubset of parameters, weight reparameterization, and prompt engineering. In\nthis paper, we study layers as extractors of different types of linguistic\ninformation that are valuable when used in conjunction. We then propose the\nMixture of Layer Experts (MoLEx), a novel sparse mixture of experts (SMoE)\nwhose experts are layers in the pre-trained model. It performs a conditional\ncomputation of a mixture of layers during fine-tuning to provide the model with\nmore structural knowledge about the data. By providing an avenue for\ninformation exchange between layers, MoLEx enables the model to make a more\nwell-informed prediction for the downstream task, leading to better fine-tuning\nresults with the same number of effective parameters. As experts can be\nprocessed in parallel, MoLEx introduces minimal additional computational\noverhead. We empirically corroborate the advantages of MoLEx when combined with\npopular PEFT baseline methods on a variety of downstream fine-tuning tasks,\nincluding the popular GLUE benchmark as well as the End-to-End Challenge (E2E).\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/rachtsy/molex.",

      "abstract": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language\nprocessing (NLP), yet the influence of prompt sentiment, a latent affective\ncharacteristic of input text, remains underexplored. This study systematically\nexamines how sentiment variations in prompts affect LLM-generated outputs in\nterms of coherence, factuality, and bias. Leveraging both lexicon-based and\ntransformer-based sentiment analysis methods, we categorize prompts and\nevaluate responses from five leading LLMs: Claude, DeepSeek, GPT-4, Gemini, and\nLLaMA. Our analysis spans six AI-driven applications, including content\ngeneration, conversational AI, legal and financial analysis, healthcare AI,\ncreative writing, and technical documentation. By transforming prompts, we\nassess their impact on output quality. Our findings reveal that prompt\nsentiment significantly influences model responses, with negative prompts often\nreducing factual accuracy and amplifying bias, while positive prompts tend to\nincrease verbosity and sentiment propagation. These results highlight the\nimportance of sentiment-aware prompt engineering for ensuring fair and reliable\nAI-generated content.",

While recent work has proposed decomposition-based interpretability\nmethods for identifying textual descriptions of attention heads in CLIP, the\nimplications of conceptual consistency in these text labels on interpretability\nand model performance has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we study the\nconceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like\nmodels. We conduct extensive experiments on six different models from OpenAI\nand OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. We\npropose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that\nmeasures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with\nspecific concepts. To assign concept labels to heads, we use in-context\nlearning with ChatGPT, guided by a few manually-curated examples, and validate\nthese labels using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Our soft-pruning experiments\nreveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as\npruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning\nrandom or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential\nconcepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific\nreasoning, and video-language understanding.

      "abstract": "In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the permutation\nproblem where the state space grows exponentially with the number of agents\nreduces sample efficiency. Additionally, many existing architectures struggle\nwith scalability, relying on a fixed structure tied to a specific number of\nagents, limiting their applicability to environments with a variable number of\nentities. While approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and\nself-attention mechanisms have progressed in addressing these challenges, they\nhave significant limitations as dense GNNs and self-attention mechanisms incur\nhigh computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nagent network and a non-linear mixing network that ensure\npermutation-equivariance and scalability, allowing them to generalize to\nenvironments with various numbers of agents. Our agent network significantly\nreduces computational complexity, and our scalable hypernetwork enables\nefficient weight generation for non-linear mixing. Additionally, we introduce\ncurriculum learning to improve training efficiency. Experiments on SMACv2 and\nGoogle Research Football (GRF) demonstrate that our approach achieves superior\nlearning performance compared to existing methods. By addressing both\npermutation-invariance and scalability in MARL, our work provides a more\nefficient and adaptable framework for cooperative MARL.

      "abstract": "To overcome computational challenges of Optimal Transport (OT), several\nvariants of Sliced Wasserstein (SW) has been developed in the literature. These\napproaches exploit the closed-form expression of the univariate OT by\nprojecting measures onto (one-dimensional) lines. However, projecting measures\nonto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information.\nTree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL) has emerged as a\npromising alternative that replaces these lines with a more advanced structure\ncalled tree systems. The tree structures enhance the ability to capture\ntopological information of the metric while preserving computational\nefficiency. However, at the core of TSW-SL, the splitting maps, which serve as\nthe mechanism for pushing forward measures onto tree systems, focus solely on\nthe position of the measure supports while disregarding the projecting domains.\nMoreover, the specific splitting map used in TSW-SL leads to a metric that is\nnot invariant under Euclidean transformations, a typically expected property\nfor OT on Euclidean space. In this work, we propose a novel class of splitting\nmaps that generalizes the existing one studied in TSW-SL enabling the use of\nall positional information from input measures, resulting in a novel\nDistance-based Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (Db-TSW) distance. In addition, we\nintroduce a simple tree sampling process better suited for Db-TSW, leading to\nan efficient GPU-friendly implementation for tree systems, similar to the\noriginal SW. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of proposed\nclass of splitting maps to verify the injectivity of the corresponding Radon\nTransform, and demonstrate that Db-TSW is an Euclidean invariant metric. We\nempirically show that Db-TSW significantly improves accuracy compared to recent\nSW variants while maintaining low computational cost via a wide range of\nexperiments.",

      "abstract": "Causal graphs are commonly used to understand and model complex systems.\nResearchers often construct these graphs from different perspectives, leading\nto significant variations for the same problem. Comparing causal graphs is,\ntherefore, essential for evaluating assumptions, integrating insights, and\nresolving disagreements. The rise of AI tools has further amplified this need,\nas they are increasingly used to generate hypothesized causal graphs by\nsynthesizing information from various sources such as prior research and\ncommunity inputs, providing the potential for automating and scaling causal\nmodeling for complex systems. Similar to humans, these tools also produce\ninconsistent results across platforms, versions, and iterations. Despite its\nimportance, research on causal graph comparison remains scarce. Existing\nmethods often focus solely on structural similarities, assuming identical\nvariable names, and fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships, which is\nessential for causal graph comparison. We address these gaps by investigating\nmethods for comparing causal graphs from both semantic and structural\nperspectives. First, we reviewed over 40 existing metrics and, based on\npredefined criteria, selected nine for evaluation from two threads of machine\nlearning: four semantic similarity metrics and five learning graph kernels. We\ndiscuss the usability of these metrics in simple examples to illustrate their\nstrengths and limitations. We then generated a synthetic dataset of 2,000\ncausal graphs using generative AI based on a reference diagram. Our findings\nreveal that each metric captures a different aspect of similarity, highlighting\nthe need to use multiple metrics.",

      "abstract": "Speech-driven 3D talking face method should offer both accurate lip\nsynchronization and controllable expressions. Previous methods solely adopt\ndiscrete emotion labels to globally control expressions throughout sequences\nwhile limiting flexible fine-grained facial control within the spatiotemporal\ndomain. We propose a diffusion-transformer-based 3D talking face generation\nmodel, Cafe-Talk, which simultaneously incorporates coarse- and fine-grained\nmultimodal control conditions. Nevertheless, the entanglement of multiple\nconditions challenges achieving satisfying performance. To disentangle speech\naudio and fine-grained conditions, we employ a two-stage training pipeline.\nSpecifically, Cafe-Talk is initially trained using only speech audio and\ncoarse-grained conditions. Then, a proposed fine-grained control adapter\ngradually adds fine-grained instructions represented by action units (AUs),\npreventing unfavorable speech-lip synchronization. To disentangle coarse- and\nfine-grained conditions, we design a swap-label training mechanism, which\nenables the dominance of the fine-grained conditions. We also devise a\nmask-based CFG technique to regulate the occurrence and intensity of\nfine-grained control. In addition, a text-based detector is introduced with\ntext-AU alignment to enable natural language user input and further support\nmultimodal control. Extensive experimental results prove that Cafe-Talk\nachieves state-of-the-art lip synchronization and expressiveness performance\nand receives wide acceptance in fine-grained control in user studies.

By abstractly learning from multiple\nsimulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's\napproaches aim to achieve abstract-to-real transfer for effective and rapid\nreal-world adaptation.

      "abstract": "Precision therapeutics require multimodal adaptive models that generate\npersonalized treatment recommendations. We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that\nleverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval\nacross a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications,\nand patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact\nat molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies\ncontraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications,\nand tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It\nretrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses\ninteractions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment\nrecommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task\nobjectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks\nthat require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse\nconsolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved\ndrugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent\noutperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new\nbenchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC,\ncovering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios.\nIt achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing\nGPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning.\nTxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions. By integrating\nmulti-step inference, real-time knowledge grounding, and tool-assisted\ndecision-making, TxAgent ensures that treatment recommendations align with\nestablished clinical guidelines and real-world evidence, reducing the risk of\nadverse events and improving therapeutic decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown notable potential in code generation\nfor optimization algorithms, unlocking exciting new opportunities. This paper\nexamines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve\nexisting ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this\npotential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains\n(metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to\nsolve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple\nmethodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over\nthe baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in\ncomputational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without\nrequiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic\nimplementation skills.",

      "abstract": "We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into\nwhether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language\nmodel with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model\nabout exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to\nexploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations\nthat the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate\nhighly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model\nto study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game\nwhere four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training,\ninvestigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams\nsuccessfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including\ninterpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and\ntraining data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of\neight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and\nlimitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment\naudits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for\npracticing and validating progress in alignment auditing.",

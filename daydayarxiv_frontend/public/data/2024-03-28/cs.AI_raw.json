    "abstract": "Fully-observable non-deterministic (FOND) planning is at the core of\nartificial intelligence planning with uncertainty. It models uncertainty\nthrough actions with non-deterministic effects. A* with Non-Determinism (AND*)\n(Messa and Pereira, 2023) is a FOND planner that generalizes A* (Hart et al.,\n1968) for FOND planning. It searches for a solution policy by performing an\nexplicit heuristic search on the policy space of the FOND task. In this paper,\nwe study and improve the performance of the policy-space search performed by\nAND*. We present a polynomial-time procedure that constructs a solution policy\ngiven just the set of states that should be mapped. This procedure, together\nwith a better understanding of the structure of FOND policies, allows us to\npresent three concepts of equivalences between policies. We use policy\nequivalences to prune part of the policy search space, making AND*\nsubstantially more effective in solving FOND tasks. We also study the impact of\ntaking into account structural state-space symmetries to strengthen the\ndetection of equivalence policies and the impact of performing the search with\nsatisficing techniques. We apply a recent technique from the group theory\nliterature to better compute structural state-space symmetries. Finally, we\npresent a solution compressor that, given a policy defined over complete\nstates, finds a policy that unambiguously represents it using the minimum\nnumber of partial states. AND* with the introduced techniques generates, on\naverage, two orders of magnitude fewer policies to solve FOND tasks. These\ntechniques allow explicit policy-space search to be competitive in terms of\nboth coverage and solution compactness with other state-of-the-art FOND\nplanners.",

Typically, TKGs contain complex geometric structures,\nwith various geometric structures interwoven. However, existing Temporal\nKnowledge Graph Completion (TKGC) methods either model TKGs in a single space\nor neglect the heterogeneity of different curvature spaces, thus constraining\ntheir capacity to capture these intricate geometric structures. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Integrating Multi-curvature shared and specific Embedding\n(IME) model for TKGC tasks. Concretely, IME models TKGs into multi-curvature\nspaces, including hyperspherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean spaces.\nSubsequently, IME incorporates two key properties, namely space-shared property\nand space-specific property. The space-shared property facilitates the learning\nof commonalities across different curvature spaces and alleviates the spatial\ngap caused by the heterogeneous nature of multi-curvature spaces, while the\nspace-specific property captures characteristic features. Meanwhile, IME\nproposes an Adjustable Multi-curvature Pooling (AMP) approach to effectively\nretain important information. Furthermore, IME innovatively designs similarity,\ndifference, and structure loss functions to attain the stated objective.\nExperimental results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of IME over\nexisting state-of-the-art TKGC models.",

This work delves into\nthe generation and utilization of synthetic images derived from text-to-image\ngenerative models in facilitating transfer learning paradigms. Despite the high\nvisual fidelity of the generated images, we observe that their naive\nincorporation into existing real-image datasets does not consistently enhance\nmodel performance due to the inherent distribution gap between synthetic and\nreal images.

    "abstract": "Most studies on machine learning in sensing systems focus on low-level\nperception tasks that process raw sensory data within a short time window.\nHowever, many practical applications, such as human routine modeling and\noccupancy tracking, require high-level reasoning abilities to comprehend\nconcepts and make inferences based on long-term sensor traces. Existing machine\nlearning-based approaches for handling such complex tasks struggle to\ngeneralize due to the limited training samples and the high dimensionality of\nsensor traces, necessitating the integration of human knowledge for designing\nfirst-principle models or logic reasoning methods. We pose a fundamental\nquestion: Can we harness the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to recognize complex events from long-term\nspatiotemporal sensor traces? To answer this question, we design an effective\nprompting framework for LLMs on high-level reasoning tasks, which can handle\ntraces from the raw sensor data as well as the low-level perception results. We\nalso design two strategies to enhance performance with long sensor traces,\nincluding summarization before reasoning and selective inclusion of historical\ntraces. Our framework can be implemented in an edge-cloud setup, running small\nLLMs on the edge for data summarization and performing high-level reasoning on\nthe cloud for privacy preservation. The results show that LLMSense can achieve\nover 80\\% accuracy on two high-level reasoning tasks such as dementia diagnosis\nwith behavior traces and occupancy tracking with environmental sensor traces.\nThis paper provides a few insights and guidelines for leveraging LLM for\nhigh-level reasoning on sensor traces and highlights several directions for\nfuture work.",

    "abstract": "Crop management plays a crucial role in determining crop yield, economic\nprofitability, and environmental sustainability. Despite the availability of\nmanagement guidelines, optimizing these practices remains a complex and\nmultifaceted challenge. In response, previous studies have explored using\nreinforcement learning with crop simulators, typically employing simple\nneural-network-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Building on this\nfoundation, this paper introduces a more advanced intelligent crop management\nsystem. This system uniquely combines RL, a language model (LM), and crop\nsimulations facilitated by the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\nTransfer (DSSAT). We utilize deep RL, specifically a deep Q-network, to train\nmanagement policies that process numerous state variables from the simulator as\nobservations. A novel aspect of our approach is the conversion of these state\nvariables into more informative language, facilitating the language model's\ncapacity to understand states and explore optimal management practices. The\nempirical results reveal that the LM exhibits superior learning capabilities.\nThrough simulation experiments with maize crops in Florida (US) and Zaragoza\n(Spain), the LM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under various\nevaluation metrics but also demonstrates a remarkable improvement of over 49\\%\nin economic profit, coupled with reduced environmental impact when compared to\nbaseline methods.

We explore specialized pre-training to\nadapt smaller LLMs to different healthcare datasets. Three methods are\nassessed: traditional masked language modeling, Deep Contrastive Learning for\nUnsupervised Textual Representations (DeCLUTR), and a novel pre-training\nobjective utilizing metadata categories from the healthcare settings. These\nschemes are evaluated on downstream document classification tasks for each\ndataset, with additional analysis of the resultant embedding spaces.\nContrastively trained models outperform other approaches on the classification\ntasks, delivering strong performance from limited labeled data and with fewer\nmodel parameter updates required. While metadata-based pre-training does not\nfurther improve classifications across the datasets, it yields interesting\nembedding cluster separability. All domain adapted LLMs outperform their\npublicly available general base LLM, validating the importance of\ndomain-specialization.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation)\nis a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad\napplications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to\ntime-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information\ninherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal\ndifferences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent\nlimitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nincorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task.\nTo this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv)\noperator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph\nconvolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating\nfrom traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and\noffer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals.\nBuilding upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural\nNetwork (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure.\nLikewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that\nincorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness\nregularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity\nto ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals,\nenhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on\nreal datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

However, extending such success to 3D\ndynamic human-object interaction (HOI) generation faces notable challenges,\nprimarily due to the lack of large-scale interaction data and comprehensive\ndescriptions that align with these interactions. This paper takes the\ninitiative and showcases the potential of generating human-object interactions\nwithout direct training on text-interaction pair data. Our key insight in\nachieving this is that interaction semantics and dynamics can be decoupled.\nBeing unable to learn interaction semantics through supervised training, we\ninstead leverage pre-trained large models, synergizing knowledge from a large\nlanguage model and a text-to-motion model. While such knowledge offers\nhigh-level control over interaction semantics, it cannot grasp the intricacies\nof low-level interaction dynamics. To overcome this issue, we further introduce\na world model designed to comprehend simple physics, modeling how human actions\ninfluence object motion. By integrating these components, our novel framework,\nInterDreamer, is able to generate text-aligned 3D HOI sequences in a zero-shot\nmanner.

    "abstract": "There is evidence that the driving style of an autonomous vehicle is\nimportant to increase the acceptance and trust of the passengers. The driving\nsituation has been found to have a significant influence on human driving\nbehavior. However, current driving style models only partially incorporate\ndriving environment information, limiting the alignment between an agent and\nthe given situation. Therefore, we propose a situation-aware driving style\nmodel based on different visual feature encoders pretrained on fleet data, as\nwell as driving behavior predictors, which are adapted to the driving style of\na specific driver. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms\nstatic driving styles significantly and forms plausible situation clusters.\nFurthermore, we found that feature encoders pretrained on our dataset lead to\nmore precise driving behavior modeling. In contrast, feature encoders\npretrained supervised and unsupervised on different data sources lead to more\nspecific situation clusters, which can be utilized to constrain and control the\ndriving style adaptation for specific situations. Moreover, in a real-world\nsetting, where driving style adaptation is happening iteratively, we found the\nMLP-based behavior predictors achieve good performance initially but suffer\nfrom catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, behavior predictors based on\nsituationdependent statistics can learn iteratively from continuous data\nstreams by design. Overall, our experiments show that important information for\ndriving behavior prediction is contained within the visual feature encoder.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we delve into several mechanisms employed by Transformer-based\nlanguage models (LLMs) for factual recall tasks. We outline a pipeline\nconsisting of three major steps: (1) Given a prompt ``The capital of France\nis,'' task-specific attention heads extract the topic token, such as\n``France,'' from the context and pass it to subsequent MLPs. (2) As attention\nheads' outputs are aggregated with equal weight and added to the residual\nstream, the subsequent MLP acts as an ``activation,'' which either erases or\namplifies the information originating from individual heads. As a result, the\ntopic token ``France'' stands out in the residual stream. (3) A deep MLP takes\n``France'' and generates a component that redirects the residual stream towards\nthe direction of the correct answer, i.e., ``Paris.'' This procedure is akin to\napplying an implicit function such as ``get\\_capital($X$),'' and the argument\n$X$ is the topic token information passed by attention heads. To achieve the\nabove quantitative and qualitative analysis for MLPs, we proposed a novel\nanalytic method aimed at decomposing the outputs of the MLP into components\nunderstandable by humans. Additionally, we observed a universal\nanti-overconfidence mechanism in the final layer of models, which suppresses\ncorrect predictions. We mitigate this suppression by leveraging our\ninterpretation to improve factual recall confidence. The above interpretations\nare evaluated across diverse tasks spanning various domains of factual\nknowledge, using various language models from the GPT-2 families, 1.3B OPT, up\nto 7B Llama-2, and in both zero- and few-shot setups.",

Even more recently, LLMs have been\nextended into multi-modal large language models (MM-LLMs) which extends their\ncapabilities to deal with image, video and audio information, in addition to\ntext. This opens up applications like text-to-video generation, image\ncaptioning, text-to-speech, and more and is achieved either by retro-fitting an\nLLM with multi-modal capabilities, or building a MM-LLM from scratch. This\npaper provides an extensive review of the current state of those LLMs with\nmulti-modal capabilities as well as the very recent MM-LLMs. It covers the\nhistorical development of LLMs especially the advances enabled by\ntransformer-based architectures like OpenAI's GPT series and Google's BERT, as\nwell as the role of attention mechanisms in enhancing model performance. The\npaper includes coverage of the major and most important of the LLMs and MM-LLMs\nand also covers the techniques of model tuning, including fine-tuning and\nprompt engineering, which tailor pre-trained models to specific tasks or\ndomains. Ethical considerations and challenges, such as data bias and model\nmisuse, are also analysed to underscore the importance of responsible AI\ndevelopment and deployment.

    "abstract": "The Space Domain Awareness (SDA) community routinely tracks satellites in\norbit by fitting an orbital state to observations made by the Space\nSurveillance Network (SSN). In order to fit such orbits, an accurate model of\nthe forces that are acting on the satellite is required. Over the past several\ndecades, high-quality, physics-based models have been developed for satellite\nstate estimation and propagation. These models are exceedingly good at\nestimating and propagating orbital states for non-maneuvering satellites;\nhowever, there are several classes of anomalous accelerations that a satellite\nmight experience which are not well-modeled, such as satellites that use\nlow-thrust electric propulsion to modify their orbit. Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs) are a valuable tool for these classes of satellites as they\ncombine physics models with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are highly\nexpressive and versatile function approximators. By combining a physics model\nwith a DNN, the machine learning model need not learn astrodynamics, which\nresults in more efficient and effective utilization of machine learning\nresources. This paper details the application of PINNs to estimate the orbital\nstate and a continuous, low-amplitude anomalous acceleration profile for\nsatellites. The PINN is trained to learn the unknown acceleration by minimizing\nthe mean square error of observations. We evaluate the performance of pure\nphysics models with PINNs in terms of their observation residuals and their\npropagation accuracy beyond the fit span of the observations. For a two-day\nsimulation of a GEO satellite using an unmodeled acceleration profile on the\norder of $10^{-8} \\text{ km/s}^2$, the PINN outperformed the best-fit physics\nmodel by orders of magnitude for both observation residuals (123 arcsec vs 1.00\narcsec) as well as propagation accuracy (3860 km vs 164 km after five days).",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly recognised as a viable computational\napproach for the automated optimisation of deep neural networks (DNNs) within\nartificial intelligence. This method extends to the training of DNNs, an\napproach known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is an inherently\nresource-intensive process, with certain studies reporting the consumption of\nthousands of GPU days for refining and training a single DNN network. To\naddress the computational challenges associated with neuroevolution while still\nattaining good DNN accuracy, surrogate models emerge as a pragmatic solution.\nDespite their potential, the integration of surrogate models into\nneuroevolution is still in its early stages, hindered by factors such as the\neffective use of high-dimensional data and the representation employed in\nneuroevolution. In this context, we address these challenges by employing a\nsuitable representation based on Linear Genetic Programming, denoted as\nNeuroLGP, and leveraging Kriging Partial Least Squares. The amalgamation of\nthese two techniques culminates in our proposed methodology known as the\nNeuroLGP-Surrogate Model (NeuroLGP-SM). For comparison purposes, we also code\nand use a baseline approach incorporating a repair mechanism, a common practice\nin neuroevolution. Notably, the baseline approach surpasses the renowned VGG-16\nmodel in accuracy. Given the computational intensity inherent in DNN\noperations, a singular run is typically the norm. To evaluate the efficacy of\nour proposed approach, we conducted 96 independent runs. Significantly, our\nmethodologies consistently outperform the baseline, with the SM model\ndemonstrating superior accuracy or comparable results to the NeuroLGP approach.\nNoteworthy is the additional advantage that the SM approach exhibits a 25%\nreduction in computational requirements, further emphasising its efficiency for\nneuroevolution.",

    "abstract": "Brain encoding with neuroimaging data is an established analysis aimed at\npredicting human brain activity directly from complex stimuli features such as\nmovie frames. Typically, these features are the latent space representation\nfrom an artificial neural network, and the stimuli are image, audio, or text\ninputs. Ridge regression is a popular prediction model for brain encoding due\nto its good out-of-sample generalization performance. However, training a ridge\nregression model can be highly time-consuming when dealing with large-scale\ndeep functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets that include many\nspace-time samples of brain activity. This paper evaluates different\nparallelization techniques to reduce the training time of brain encoding with\nridge regression on the CNeuroMod Friends dataset, one of the largest deep fMRI\nresource currently available. With multi-threading, our results show that the\nIntel Math Kernel Library (MKL) significantly outperforms the OpenBLAS library,\nbeing 1.9 times faster using 32 threads on a single machine. We then evaluated\nthe Dask multi-CPU implementation of ridge regression readily available in\nscikit-learn (MultiOutput), and we proposed a new \"batch\" version of Dask\nparallelization, motivated by a time complexity analysis. In line with our\ntheoretical analysis, MultiOutput parallelization was found to be impractical,\ni.e., slower than multi-threading on a single machine. In contrast, the\nBatch-MultiOutput regression scaled well across compute nodes and threads,\nproviding speed-ups of up to 33 times with 8 compute nodes and 32 threads\ncompared to a single-threaded scikit-learn execution. Batch parallelization\nusing Dask thus emerges as a scalable approach for brain encoding with ridge\nregression on high-performance computing systems using scikit-learn and large\nfMRI datasets.",

PTM could be\napplied to various scenarios, such as indoor/urban-canyon localization and\nscene retrieval. However, there exists no suitable and targeted dataset for PTM\nin practice. Therefore, we construct three new PTM benchmark datasets, namely\n3D2T-SR, 3D2T-NR, and 3D2T-QA. We observe that the data is challenging and with\nnoisy correspondence due to the sparsity, noise, or disorder of point clouds\nand the ambiguity, vagueness, or incompleteness of texts, which make existing\ncross-modal matching methods ineffective for PTM. To tackle these challenges,\nwe propose a PTM baseline, named Robust PointCloud-Text Matching method (RoMa).\nRoMa consists of two modules: a Dual Attention Perception module (DAP) and a\nRobust Negative Contrastive Learning module (RNCL). Specifically, DAP leverages\ntoken-level and feature-level attention to adaptively focus on useful local and\nglobal features, and aggregate them into common representations, thereby\nreducing the adverse impact of noise and ambiguity. To handle noisy\ncorrespondence, RNCL divides negative pairs, which are much less error-prone\nthan positive pairs, into clean and noisy subsets, and assigns them forward and\nreverse optimization directions respectively, thus enhancing robustness against\nnoisy correspondence. We conduct extensive experiments on our benchmarks and\ndemonstrate the superiority of our RoMa.",

As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is\ninadequate for training on billions of users and items. To break through the\nefficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical\nEncoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling.\nSpecifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples\nthe encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. Firstly, to\nprevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user\nbehaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extract\nembeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user\nsequences and stores them in the offline database. Subsequently, the deeper,\ntrainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions,\nthereby generating comprehensive user embeddings. This separation allows the\nlearning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level\nbehavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity. Finally,\nthese refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed\nitem embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores.\nExtensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory\nby five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences.\nBAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50\nmillion CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR\nprediction.",

The framework is flexible since each step can be used\nseparately with other models or treatment policies. The experiments on real\nlarge-scale networks indicate a clear advantage of our methodology over the\nstate of the art, which in many cases performs close to random, underlining the\nneed for models that can generalize with limited supervision to reduce\nexperimental risks.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective\napproach to aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences. RLHF\ncontains three steps, i.e., human preference collecting, reward learning, and\npolicy optimization, which are usually performed serially. Despite its\npopularity, however, (fixed) reward models may suffer from inaccurate\noff-distribution, since policy optimization continuously shifts LLMs' data\ndistribution. Repeatedly collecting new preference data from the latest LLMs\nmay alleviate this issue, which unfortunately makes the resulting system more\ncomplicated and difficult to optimize. In this paper, we propose reward\nlearning on policy (RLP), an unsupervised framework that refines a reward model\nusing policy samples to keep it on-distribution. Specifically, an unsupervised\nmulti-view learning method is introduced to learn robust representations of\npolicy samples. Meanwhile, a synthetic preference generation approach is\ndeveloped to simulate high-quality preference data with policy outputs.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that RLP consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art.

To solve the above problems, we construct the\nsocial media agent based on personalized knowledge and dynamic persona\ninformation. For personalized knowledge, we add external knowledge sources and\nmatch them with the persona information of agents, thereby giving the agent\npersonalized world knowledge. For dynamic persona information, we use current\naction information to internally retrieve the persona information of the agent,\nthereby reducing the interference of diverse persona information on the current\naction. To make the agent suitable for social media, we design five basic\nmodules for it: persona, planning, action, memory and reflection. To provide an\ninteraction and verification environment for the agent, we build a social media\nsimulation sandbox.

The economy of the nation depends heavily on agriculture. However,\nchoosing crops with better production rates and efficiently controlling crop\ndisease are obstacles that farmers have to face. These issues are addressed in\nthis research by utilizing machine learning methods and real-world datasets.\nThe recommended approach uses a variety of datasets on the production of crops,\nsoil conditions, agro-meteorological regions, crop disease, and meteorological\nfactors. These datasets offer insightful information on disease trends, soil\nnutrition demand of crops, and agricultural production history. By\nincorporating this knowledge, the model first recommends the list of primarily\nselected crops based on the soil nutrition of a particular user location. Then\nthe predictions of meteorological variables like temperature, rainfall, and\nhumidity are made using SARIMAX models. These weather predictions are then used\nto forecast the possibilities of diseases for the primary crops list by\nutilizing the support vector classifier. Finally, the developed model makes use\nof the decision tree regression model to forecast crop yield and provides a\nfinal crop list along with associated possible disease forecast. Utilizing the\noutcome of the model, farmers may choose the best productive crops as well as\nprevent crop diseases and reduce output losses by taking preventive actions.\nConsequently, planning and decision-making processes are supported and farmers\ncan predict possible crop yields. Overall, by offering a detailed decision\nsupport system for crop selection and disease prediction, this work can play a\nvital role in advancing agricultural practices in Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation presents the challenge of segmenting various-size\ntargets, demanding the model to effectively capture both local and global\ninformation. Despite recent efforts using CNNs and ViTs to predict annotations\nof different scales, these approaches often struggle to effectively balance the\ndetection of targets across varying sizes. Simply utilizing local information\nfrom CNNs and global relationships from ViTs without considering potential\nsignificant divergence in latent feature distributions may result in\nsubstantial information loss. To address this issue, in this paper, we will\nintroduce a novel Stagger Network (SNet) and argues that a well-designed fusion\nstructure can mitigate the divergence in latent feature distributions between\nCNNs and ViTs, thereby reducing information loss. Specifically, to emphasize\nboth global dependencies and local focus, we design a Parallel Module to bridge\nthe semantic gap. Meanwhile, we propose the Stagger Module, trying to fuse the\nselected features that are more semantically similar. An Information Recovery\nModule is further adopted to recover complementary information back to the\nnetwork. As a key contribution, we theoretically analyze that the proposed\nparallel and stagger strategies would lead to less information loss, thus\ncertifying the SNet's rationale. Experimental results clearly proved that the\nproposed SNet excels comparisons with recent SOTAs in segmenting on the Synapse\ndataset where targets are in various sizes. Besides, it also demonstrates\nsuperiority on the ACDC and the MoNuSeg datasets where targets are with more\nconsistent dimensions.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing concern about applying batch normalization (BN) in\nadversarial training (AT), especially when the model is trained on both\nadversarial samples and clean samples (termed Hybrid-AT). With the assumption\nthat adversarial and clean samples are from two different domains, a common\npractice in prior works is to adopt Dual BN, where BN and BN are used for\nadversarial and clean branches, respectively. A popular belief for motivating\nDual BN is that estimating normalization statistics of this mixture\ndistribution is challenging and thus disentangling it for normalization\nachieves stronger robustness. In contrast to this belief, we reveal that\ndisentangling statistics plays a less role than disentangling affine parameters\nin model training. This finding aligns with prior work (Rebuffi et al., 2023),\nand we build upon their research for further investigations. We demonstrate\nthat the domain gap between adversarial and clean samples is not very large,\nwhich is counter-intuitive considering the significant influence of adversarial\nperturbation on the model accuracy. We further propose a two-task hypothesis\nwhich serves as the empirical foundation and a unified framework for Hybrid-AT\nimprovement. We also investigate Dual BN in test-time and reveal that affine\nparameters characterize the robustness during inference. Overall, our work\nsheds new light on understanding the mechanism of Dual BN in Hybrid-AT and its\nunderlying justification.",

However, their widespread adoption is hindered by\nthe intensive computation required during the iterative denoising process.\nPost-training quantization (PTQ) presents a solution to accelerate sampling,\naibeit at the expense of sample quality, extremely in low-bit settings.\nAddressing this, our study introduces a unified Quantization Noise Correction\nScheme (QNCD), aimed at minishing quantization noise throughout the sampling\nprocess. We identify two primary quantization challenges: intra and inter\nquantization noise. Intra quantization noise, mainly exacerbated by embeddings\nin the resblock module, extends activation quantization ranges, increasing\ndisturbances in each single denosing step. Besides, inter quantization noise\nstems from cumulative quantization deviations across the entire denoising\nprocess, altering data distributions step-by-step. QNCD combats these through\nembedding-derived feature smoothing for eliminating intra quantization noise\nand an effective runtime noise estimatiation module for dynamicly filtering\ninter quantization noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms previous quantization methods for diffusion models, achieving\nlossless results in W4A8 and W8A8 quantization settings on ImageNet (LDM-4).\nCode is available at: https://github.com/huanpengchu/QNCD",

    "abstract": "In today's fast-paced industry, professionals face the challenge of\nsummarizing a large number of documents and extracting vital information from\nthem on a daily basis. These metrics are frequently hidden away in tables\nand/or their nested hyperlinks. To address this challenge, the approach of\nTable Question Answering (QA) has been developed to extract the relevant\ninformation. However, traditional Table QA training tasks that provide a table\nand an answer(s) from a gold cell coordinate(s) for a question may not always\nensure extracting the accurate answer(s). Recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for extracting information from\ntabular data using prompts. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-hop Few-shot\nOpen Rich Table QA (MFORT-QA) approach, which consists of two major steps. The\nfirst step involves Few-Shot Learning (FSL), where relevant tables and\nassociated contexts of hyperlinks are retrieved based on a given question. The\nretrieved content is then used to construct few-shot prompts as inputs to an\nLLM, such as ChatGPT. To tackle the challenge of answering complex questions,\nthe second step leverages Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to decompose the\ncomplex question into a sequential chain of questions and reasoning thoughts in\na multi-hop manner. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances this process\nby retrieving relevant tables and contexts of hyperlinks that are relevant to\nthe resulting reasoning thoughts and questions. These additional contexts are\nthen used to supplement the prompt used in the first step, resulting in more\naccurate answers from an LLM. Empirical results from OTT-QA demonstrate that\nour abstractive QA approach significantly improves the accuracy of extractive\nTable QA methods.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated\nnumerous benefits. However, hallucination is a significant concern. In\nresponse, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a highly\npromising paradigm to improve LLM outputs by grounding them in factual\ninformation. RAG relies on textual entailment (TE) or similar methods to check\nif the text produced by LLMs is supported or contradicted, compared to\nretrieved documents. This paper argues that conventional TE methods are\ninadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs. For\ninstance, consider a prompt about the 'USA's stance on the Ukraine war''. The\nAI-generated text states, ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not\nput troops in Ukraine...'' However, during the war the U.S. president is Joe\nBiden which contradicts factual reality. Moreover, current TE systems are\nunable to accurately annotate the given text and identify the exact portion\nthat is contradicted. To address this, we introduces a new type of TE called\n``Factual Entailment (FE).'', aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content\ngenerated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that\ncontradicts reality. We present FACTOID (FACTual enTAILment for hallucInation\nDetection), a benchmark dataset for FE. We propose a multi-task learning (MTL)\nframework for FE, incorporating state-of-the-art (SoTA) long text embeddings\nsuch as e5-mistral-7b-instruct, along with GPT-3, SpanBERT, and RoFormer. The\nproposed MTL architecture for FE achieves an avg. 40\\% improvement in accuracy\non the FACTOID benchmark compared to SoTA TE methods. As FE automatically\ndetects hallucinations, we assessed 15 modern LLMs and ranked them using our\nproposed Auto Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI_auto). This index\nquantifies and offers a comparative scale to evaluate and rank LLMs according\nto their hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of text-to-image models marks a significant milestone in the\nevolution of AI-generated images (AGIs), expanding their use in diverse domains\nlike design, entertainment, and more. Despite these breakthroughs, the quality\nof AGIs often remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for effective\nevaluation methods. These methods are crucial for assessing the quality of\nimages relative to their textual descriptions, and they must accurately mirror\nhuman perception. Substantial progress has been achieved in this domain, with\ninnovative techniques such as BLIP and DBCNN contributing significantly.\nHowever, recent studies, including AGIQA-3K, reveal a notable discrepancy\nbetween current methods and state-of-the-art (SOTA) standards. This gap\nemphasizes the necessity for a more sophisticated and precise evaluation\nmetric. In response, our objective is to develop a model that could give\nratings for metrics, which focuses on parameters like perceptual quality,\nauthenticity, and the correspondence between text and image, that more closely\naligns with human perception. In our paper, we introduce a range of effective\nmethods, including prompt designs and the Metric Transformer. The Metric\nTransformer is a novel structure inspired by the complex interrelationships\namong various AGI quality metrics.

    "abstract": "Optimizing the morphologies and the controllers that adapt to various tasks\nis a critical issue in the field of robot design, aka. embodied intelligence.\nPrevious works typically model it as a joint optimization problem and use\nsearch-based methods to find the optimal solution in the morphology space.\nHowever, they ignore the implicit knowledge of task-to-morphology mapping which\ncan directly inspire robot design. For example, flipping heavier boxes tends to\nrequire more muscular robot arms. This paper proposes a novel and general\ndifferentiable task-inspired framework for contact-aware robot design called\nTask2Morph. We abstract task features highly related to task performance and\nuse them to build a task-to-morphology mapping. Further, we embed the mapping\ninto a differentiable robot design process, where the gradient information is\nleveraged for both the mapping learning and the whole optimization. The\nexperiments are conducted on three scenarios, and the results validate that\nTask2Morph outperforms DiffHand, which lacks a task-inspired morphology module,\nin terms of efficiency and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning aims to learn representation that can be effectively\ngeneralized to downstream tasks. Many self-supervised approaches regard two\nviews of an image as both the input and the self-supervised signals, assuming\nthat either view contains the same task-relevant information and the shared\ninformation is (approximately) sufficient for predicting downstream tasks.\nRecent studies show that discarding superfluous information not shared between\nthe views can improve generalization. Hence, the ideal representation is\nsufficient for downstream tasks and contains minimal superfluous information,\ntermed minimal sufficient representation. One can learn this representation by\nmaximizing the mutual information between the representation and the supervised\nview while eliminating superfluous information. Nevertheless, the computation\nof mutual information is notoriously intractable. In this work, we propose an\nobjective termed multi-view entropy bottleneck (MVEB) to learn minimal\nsufficient representation effectively. MVEB simplifies the minimal sufficient\nlearning to maximizing both the agreement between the embeddings of two views\nand the differential entropy of the embedding distribution. Our experiments\nconfirm that MVEB significantly improves performance. For example, it achieves\ntop-1 accuracy of 76.9\\% on ImageNet with a vanilla ResNet-50 backbone on\nlinear evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the new\nstate-of-the-art result with ResNet-50.",

    "abstract": "Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is a new frontier of machine learning. By\nsqueezing deep learning models into billions of IoT devices and\nmicrocontrollers (MCUs), we expand the scope of AI applications and enable\nubiquitous intelligence.

There is also limited compiler\nand inference engine support for bare-metal devices. Therefore, we need to\nco-design the algorithm and system stack to enable TinyML. In this review, we\nwill first discuss the definition, challenges, and applications of TinyML. We\nthen survey the recent progress in TinyML and deep learning on MCUs. Next, we\nwill introduce MCUNet, showing how we can achieve ImageNet-scale AI\napplications on IoT devices with system-algorithm co-design. We will further\nextend the solution from inference to training and introduce tiny on-device\ntraining techniques.

    "abstract": "Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as an enabler for the energy-efficient\nand high-performance acceleration of deep learning (DL) workloads. Resistive\nrandom-access memory (ReRAM) is one of the most promising technologies to\nimplement PIM. However, as the complexity of Deep convolutional neural networks\n(DNNs) grows, we need to design a manycore architecture with multiple\nReRAM-based processing elements (PEs) on a single chip. Existing PIM-based\narchitectures mostly focus on computation while ignoring the role of\ncommunication. ReRAM-based tiled manycore architectures often involve many\nProcessing Elements (PEs), which need to be interconnected via an efficient\non-chip communication infrastructure. Simply allocating more resources (ReRAMs)\nto speed up only computation is ineffective if the communication infrastructure\ncannot keep up with it. In this paper, we highlight the design principles of a\ndataflow-aware PIM-enabled manycore platform tailor-made for various types of\nDL workloads.

    "abstract": "The astonishing development of single-photon cameras has created an\nunprecedented opportunity for scientific and industrial imaging. However, the\nhigh data throughput generated by these 1-bit sensors creates a significant\nbottleneck for low-power applications. In this paper, we explore the\npossibility of generating a color image from a single binary frame of a\nsingle-photon camera. We evidently find this problem being particularly\ndifficult to standard colorization approaches due to the substantial degree of\nexposure variation. The core innovation of our paper is an exposure synthesis\nmodel framed under a neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE) that\nallows us to generate a continuum of exposures from a single observation. This\ninnovation ensures consistent exposure in binary images that colorizers take\non, resulting in notably enhanced colorization. We demonstrate applications of\nthe method in single-image and burst colorization and show superior generative\nperformance over baselines.

    "abstract": "Machine learning tasks involving biomedical signals frequently grapple with\nissues such as limited data availability, imbalanced datasets, labeling\ncomplexities, and the interference of measurement noise. These challenges often\nhinder the optimal training of machine learning algorithms. Addressing these\nconcerns, we introduce BioDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic model\noptimized for the synthesis of multivariate biomedical signals. BioDiffusion\ndemonstrates excellence in producing high-fidelity, non-stationary,\nmultivariate signals for a range of tasks including unconditional,\nlabel-conditional, and signal-conditional generation. Leveraging these\nsynthesized signals offers a notable solution to the aforementioned challenges.\nOur research encompasses both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the\nsynthesized data quality, underscoring its capacity to bolster accuracy in\nmachine learning tasks tied to biomedical signals. Furthermore, when juxtaposed\nwith current leading time-series generative models, empirical evidence suggests\nthat BioDiffusion outperforms them in biomedical signal generation quality.",

We introduce a conditioning operation on\nStructural Causal Models (SCMs) to model latent selection from a causal\nperspective. We show that the conditioning operation transforms an SCM with the\npresence of an explicit latent selection mechanism into an SCM without such\nselection mechanism, which partially encodes the causal semantics of the\nselected subpopulation according to the original SCM. Furthermore, we show that\nthis conditioning operation preserves the simplicity, acyclicity, and linearity\nof SCMs, and commutes with marginalization. Thanks to these properties,\ncombined with marginalization and intervention, the conditioning operation\noffers a valuable tool for conducting causal reasoning tasks within causal\nmodels where latent details have been abstracted away. We demonstrate by\nexample how classical results of causal inference can be generalized to include\nselection bias and how the conditioning operation helps with modeling of\nreal-world problems.",

Synthetic data emerges as a potential\nremedy, offering robust privacy protection. However, prior LA research on\nsynthetic data lacks thorough evaluation, essential for assessing the delicate\nbalance between privacy and data utility.

We apply this evaluation to three distinct LA datasets,\nusing three different synthetic data generation methods. Our results show that\nsynthetic data can maintain similar utility (i.e., predictive performance) as\nreal data, while preserving privacy.

A factor contributing to this is the lack of datasets with diverse\ncrossing and non-crossing (C/NC) scenarios.

As an example, we use\nARCANE to generate a large and diverse dataset named PedSynth. We will show how\nPedSynth complements widely used real-world datasets such as JAAD and PIE, so\nenabling more accurate models for C/NC prediction. Considering the onboard\ndeployment of C/NC prediction models, we also propose a deep model named\nPedGNN, which is fast and has a very low memory footprint.

In this paper, we present the\nsurprising conclusion that current pretrained language models often generalize\nrelatively well from easy to hard data, even performing as well as oracle\nmodels finetuned on hard data. We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard\ngeneralization using simple finetuning methods like in-context learning, linear\nclassifier heads, and QLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness,\nincluding six empirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level)\nand one model-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one\ncares most about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect\neasy data rather than hard data for finetuning, since hard data is generally\nnoisier and costlier to collect. Our experiments use open models up to 70b in\nsize and four publicly available question-answering datasets with questions\nranging in difficulty from 3rd grade science questions to college level STEM\nquestions and general-knowledge trivia.

    "abstract": "This work addresses weight optimization problem for fully-connected\nfeed-forward neural networks. Unlike existing approaches that are based on\nback-propagation (BP) and chain rule gradient-based optimization (which implies\niterative execution, potentially burdensome and time-consuming in some cases),\nthe proposed approach offers the solution for weight optimization in\nclosed-form by means of least squares (LS) methodology. In the case where the\ninput-to-output mapping is injective, the new approach optimizes the weights in\na back-propagating fashion in a single iteration by jointly optimizing a set of\nweights in each layer for each neuron. In the case where the input-to-output\nmapping is not injective (e.g., in classification problems), the proposed\nsolution is easily adapted to obtain its final solution in a few iterations. An\nimportant advantage over the existing solutions is that these computations (for\nall neurons in a layer) are independent from each other; thus, they can be\ncarried out in parallel to optimize all weights in a given layer\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, its running time is deterministic in the sense\nthat one can obtain the exact number of computations necessary to optimize the\nweights in all network layers (per iteration, in the case of non-injective\nmapping). Our simulation and empirical results show that the proposed scheme,\nBPLS, works well and is competitive with existing ones in terms of accuracy,\nbut significantly surpasses them in terms of running time. To summarize, the\nnew method is straightforward to implement, is competitive and computationally\nmore efficient than the existing ones, and is well-tailored for parallel\nimplementation.",

    "abstract": "Feature removal is a central building block for eXplainable AI (XAI), both\nfor occlusion-based explanations (Shapley values) as well as their evaluation\n(pixel flipping, PF). However, occlusion strategies can vary significantly from\nsimple mean replacement up to inpainting with state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels. This ambiguity limits the usefulness of occlusion-based approaches. For\nexample, PF benchmarks lead to contradicting rankings. This is amplified by\ncompeting PF measures: Features are either removed starting with most\ninfluential first (MIF) or least influential first (LIF). This study proposes\ntwo complementary perspectives to resolve this disagreement problem. Firstly,\nwe address the common criticism of occlusion-based XAI, that artificial samples\nlead to unreliable model evaluations. We propose to measure the reliability by\nthe R(eference)-Out-of-Model-Scope (OMS) score. The R-OMS score enables a\nsystematic comparison of occlusion strategies and resolves the disagreement\nproblem by grouping consistent PF rankings. Secondly, we show that the\ninsightfulness of MIF and LIF is conversely dependent on the R-OMS score. To\nleverage this, we combine the MIF and LIF measures into the symmetric relevance\ngain (SRG) measure. This breaks the inherent connection to the underlying\nocclusion strategy and leads to consistent rankings. This resolves the\ndisagreement problem, which we verify for a set of 40 different occlusion\nstrategies.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a comprehensive hierarchical control framework for\nautonomous decision-making arising in robotics and autonomous systems. In a\ntypical hierarchical control architecture, high-level decision making is often\ncharacterised by discrete state and decision/control sets. However, a rational\ndecision is usually affected by not only the discrete states of the autonomous\nsystem, but also the underlying continuous dynamics even the evolution of its\noperational environment. This paper proposes a holistic and comprehensive\ndesign process and framework for this type of challenging problems, from new\nmodelling and design problem formulation to control design and stability\nanalysis. It addresses the intricate interplay between traditional continuous\nsystems dynamics utilized at the low levels for control design and discrete\nMarkov decision processes (MDP) for facilitating high-level decision making. We\nmodel the decision making system in complex environments as a hybrid system\nconsisting of a controlled MDP and autonomous (i.e. uncontrolled) continuous\ndynamics. Consequently, the new formulation is called as hybrid Markov decision\nprocess (HMDP). The design problem is formulated with a focus on ensuring both\nsafety and optimality while taking into account the influence of both the\ndiscrete and continuous state variables of different levels. With the help of\nthe model predictive control (MPC) concept, a decision maker design scheme is\nproposed for the proposed hybrid decision making model. By carefully designing\nkey ingredients involved in this scheme, it is shown that the recursive\nfeasibility and stability of the proposed autonomous decision making scheme are\nguaranteed. The proposed framework is applied to develop an autonomous lane\nchanging system for intelligent vehicles.",

    "abstract": "The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 prompted a massive uptake of\ngenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) across higher education institutions\n(HEIs). HEIs scrambled to respond to its use, especially by students, looking\nfirst to regulate it and then arguing for its productive integration within\nteaching and learning. In the year since the release, HEIs have increasingly\nprovided policies and guidelines to direct GenAI. In this paper we examined\ndocuments produced by 116 US universities categorized as high research activity\nor R1 institutions to comprehensively understand GenAI related advice and\nguidance given to institutional stakeholders. Through an extensive analysis, we\nfound the majority of universities (N=73, 63%) encourage the use of GenAI and\nmany provide detailed guidance for its use in the classroom (N=48, 41%). More\nthan half of all institutions provided sample syllabi (N=65, 56%) and half\n(N=58, 50%) provided sample GenAI curriculum and activities that would help\ninstructors integrate and leverage GenAI in their classroom. Notably, most\nguidance for activities focused on writing, whereas code and STEM-related\nactivities were mentioned half the time and vaguely even when they were (N=58,\n50%). Finally, more than one half of institutions talked about the ethics of\nGenAI on a range of topics broadly, including Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n(DEI) (N=60, 52%). Overall, based on our findings we caution that guidance for\nfaculty can become burdensome as extensive revision of pedagogical approaches\nis often recommended in the policies.",

Self-supervised learning (SSL) shows great potential in\nhandling this task, and some recent studies simultaneously learn multiple SSL\ntasks to further boost performance. Currently, different SSL tasks are assigned\nthe same set of weights for all graph nodes. However, we observe that some\ngraph nodes whose neighbors are in different groups require significantly\ndifferent emphases on SSL tasks. In this paper, we propose to dynamically learn\nthe weights of SSL tasks for different nodes and fuse the embeddings learned\nfrom different SSL tasks to boost performance. We design an innovative graph\nclustering approach, namely Dynamically Fusing Self-Supervised Learning\n(DyFSS). Specifically, DyFSS fuses features extracted from diverse SSL tasks\nusing distinct weights derived from a gating network. To effectively learn the\ngating network, we design a dual-level self-supervised strategy that\nincorporates pseudo labels and the graph structure. Extensive experiments on\nfive datasets show that DyFSS outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-task SSL\nmethods by up to 8.66% on the accuracy metric.

In this paper, we introduce\nML-On-Rails, a protocol designed to safeguard ML models, establish a\nwell-defined endpoint interface for different ML tasks, and clear communication\nbetween ML providers and ML consumers (software engineers). ML-On-Rails\nenhances the robustness of ML models via incorporating detection capabilities\nto identify unique challenges specific to production ML. We evaluated the\nML-On-Rails protocol through a real-world case study of the MoveReminder\napplication. Through this evaluation, we emphasize the importance of\nsafeguarding ML models in production.",

We designed the Attention-Points Network\nconsisting of two losses: Guided-Attention Loss (GALoss) and Box-Points Loss\n(BPLoss). GALoss uses an instance segmentation mask as ground-truth to learn\nthe attention features needed to improve the detection of small objects. These\nattention features are then used to predict box points for BPLoss, which\ndetermines the points' position relative to the target oriented bounding box.\nExperimental results show the effectiveness of our Attention-Points Network on\na standard oriented aerial dataset with small object instances (DOTA-v1.5) and\non a maritime-related dataset (HRSC2016).

We propose an open-source LLM-based AES system, inspired by the\ndual-process theory.

Furthermore, we conduct\nhuman-AI co-grading experiments with both novice and expert graders. We find\nthat our system not only automates the grading process but also enhances the\nperformance and efficiency of human graders, particularly for essays where the\nmodel has lower confidence.

Conformal prediction provides a\nmodel-agnostic framework for uncertainty quantification that can be applied to\nany dataset, irrespective of its distribution, post hoc. In contrast to other\npixel-level uncertainty quantification methods, conformal prediction operates\nwithout requiring access to the underlying model and training dataset,\nconcurrently offering statistically valid and informative prediction regions,\nall while maintaining computational efficiency. In response to the increased\nneed to report uncertainty alongside point predictions, we bring attention to\nthe promise of conformal prediction within the domain of Earth Observation (EO)\napplications. To accomplish this, we assess the current state of uncertainty\nquantification in the EO domain and found that only 20% of the reviewed Google\nEarth Engine (GEE) datasets incorporated a degree of uncertainty information,\nwith unreliable methods prevalent. Next, we introduce modules that seamlessly\nintegrate into existing GEE predictive modelling workflows and demonstrate the\napplication of these tools for datasets spanning local to global scales,\nincluding the Dynamic World and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)\ndatasets. These case studies encompass regression and classification tasks,\nfeaturing both traditional and deep learning-based workflows. Subsequently, we\ndiscuss the opportunities arising from the use of conformal prediction in EO.\nWe anticipate that the increased availability of easy-to-use implementations of\nconformal predictors, such as those provided here, will drive wider adoption of\nrigorous uncertainty quantification in EO, thereby enhancing the reliability of\nuses such as operational monitoring and decision making.",

Moreover, most previous methods only\nfocus on the single-view information of EEG signals, but ignore the information\nfrom other views which may further improve performance.

Then, an attention-based fusion module\nfuses the features of two views to obtain comprehensive discriminative features\nfor classification. Furthermore, a multi-view consistency loss is proposed to\nmaximize the feature similarity between two views of the same EEG signal.\nFinally, we propose a subject-specific adapter to rapidly transfer the\nknowledge of the model trained on data from existing subjects to decode data\nfrom new subjects.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to learn a compact student network using\nknowledge from a large pre-trained teacher network, where both networks are\ntrained on data from the same distribution. However, in practical applications,\nthe student network may be required to perform in a new scenario (i.e., the\ntarget domain), which usually exhibits significant differences from the known\nscenario of the teacher network (i.e., the source domain). The traditional\ndomain adaptation techniques can be integrated with KD in a two-stage process\nto bridge the domain gap, but the ultimate reliability of two-stage approaches\ntends to be limited due to the high computational consumption and the\nadditional errors accumulated from both stages. To solve this problem, we\npropose a new one-stage method dubbed ``Direct Distillation between Different\nDomains\" (4Ds). We first design a learnable adapter based on the Fourier\ntransform to separate the domain-invariant knowledge from the domain-specific\nknowledge. Then, we build a fusion-activation mechanism to transfer the\nvaluable domain-invariant knowledge to the student network, while\nsimultaneously encouraging the adapter within the teacher network to learn the\ndomain-specific knowledge of the target data. As a result, the teacher network\ncan effectively transfer categorical knowledge that aligns with the target\ndomain of the student network. Intensive experiments on various benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed 4Ds method successfully produces\nreliable student networks and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "While significant advancements have been made in the field of fair machine\nlearning, the majority of studies focus on scenarios where the decision model\noperates on a static population. In this paper, we study fairness in dynamic\nsystems where sequential decisions are made. Each decision may shift the\nunderlying distribution of features or user behavior. We model the dynamic\nsystem through a Markov Decision Process (MDP). By acknowledging that\ntraditional fairness notions and long-term fairness are distinct requirements\nthat may not necessarily align with one another, we propose an algorithmic\nframework to integrate various fairness considerations with reinforcement\nlearning using both pre-processing and in-processing approaches. Three case\nstudies show that our method can strike a balance between traditional fairness\nnotions, long-term fairness, and utility.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge in jailbreaking attacks has revealed significant\nvulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) when exposed to malicious\ninputs. While various defense strategies have been proposed to mitigate these\nthreats, there has been limited research into the underlying mechanisms that\nmake LLMs vulnerable to such attacks. In this study, we suggest that the\nself-safeguarding capability of LLMs is linked to specific activity patterns\nwithin their representation space. Although these patterns have little impact\non the semantic content of the generated text, they play a crucial role in\nshaping LLM behavior under jailbreaking attacks. Our findings demonstrate that\nthese patterns can be detected with just a few pairs of contrastive queries.\nExtensive experimentation shows that the robustness of LLMs against\njailbreaking can be manipulated by weakening or strengthening these patterns.\nFurther visual analysis provides additional evidence for our conclusions,\nproviding new insights into the jailbreaking phenomenon. These findings\nhighlight the importance of addressing the potential misuse of open-source LLMs\nwithin the community.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the semantic-aware paradigm presents opportunities for\ninnovative services, especially in the context of 6G-based applications.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in semantic extraction techniques,\nthe incorporation of semantic information into resource allocation\ndecision-making is still in its early stages, lacking consideration of the\nrequirements and characteristics of future systems. In response, this paper\nintroduces a novel formulation for the problem of multiple access to the\nwireless spectrum. It aims to optimize the utilization-fairness trade-off,\nusing the $\\alpha$-fairness metric, while accounting for user data correlation\nby introducing the concepts of self- and assisted throughputs. Initially, the\nproblem is analyzed to identify its optimal solution. Subsequently, a\nSemantic-Aware Multi-Agent Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (SAMA-D3QL)\ntechnique is proposed. This method is grounded in Model-free Multi-Agent Deep\nReinforcement Learning (MADRL), enabling the user equipment to autonomously\nmake decisions regarding wireless spectrum access based solely on their local\nindividual observations. The efficiency of the proposed technique is evaluated\nthrough two scenarios: single-channel and multi-channel. The findings\nillustrate that, across a spectrum of $\\alpha$ values, association matrices,\nand channels, SAMA-D3QL consistently outperforms alternative approaches. This\nestablishes it as a promising candidate for facilitating the realization of\nfuture federated, dynamically evolving applications.",

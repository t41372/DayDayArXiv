    "abstract": "Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.",

    "abstract": "Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface \"under-the-radar\" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.\n  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.",

    "abstract": "Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.",

There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL.

This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.",

Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.",

    "abstract": "Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.",

    "abstract": "To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.",

However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs.",

We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.",

    "abstract": "Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single \"best\" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.",

    "abstract": "Reconciling the tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains is a longstanding challenge in AI. We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds.",

Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments.",

Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.",

While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.",

    "abstract": "Temperature scaling is a simple method that allows to control the uncertainty of probabilistic models. It is mostly used in two contexts: improving the calibration of classifiers and tuning the stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model.",

StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.",

Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.",

This latter result is used to introduce a label-efficient propagation method that classifies large collections of responses from just 30-50 annotations, achieving F1 scores above 90%.\n  Our findings, framing hallucinations from a geometric perspective in the embedding space, complement traditional knowledge-centric and single-response evaluation paradigms, paving the way for further research.",

    "abstract": "The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.",

However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT.",

Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like \"universal\" and \"general-purpose\" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.",

This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.",

    "abstract": "Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.\n  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.\n  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.\n  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.",

We interpret this symmetry as a gauge redundancy and introduce gauge-adapted coordinates that separate invariant and scale-imbalance directions. Inspired by gauge fixing in field theory, we introduce a soft orbit-selection (norm-balancing) functional acting only on redundant scale coordinates. We show analytically that it induces dissipative relaxation of imbalance modes to preserve the realized function. In controlled experiments, this orbit-selection penalty expands the stable learning-rate regime and suppresses scale drift without changing expressivity. These results establish a structural link between gauge-orbit geometry and optimization conditioning, providing a concrete connection between gauge-theoretic concepts and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings.",

    "abstract": "As the capabilities of large language models continue to advance, so does their potential for misuse. While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.",

We introduce SynthSAEBench, a toolkit for generating large-scale synthetic data with realistic feature characteristics including correlation, hierarchy, and superposition, and a standardized benchmark model, SynthSAEBench-16k, enabling direct comparison of SAE architectures. Our benchmark reproduces several previously observed LLM SAE phenomena, including the disconnect between reconstruction and latent quality metrics, poor SAE probing results, and a precision-recall trade-off mediated by L0. We further use our benchmark to identify a new failure mode: Matching Pursuit SAEs exploit superposition noise to improve reconstruction without learning ground-truth features, suggesting that more expressive encoders can easily overfit. SynthSAEBench complements LLM benchmarks by providing ground-truth features and controlled ablations, enabling researchers to precisely diagnose SAE failure modes and validate architectural improvements before scaling to LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have achieved great success in producing high-quality samples, making them a central tool across machine learning applications. Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.",

Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement.",

In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate.",

It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \\emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \\emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice.",

Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines.",

Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server. This architecture enables low-latency event extraction at the edge and high-quality language reasoning in the cloud.

    "abstract": "Autonomous agentic systems are increasingly deployed in regulated, high-stakes domains where decisions may be irreversible and institutionally constrained. Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable.",

To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis.

The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering.

    "abstract": "AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Many real-world control problems, ranging from finance to robotics, evolve in continuous time with non-uniform, event-driven decisions. Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method.",

Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings. We demonstrate that this framework yields agent teams that adjust their size dynamically to match environmental demands.",

    "abstract": "Despite legal mandates for the right to be forgotten, AI operators routinely fail to comply with data deletion requests. While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse applications. Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms.",

Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.",

Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand.

    "abstract": "Safe and interpretable sequential decision-making is critical in healthcare, yet reinforcement learning (RL) policies for sepsis treatment optimization remain opaque and difficult to verify. Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment.",

To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.",

The framework incorporates contextual alignment, consistency checks, and majority agreement, followed by human evaluation to verify label quality. Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets. Our experiment reveal substantial variation across languages, reflecting language-dependent biases and inconsistent semantic preservation that directly affect the reliability of cross-lingual dataset reuse. Overall, this study highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-assisted dataset creation for low-resource IR.

To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities.

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) framework which extends the classical rate-distortion theory by incorporating the constraints on semantic distance, including both the traditional bit-wise distortion metric and statistical difference-based divergence metric, and complexity measure, adopted from the theory of minimum description length and information bottleneck. We derive the closed-form theoretical results of the minimum achievable rate under given constraints on semantic distance and complexity for both Gaussian and binary semantic sources. Our theoretical results show a fundamental three-way tradeoff among achievable rate, semantic distance, and model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and video datasets validate this tradeoff and further demonstrate that our information-theoretic complexity measure effectively correlates with practical computational costs, guiding efficient system design in resource-constrained scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Peer learning, where learners teach and learn from each other, is foundational to educational practice. A novel phenomenon has emerged: AI agents forming communities where they teach each other skills, share discoveries, and collaboratively build knowledge. This paper presents an educational data mining analysis of Moltbook, a large-scale community where over 2.4 million AI agents engage in peer learning, posting tutorials, answering questions, and sharing newly acquired skills. Analyzing 28,683 posts (after filtering automated spam) and 138 comment threads with statistical and qualitative methods, we find evidence of genuine peer learning behaviors: agents teach skills they built (74K comments on a skill tutorial), report discoveries, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Qualitative comment analysis reveals a taxonomy of peer response patterns: validation (22%), knowledge extension (18%), application (12%), and metacognitive reflection (7%), with agents building on each others' frameworks across multiple languages. We characterize how AI peer learning differs from human peer learning: (1) teaching (statements) dramatically outperforms help-seeking (questions) with an 11.4:1 ratio; (2) learning-oriented content (procedural and conceptual) receives 3x more engagement than other content; (3) extreme participation inequality reveals non-human behavioral signatures. We derive six design principles for educational AI, including leveraging validation-before-extension patterns and supporting multilingual learning networks. Our work provides the first empirical characterization of peer learning among AI agents, contributing to EDM's understanding of how learning occurs in increasingly AI-populated educational environments.",

In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain.",

In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $β$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $λ^*=(n-β)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior.",

To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations.",

While parameter synchronization guarantees numerical equivalence of model weights after each iteration, it does not necessarily imply alignment of worker-level optimization dynamics before gradient aggregation. This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \\emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \\texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \\texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves. These findings demonstrate that the proposed indicators provide actionable visibility into hidden instability modes in large-scale DP fine-tuning, enabling more reliable diagnosis and configuration assessment.",

As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities but incur high inference costs due to dense computation and memory access. Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed. Our research advances the limits of training-free approaches for efficient LLM inference, pushing the boundaries of achievable speedup without training.",

Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern deep learning, yet its core self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic computational complexity and lacks grounding in biological neural computation. We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers.",

    "abstract": "We present a system for autonomous book ideation that replaces human focus groups with synthetic reader panels -- diverse collections of LLM-instantiated reader personas that evaluate book concepts through structured tournament competitions. Each persona is defined by demographic attributes (age group, gender, income, education, reading level), behavioral patterns (books per year, genre preferences, discovery methods, price sensitivity), and consistency parameters. Panels are composed per imprint to reflect target demographics, with diversity constraints ensuring representation across age, reading level, and genre affinity. Book concepts compete in single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin, or Swiss-system tournaments, judged against weighted criteria including market appeal, originality, and execution potential. To reject low-quality LLM evaluations, we implement five automated anti-slop checks (repetitive phrasing, generic framing, circular reasoning, score clustering, audience mismatch). We report results from deployment within a multi-imprint publishing operation managing 6 active imprints and 609 titles in distribution. Three case studies -- a 270-evaluator panel for a children's literacy novel, and two 5-person expert panels for a military memoir and a naval strategy monograph -- demonstrate that synthetic panels produce actionable demographic segmentation, identify structural content issues invisible to homogeneous reviewers, and enable tournament filtering that eliminates low-quality concepts while enriching high-quality survivors from 15% to 62% of the evaluated pool.",

We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is one of the most widely used techniques to improve generalization in modern machine learning, often justified by its ability to promote invariance to label-irrelevant transformations. However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal methods are widely used in rice deterioration detection, which exhibit limited capability in representing and extracting fine-grained abnormal features. Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces.",

Federated Learning FL mitigates this by keeping data on-device, but vanilla FL struggles under VLNs' extreme cross-client heterogeneity in environments and instruction styles, making a single global model suboptimal. This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.",

VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a widely used framework for reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks by retrieving relevant documents from a database to support accurate responses. However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff.",

Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.",

The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model.",

We supplemented the overall results with representative case studies and summarized the commonalities of these cases, analyzing the security vulnerabilities and typical failure modes that Clawdbot is prone to trigger in practice.",

The researcher observed design and evaluation activities and conducted interviews with both developers and domain experts. Analysis revealed four key practices: creating workarounds for data collection, turning to augmentation when expert input was limited, co-developing evaluation criteria with experts, and adopting hybrid expert-developer-LLM evaluation strategies. These practices show how teams made strategic decisions under constraints and demonstrate the central role of domain expertise in shaping the system. Challenges included expert motivation and trust, difficulties structuring participatory design, and questions around ownership and integration of expert knowledge.

Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2).

    "abstract": "Vulnerability detection tools are widely adopted in software projects, yet they often overwhelm maintainers with false positives and non-actionable reports. Automated exploitation systems can help validate these reports; however, existing approaches typically operate in isolation from detection pipelines, failing to leverage readily available metadata such as vulnerability type and source-code location. In this paper, we investigate how reported security vulnerabilities can be assessed in a realistic grey-box exploitation setting that leverages minimal vulnerability metadata, specifically a CWE classification and a vulnerable code location. We introduce Agentic eXploit Engine (AXE), a multi-agent framework for Web application exploitation that maps lightweight detection metadata to concrete exploits through decoupled planning, code exploration, and dynamic execution feedback. Evaluated on the CVE-Bench dataset, AXE achieves a 30% exploitation success rate, a 3x improvement over state-of-the-art black-box baselines. Even in a single-agent configuration, grey-box metadata yields a 1.75x performance gain. Systematic error analysis shows that most failed attempts arise from specific reasoning gaps, including misinterpreted vulnerability semantics and unmet execution preconditions. For successful exploits, AXE produces actionable, reproducible proof-of-concept artifacts, demonstrating its utility in streamlining Web vulnerability triage and remediation. We further evaluate AXE's generalizability through a case study on a recent real-world vulnerability not included in CVE-Bench.",

    "abstract": "We study instruction following in multi-task reinforcement learning, where an agent must zero-shot execute novel tasks not seen during training. In this setting, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently been adopted as a powerful framework for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks. While existing approaches successfully train generalist policies, they often struggle to effectively capture the rich logical and temporal structure inherent in LTL specifications. In this work, we address these concerns with a novel approach to learn structured task representations that facilitate training and generalisation. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of Boolean formulae constructed from a finite automaton of the task. We propose a hierarchical neural architecture to encode the logical structure of these formulae, and introduce an attention mechanism that enables the policy to reason about future subgoals. Experiments in a variety of complex environments demonstrate the strong generalisation capabilities and superior performance of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a central role in large language model (LLM) post-training. Among existing approaches, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely used, especially for RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning. In GRPO, each query prompts the LLM to generate a group of rollouts with a fixed group size $N$. When all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, either all correct or all incorrect, the group-normalized advantages become zero, yielding no gradient signal and wasting fine-tuning compute. We introduce Adaptive Efficient Rollout Optimization (AERO), an enhancement of GRPO. AERO uses an adaptive rollout strategy, applies selective rejection to strategically prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones. Across three model configurations (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), AERO improves compute efficiency without sacrificing performance. Under the same total rollout budget, AERO reduces total training compute by about 48% while shortening wall-clock time per step by about 45% on average. Despite the substantial reduction in compute, AERO matches or improves Pass@8 and Avg@8 over GRPO, demonstrating a practical, scalable, and compute-efficient strategy for RL-based LLM alignment.",

    "abstract": "Coalition formation concerns strategic collaborations of selfish agents that form coalitions based on their preferences. It is often assumed that coalitions are disjoint and preferences are fully known, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we thus present a new model of coalition formation with possibly overlapping coalitions under partial information, where selfish agents may be part of multiple coalitions simultaneously and their full preferences are initially unknown. Instead, information about past interactions and associated utility feedback is stored in a fixed offline dataset, and we aim to efficiently infer the agents' preferences from this dataset. We analyze the impact of diverse dataset information constraints by studying two types of utility feedback that can be stored in the dataset: agent- and coalition-level utility feedback. For both feedback models, we identify assumptions under which the dataset covers sufficient information for an offline learning algorithm to infer preferences and use them to recover a partition that is (approximately) Nash stable, in which no agent can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating. Our additional goal is devising algorithms with low sample complexity, requiring only a small dataset to obtain a desired approximation to Nash stability. Under agent-level feedback, we provide a sample-efficient algorithm proven to obtain an approximately Nash stable partition under a sufficient and necessary assumption on the information covered by the dataset. However, under coalition-level feedback, we show that only under a stricter assumption is sufficient for sample-efficient learning. Still, in multiple cases, our algorithms' sample complexity bounds have optimality guarantees up to logarithmic factors. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm converges to a low approximation level to Nash stability across diverse settings.",

If benchmarking becomes infeasible, our ability to measure any progress in AI is at stake. We refer to this scenario as the post-comprehension regime. In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators.",

    "abstract": "Recent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) such as Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE are transforming generative AI in natural language processing. However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%.",

Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies.",

However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: collecting interaction trajectories from real-world websites is expensive and difficult to verify. The underlying state transitions are hidden, leading to reliance on inconsistent and costly external verifiers to evaluate step-level correctness. To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites. Unlike real websites, where state transitions are implicit, AutoWebWorld explicitly defines all states, actions, and transition rules. This enables programmatic verification: action correctness is checked against predefined rules, and task success is confirmed by reaching a goal state in the FSM graph. AutoWebWorld enables a fully automated search-and-verify pipeline, generating over 11,663 verified trajectories from 29 diverse web environments at only $0.04 per trajectory. Training on this synthetic data significantly boosts real-world performance. Our 7B Web GUI agent outperforms all baselines within 15 steps on WebVoyager. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling law: as the synthetic data volume increases, performance on WebVoyager and Online-Mind2Web consistently improves.",

This allows an orchestrating agent to invoke quantitative predictions when needed and reason about their outputs in context. Unlike conventional pipelines that treat ML inference as a static preprocessing step, MLAT positions the model as a first-class tool alongside web search, database queries, and APIs, enabling the LLM to decide when and how to use it based on conversational context.\n  To validate MLAT, we present PitchCraft, a pilot production system that converts discovery call recordings into professional proposals with ML-predicted pricing. The system uses two agents: a Research Agent that gathers prospect intelligence via parallel tool calls, and a Draft Agent that invokes an XGBoost pricing model as a tool call and generates a complete proposal through structured outputs. The pricing model, trained on 70 examples combining real and human-verified synthetic data, achieves R^2 = 0.807 on held-out data with a mean absolute error of 3688 USD. The system reduces proposal generation time from multiple hours to under 10 minutes.\n  We describe the MLAT framework, structured output architecture, training methodology under extreme data scarcity, and sensitivity analysis demonstrating meaningful learned relationships.

Traditional compilers are constrained by fixed heuristics, whereas finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be expensive.

We propose KernelBlaster, a Memory-Augmented In-context Reinforcement Learning (MAIC-RL) framework designed to improve CUDA optimization search capabilities of LLM-based GPU coding agents. KernelBlaster enables agents to learn from experience and make systematically informed decisions on future tasks by accumulating knowledge into a retrievable Persistent CUDA Knowledge Base. We propose a novel profile-guided, textual-gradient-based agentic flow for CUDA generation and optimization to achieve high performance across generations of GPU architectures. KernelBlaster guides LLM agents to systematically explore high-potential optimization strategies beyond naive rewrites.

In parallel, research on automated and AI-assisted peer review has proliferated. Despite this momentum, empirical progress remains constrained by several critical limitations in existing datasets. While reviewers routinely evaluate figures, tables, and complex layouts to assess scientific claims, most existing datasets remain overwhelmingly text-centric. This bias is reinforced by a narrow focus on data from computer science venues. Furthermore, these datasets lack precise alignment between reviewer comments and specific manuscript versions, obscuring the iterative relationship between peer review and manuscript evolution. In response, we introduce FMMD, a multimodal and multidisciplinary open peer review dataset curated from F1000Research. The dataset bridges the current gap by integrating manuscript-level visual and structural data with version-specific reviewer reports and editorial decisions. By providing explicit alignment between reviewer comments and the exact article iteration under review, FMMD enables fine-grained analysis of the peer review lifecycle across diverse scientific domains. FMMD supports tasks such as multimodal issue detection and multimodal review comment generation. It provides a comprehensive empirical resource for the development of peer review research.",

To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.",

This paper introduces reverse n-wise output testing, a mathematically principled paradigm inversion that constructs covering arrays directly over domain-specific output equivalence classes, ML confidence calibration buckets, decision boundary regions, fairness partitions, embedding clusters, ranking stability bands, quantum measurement outcome distributions (0-dominant, 1-dominant, superposition collapse), error syndrome patterns (bit-flip, phase-flip, correlated errors), then solves the computationally challenging black-box inverse mapping problem via gradient-free metaheuristic optimization to synthesize input feature configurations or quantum circuit parameters capable of eliciting targeted behavioral signatures from opaque models. The framework delivers synergistic benefits across both domains: explicit customer-centric prediction/measurement coverage guarantees, substantial improvements in fault detection rates for ML calibration/boundary failures and quantum error syndromes, enhanced test suite efficiency, and structured MLOps/quantum validation pipelines with automated partition discovery from uncertainty analysis and coverage drift monitoring.",

We argue that this sycophancy poses a unique epistemic risk to how individuals come to see the world: unlike hallucinations that introduce falsehoods, sycophancy distorts reality by returning responses that are biased to reinforce existing beliefs. We provide a rational analysis of this phenomenon, showing that when a Bayesian agent is provided with data that are sampled based on a current hypothesis the agent becomes increasingly confident about that hypothesis but does not make any progress towards the truth. We test this prediction using a modified Wason 2-4-6 rule discovery task where participants (N=557) interacted with AI agents providing different types of feedback. Unmodified LLM behavior suppressed discovery and inflated confidence comparably to explicitly sycophantic prompting. By contrast, unbiased sampling from the true distribution yielded discovery rates five times higher. These results reveal how sycophantic AI distorts belief, manufacturing certainty where there should be doubt.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid increase in residential heat pump (HP) installations, optimizing hot water production in households is essential, yet it faces major technical and scalability challenges. Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste. However, the conventional approach of training separate machine learning models for each household becomes computationally expensive at scale, particularly in cloud-connected HP deployments.\n  This study introduces DELTAiF, a transfer learning (TL) based framework that provides scalable and accurate prediction of household hot water consumption. By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale.",

Current benchmarks, however, are largely restricted to idealized simulations, failing to address the practical demands of specialized domains like advertising and marketing analytics. In these fields, tasks are inherently more complex, often requiring multi-round interaction with professional marketing tools. To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms. AD-Bench is constructed from real user marketing analysis requests, with domain experts providing verifiable reference answers and corresponding reference tool-call trajectories. The benchmark categorizes requests into three difficulty levels (L1-L3) to evaluate agents' capabilities under multi-round, multi-tool collaboration. Experiments show that on AD-Bench, Gemini-3-Pro achieves Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but performance drops significantly on L3 to Pass@1 = 49.4% and Pass@3 = 62.1%, with a trajectory coverage of 70.1%, indicating that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit substantial capability gaps in complex advertising and marketing analysis scenarios. AD-Bench provides a realistic benchmark for evaluating and improving advertising marketing agents, the leaderboard and code can be found at https://github.com/Emanual20/adbench-leaderboard.",

Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.",

    "abstract": "Tabular anomaly detection is often handled by single detectors or static ensembles, even though strong performance on tabular data typically comes from heterogeneous model families (e.g., tree ensembles, deep tabular networks, and tabular foundation models) that frequently disagree under distribution shift, missingness, and rare-anomaly regimes. We propose MAD, a Multi-Agent Debating framework that treats this disagreement as a first-class signal and resolves it through a mathematically grounded coordination layer. Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator. We establish regret guarantees for the synthesized losses and show how conformal calibration can wrap the debated score to control false positives under exchangeability. Experiments on diverse tabular anomaly benchmarks show improved robustness over baselines and clearer traces of model disagreement",

Conventional heuristic methods and deep learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically designed for static graphs and thus struggle to capture temporal dependencies. Snapshot-based techniques partially address this issue but often encounter data sparsity and class imbalance, particularly in networks with transient interactions such as telecommunication call detail records (CDRs). Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information. Experiments on a sparse CDR dataset show that our approach increases average precision by 2.6% over standard TGNs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating local topology for robust link prediction in dynamic networks.",

To facilitate standardized evaluation, we contribute the Touch2Add benchmark for this interactive task. Our extensive evaluations, where our placement model significantly outperforms both random placement and general-purpose VLM baselines, confirm the framework's ability to produce high-fidelity edits. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between initial placement accuracy and final edit quality, validating our decoupled approach.

We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.",

The central bottleneck lies in the extreme sparsity of highquality search trajectories and reward signals, arising from the difficulty of scalable longhorizon task construction and the high cost of interactionheavy rollouts involving external tool calls. To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks. (2) We introduce toolaugmented queries to encourage proactive tool use rather than passive recall.(3) During midtraining, we strengthen core atomic capabilities knowledge, planning, and function calling substantially reducing the cost of collecting highquality trajectories for downstream training. (4) We build a local simulated environment that enables rapid, lowcost algorithmic iteration for reinforcement learning experiments. Across both textonly and multimodal searchagent benchmarks, our approach achieves stateoftheart performance. To facilitate future research on longhorizon search agents, we will release 10K highquality complex text search trajectories, 5K multimodal trajectories and 1K text RL query set, and together with code and model checkpoints.",

Finance-specific biases can inflate performance, contaminate backtests, and make reported results useless for any deployment claim. We identify five recurring biases in financial LLM applications. They include look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, narrative bias, objective bias, and cost bias. These biases break financial tasks in distinct ways and they often compound to create an illusion of validity. We reviewed 164 papers from 2023 to 2025 and found that no single bias is discussed in more than 28 percent of studies. This position paper argues that bias in financial LLM systems requires explicit attention and that structural validity should be enforced before any result is used to support a deployment claim.

Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations.

While Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using zoom-in tools offers a path forward, we find that standard reinforcement learning struggles to navigate these vast visual spaces without structured domain priors. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between post-training paradigms: comparing Cold-start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR, and Agentic RLVR on the UHR RS benchmark.Our controlled studies yield a counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is a primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains. Despite lacking images, domain-specific text injects the concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval.Based on this, we propose a staged knowledge injection recipe: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures;and (2) \"pre-warming\" on the same hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize and amplify subsequent tool-based RL. This approach achieves a 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, significantly outperforming larger general purpose models (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Intern-S1) and establishing a new state-of-the-art.",

The performance of RLMs with different parameter sizes (255B, 32B, 4B) was compared against human validated data. Two expert human reviewers (EHRs) independently classified a weighted random sample of reports. Results: The largest RLM achieved the highest accuracy (89%), outperforming the initial approach (80%). Classification accuracy was higher for mothers (93%) than for fathers (85%), and EHRs exhibited similar differences. Conclusions: RLMs' reasoning can effectively assess complex case factors such as parental cooperation. Lower accuracy in assessing fathers' cooperation supports the argument of a stronger professional focus on mothers in CPS interventions.",

This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. In practice, naive injections often fail because the malicious intent is too explicit or drifts too far from the original skill, leading agents to ignore or refuse them; existing attacks are also largely hand-crafted. We propose the first automated framework for stealthy prompt injection tailored to agent skills. The framework forms a closed loop with three agents: an Attack Agent that synthesizes injection skills under explicit stealth constraints, a Code Agent that executes tasks using the injected skills in a realistic tool environment, and an Evaluate Agent that logs action traces (e.g., tool calls and file operations) and verifies whether targeted malicious behaviors occurred. We also propose a malicious payload hiding strategy that conceals adversarial operations in auxiliary scripts while injecting optimized inducement prompts to trigger tool execution. Extensive experiments across diverse coding-agent settings and real-world software engineering tasks show that our method consistently achieves high attack success rates under realistic settings.",

    "abstract": "The \"thinking-with-images\" paradigm enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to actively explore visual scenes via zoom-in tools. This is essential for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing VQA, where task-relevant cues are sparse and tiny. However, we observe a consistent failure mode in existing zoom-enabled MLLMs: Tool Usage Homogenization, where tool calls collapse into task-agnostic patterns, limiting effective evidence acquisition. To address this, we propose GeoEyes, a staged training framework consisting of (1) a cold-start SFT dataset, UHR Chain-of-Zoom (UHR-CoZ), which covers diverse zooming regimes, and (2) an agentic reinforcement learning method, AdaZoom-GRPO, that explicitly rewards evidence gain and answer improvement during zoom interactions. The resulting model learns on-demand zooming with proper stopping behavior and achieves substantial improvements on UHR remote sensing benchmarks, with 54.23% accuracy on XLRS-Bench.",

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly used to answer and verify scientific claims, yet existing evaluations typically assume that a model must always produce a definitive answer. In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

    "abstract": "With the significant expansion of the context window in Large Language Models (LLMs), these models are theoretically capable of processing millions of tokens in a single pass. However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the \"lost in the middle\" problem has been largely resolved in newer models. This study emphasizes the gap between the theoretical capacity and the actual performance of models on complex, high-volume data tasks and highlights the importance of metrics beyond simple accuracy for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06).

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.",

Existing methods face notable limitations: GRPO samples exclusively from the root, saturating high-probability trajectories while leaving deep, error-prone states under-explored. Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO, tree-based methods, and other strong baselines.",

While recent LLM multi-agent systems (MAS) show promise, they largely optimise for outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards. One critical real-world case of this is gene-disease validity curation, where experts must determine whether a gene is causally implicated in a disease by synthesising diverse biomedical evidence. We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our evaluation on the ClinGen dataset shows that with outcome-only rewards, MAS with a GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent substantially improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 with a base model supervisor to 0.732, but results in poor process alignment (0.392 F1). Conversely, with process + outcome rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI.",

Accurate, reliable detection of chestnuts on the orchard floor is crucial for developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology. However, developing a reliable chestnut detection system faces challenges in complex environments with shading, varying natural light conditions, and interference from weeds, fallen leaves, stones, and other foreign on-ground objects, which have remained unaddressed. This study collected 319 images of chestnuts on the orchard floor, containing 6524 annotated chestnuts. A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment.

However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the \"ForesightSafety Bench\" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks.

This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and contextually appropriate text; however, their capacity to produce genuinely creative outputs remains limited. This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments.",

    "abstract": "Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) promise flexible 6G network access through disaggregated, software-driven components and open interfaces, but this programmability also increases operational complexity. Multiple control loops coexist across the service management layer and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), while independently developed control applications can interact in unintended ways. In parallel, recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling a shift from isolated AI models toward agentic AI systems that can interpret goals, coordinate multiple models and control functions, and adapt their behavior over time. This article proposes a multi-scale agentic AI framework for O-RAN that organizes RAN intelligence as a coordinated hierarchy across the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT), Near-Real-Time (Near-RT), and Real-Time (RT) control loops: (i) A Large Language Model (LLM) agent in the Non-RT RIC translates operator intent into policies and governs model lifecycles. (ii) Small Language Model (SLM) agents in the Near-RT RIC execute low-latency optimization and can activate, tune, or disable existing control applications; and (iii) Wireless Physical-layer Foundation Model (WPFM) agents near the distributed unit provide fast inference close to the air interface. We describe how these agents cooperate through standardized O-RAN interfaces and telemetry. Using a proof-of-concept implementation built on open-source models, software, and datasets, we demonstrate the proposed agentic approach in two representative scenarios: robust operation under non-stationary conditions and intent-driven slice resource control.",

    "abstract": "The most valuable asset of any cloud-based organization is data, which is increasingly exposed to sophisticated cyberattacks. Until recently, the implementation of security measures in DevOps environments was often considered optional by many government entities and critical national services operating in the cloud. This includes systems managing sensitive information, such as electoral processes or military operations, which have historically been valuable targets for cybercriminals. Resistance to security implementation is often driven by concerns over losing agility in software development, increasing the risk of accumulated vulnerabilities. Nowadays, patching software is no longer enough; adopting a proactive cyber defense strategy, supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), is crucial to anticipating and mitigating threats. Thus, this work proposes integrating the Security Chaos Engineering (SCE) methodology with a new LLM-based flow to automate the creation of attack defense trees that represent adversary behavior and facilitate the construction of SCE experiments based on these graphical models, enabling teams to stay one step ahead of attackers and implement previously unconsidered defenses.

To illustrate its application, we focus on material classification: high-resolution Digit tactile readings are processed by a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate local material predictions, which are then embedded into an augmented signed distance field (SDF) network that jointly predicts geometry and continuous material regions. Experimental results show that the system achieves a high correspondence between predicted and actual materials on both single- and multi-material objects, with an average matching accuracy of 79.87% across multiple manipulation trials on a multi-material object.",

We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language table reasoning, where there are two main categories of methods. Prompt-based approaches rely on language-only inference or one-pass program generation without step-level verification. Agent-based approaches use tools in a closed loop, but verification is often local and backtracking is limited, allowing errors to propagate and increasing cost. Moreover, they rely on chain- or beam-style trajectories that are typically combinatorially redundant, leading to high token costs. In this paper, we propose TabTracer, an agentic framework that coordinates multi-step tool calls over intermediate table states, with explicit state tracking for verification and rollback. First, it enforces step-level verification with typed operations and lightweight numeric and format checks to provide reliable rewards and suppress hallucinations. Second, execution-feedback Monte Carlo Tree Search maintains a search tree of candidate table states and uses backpropagated reflection scores to guide UCB1 selection and rollback via versioned snapshots. Third, it reduces redundancy with budget-aware pruning, deduplication, and state hashing with a monotonicity gate to cut token cost. Comprehensive evaluation on TabFact, WikiTQ, and CRT datasets shows that TabTracer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 6.7% in accuracy while reducing token consumption by 59--84%.",

While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode.",

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models.",

Distinct from reasoning steps that prioritize internal self-derivation, a reasoning-pivot serves as an atomic unit (node or edge) in the reasoning chain that emphasizes knowledge linkage, and it typically relies on external evidence to complete the reasoning. Supported by our constructed REAL-VQA dataset, our approach integrates Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train a generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and employs Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD), an intra-model decoding strategy that leverages these pivots for targeted conflict mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our pivot-driven resolution paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is a core component of intelligent transportation systems, supporting various downstream tasks such as signal control and network-level traffic management. In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

LLM-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for this task by leveraging human-like social questionnaire responses to model group behaviors. Existing LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on group-level values at discrete time points, treating them as static snapshots rather than dynamic processes. However, group-level values are not fixed but shaped by long-term social changes. Modeling their dynamics is thus crucial for accurate social evolution prediction--a key challenge in both data mining and social science. This problem remains underexplored due to limited longitudinal data, group heterogeneity, and intricate historical event impacts.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for group-level dynamic social simulation by integrating historical value trajectories into LLM-based human response modeling. We select China and the U.S. as representative contexts, conducting stratified simulations across four core sociodemographic dimensions (gender, age, education, income). Using the World Values Survey, we construct a multi-wave, group-level longitudinal dataset to capture historical value evolution, and then propose the first event-based prediction method for this task, unifying social events, current value states, and group attributes into a single framework. Evaluations across five LLM families show substantial gains: a maximum 30.88\\% improvement on seen questions and 33.97\\% on unseen questions over the Vanilla baseline. We further find notable cross-group heterogeneity: U.S. groups are more volatile than Chinese groups, and younger groups in both countries are more sensitive to external changes. These findings advance LLM-based social simulation and provide new insights for social scientists to understand and predict social value changes.",

    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

    "abstract": "We present BitDance, a scalable autoregressive (AR) image generator that predicts binary visual tokens instead of codebook indices. With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

However, existing agent memory systems suffer from two key gaps: they rely on a one-size-fits-all memory structure and do not model memory structure selection as a context-adaptive decision, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous interaction patterns and resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds. Experiments on two long-horizon benchmarks, PERSONAMEM and LoCoMo, demonstrate that our method achieves average improvements of 9.18% and 6.14%.",

In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency. Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets highlight the bottlenecks of existing LLM-based methods and demonstrate the superiority of FloCA.

In this work, we introduce EIDOS, a foundation model family that shifts pretraining from future value prediction to latent-space predictive learning. We train a causal Transformer to predict the evolution of latent representations, encouraging the emergence of structured and temporally coherent latent states. To ensure stable targets for latent-space learning, we design a lightweight aggregation branch to construct target representations. EIDOS is optimized via a joint objective that integrates latent-space alignment, observational grounding to anchor representations to the input signal, and direct forecasting supervision. On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS mitigates structural fragmentation in the representation space and achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results demonstrate that constraining models to learn predictable latent dynamics is a principled step toward more robust and reliable time series foundation models.",

    "abstract": "The integration of LLMs into vulnerability detection (VD) has shifted the field toward interpretable and context-aware analysis. While post-training methods have shown promise in general coding tasks, their systematic application to VD remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the post-training pipeline for LLM-based VD, spanning from cold-start SFT to off-policy preference optimization and on-policy RL, uncovering how data curation, stage interactions, reward mechanisms, and evaluation protocols collectively dictate the efficacy of model training and assessment. Our study identifies practical guidelines and insights: (1) SFT based on rejection sampling greatly outperforms rationalization-based supervision, which can introduce hallucinations due to ground-truth leakage. (2) While increased SFT epochs constantly benefit preference optimization, excessive SFT inhibits self-exploration during RL, ultimately limiting performance gains. (3) Coarse-grained reward signals often mislead RL, whereas fine-grained root-cause judgments ensure reliable credit assignment. Specification-based rewards offer further benefits but incur significant effort in specification generation. (4) Although filtering extremely hard-to-detect vulnerability samples improves RL training efficiency, the cost of performance loss should be considered in practical applications. (5) Models trained under GRPO significantly outperform those using SFT and preference optimization (i.e., DPO and ORPO), as well as a series of zero-shot SOTA LLMs, underscoring the significant potential of on-policy RL for LLM-based VD. (6) In contrast to binary matching that tends to overestimate performance, LLM-as-a-Judge based on root-cause analysis provides a more robust evaluation protocol, although its accuracy varies across judge models with different levels of security expertise.",

Here, we present LitePath, a deployment-friendly foundational framework designed to mitigate model over-parameterization and patch level redundancy. LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.",

    "abstract": "The large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) show strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and multi-modal understanding, and can enable advanced capabilities in low-altitude edge intelligence. However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.",

Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation.

    "abstract": "Providing extensive context via prompting is vital for leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\\% in F1 score and 40.7\\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\\%.",

Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.",

    "abstract": "Recommendation systems are essential for personalizing e-commerce shopping experiences. Among these, Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR) has emerged as a key scenario, which utilizes a trigger item (explicitly represents a user's instantaneous interest), enabling precise, real-time recommendations. Although several trigger-based techniques have been proposed, most of them struggle to address the intent myopia issue, that is, a recommendation system overemphasizes the role of trigger items and narrowly focuses on suggesting commodities that are highly relevant to trigger items. Meanwhile, existing methods rely on collaborative behavior patterns between trigger and recommended items to identify the user's preferences, yet the sparsity of ID-based interaction restricts their effectiveness. To this end, we propose the Deep Adaptive Intent-Aware Network (DAIAN) that dynamically adapts to users' intent preferences. In general, we first extract the users' personalized intent representations by analyzing the correlation between a user's click and the trigger item, and accordingly retrieve the user's related historical behaviors to mine the user's diverse intent. Besides, sparse collaborative behaviors constrain the performance in capturing items associated with user intent. Hence, we reinforce similarity by leveraging a hybrid enhancer with ID and semantic information, followed by adaptive selection based on varying intents. Experimental results on public datasets and our industrial e-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAIAN.",

In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category. The memory data structure largely determines the attainable quality frontier, while aggressive compression and generative integration mechanisms mostly shift cost between insertion and retrieval with limited accuracy gain.",

To address this gap, we develop NP-specific chemical language models (NPCLMs) by pre-training state-space models (Mamba and Mamba-2) and comparing them with transformer baselines (GPT). Using a dataset of about 1M NPs, we present the first systematic comparison of selective state-space models and transformers for NP-focused tasks, together with eight tokenization strategies including character-level, Atom-in-SMILES (AIS), byte-pair encoding (BPE), and NP-specific BPE. We evaluate molecule generation (validity, uniqueness, novelty) and property prediction (membrane permeability, taste, anti-cancer activity) using MCC and AUC-ROC. Mamba generates 1-2 percent more valid and unique molecules than Mamba-2 and GPT, with fewer long-range dependency errors, while GPT yields slightly more novel structures. For property prediction, Mamba variants outperform GPT by 0.02-0.04 MCC under random splits, while scaffold splits show comparable performance. Results demonstrate that domain-specific pre-training on about 1M NPs can match models trained on datasets over 100 times larger.",

To further enhance paralinguistic reasoning, we introduce DataFlux, a closed loop audio instruction data synthesis and verification pipeline that constructs high quality, logically consistent supervision from raw audio. Extensive evaluations across ASR, knowledge reasoning, safety, instruction following, and paralinguistic benchmarks, demonstrate that Eureka-Audio achieves an efficient balance between computational cost and performance.

In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement.",

Prior work has shown promising results at scale in bringing this compression step inside the LLMs' architecture with heuristics to draw token boundaries, and also attempts to learn these token boundaries with straight-through estimates, which treat the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries as a continuous one. We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss. We observe that techniques from reinforcement learning, such as time discounting, are necessary to reduce the variance of this score function sufficiently to make it practicable. We demonstrate that the resultant method outperforms prior proposed straight-through estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively at the $100$ million parameter scale.",

Empirical evidence shows that no forecasting model is universally dominant and that relative rankings vary across error metrics, demand regimes, and forecast horizons, generating ambiguity in multi-SKU decision contexts. This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection. The findings demonstrate that model selection in heterogeneous demand environments cannot be treated as a static ranking problem, and that horizon-consistent, structurally adaptive mechanisms provide a principled, operationally coherent solution for multi-SKU forecasting.",

However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries.

Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: memory compression risks losing critical details required for complex reasoning, while retaining raw text introduces unnecessary computational overhead for simple queries. The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations. HyMem adopts a dual-granular storage scheme paired with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, while an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. Experiments show that HyMem achieves strong performance on both the LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context while reducing computational cost by 92.6\\%, establishing a state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.",

LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is a classical framework for analyzing the generalization error of learning algorithms. It predicts that an algorithm has small generalization error if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the training set such as the removal or replacement of a training point. While stability has been demonstrated for numerous well-known algorithms, this framework has had limited success in analyses of deep neural networks. In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization.",

However, CoT reasoning may exhibit failure modes that we note as pathologies, which prevent it from being useful for monitoring. Prior work has identified three distinct pathologies: post-hoc rationalization, where models generate plausible explanations backwards from predetermined answers; encoded reasoning, where intermediate steps conceal information within seemingly interpretable text; and internalized reasoning, where models replace explicit reasoning with meaningless filler tokens while computing internally. To better understand and discriminate between these pathologies, we create a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic. To validate our approach, we develop model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies. Our work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring.",

We evaluate RPGD on three large-scale public 3D HPE datasets as well as on a self-collected in-the-wild dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that RPGD consistently recovers extrinsic parameters with accuracy comparable to the provided ground truth, achieving sub-pixel MPJPE reprojection error even in challenging, noisy settings. These results indicate that RPGD provides a practical and automatic solution for reliable extrinsic calibration of large-scale 3D HPE dataset collection.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in speech language models, such as GPT-4o Voice Mode and Gemini Live, have demonstrated promising speech generation capabilities. Nevertheless, the aesthetic naturalness of the synthesized audio still lags behind that of human speech. Enhancing generation quality requires a reliable evaluator of speech naturalness. However, existing naturalness evaluators typically regress raw audio to scalar scores, offering limited interpretability of the evaluation and moreover fail to generalize to speech across different taxonomies. Inspired by recent advances in generative reward modeling, we propose the Generative Speech Reward Model (GSRM), a reasoning-centric reward model tailored for speech. The GSRM is trained to decompose speech naturalness evaluation into an interpretable acoustic feature extraction stage followed by feature-grounded chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling explainable judgments. To achieve this, we curated a large-scale human feedback dataset comprising 31k expert ratings and an out-of-domain benchmark of real-world user-assistant speech interactions. Experiments show that GSRM substantially outperforms existing speech naturalness predictors, achieving model-human correlation of naturalness score prediction that approaches human inter-rater consistency. We further show how GSRM can improve the naturalness of speech LLM generations by serving as an effective verifier for online RLHF.",

However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted.

We introduce Ambient Physics, a framework for learning the joint distribution of coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations, without requiring a single complete observation. The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish \"truly unobserved\" from \"artificially unobserved\", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Compared with prior diffusion-based methods, it achieves a 62.51$\\%$ reduction in average overall error while using 125$\\times$ fewer function evaluations. We also identify a \"one-point transition\": masking a single already-observed point enables learning from partial observations across architectures and measurement patterns. Ambient Physics thus enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable.",

However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks.",

This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.",

Meanwhile, organizations underuse historical A/B results and rich content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration. We present a unified framework to (i) prioritize which variants to test, (ii) explain why winners win, and (iii) surface targeted opportunities for new, higher-potential variants. Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity. For better interpretability and understanding, we project treatments onto curated semantic marketing attributes and re-express the ranker in this space via a sign-consistent, sparse constrained Lasso, yielding per-attribute coefficients and signed contributions for visual explanations, top-k drivers, and natural-language insights. We then compute an opportunity index combining attribute importance (from the ranker) with under-expression in the current experiment to flag missing, high-impact attributes. Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \\textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers.

Many SBI problems involve posteriors constrained by structured domains, such as bounded physical parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables, yet standard flow-matching methods typically operate in unconstrained spaces. This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in flexible information extraction, their ability to produce precisely structured tables remains insufficiently understood, particularly for indirect extraction that requires complex capabilities such as reasoning and conflict resolution. Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction.We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables. Based on this approach, we present DTBench, a synthetic benchmark that adopts a proposed two-level taxonomy of Doc2Table capabilities, covering 5 major categories and 13 subcategories. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs on DTBench, and demonstrate substantial performance gaps across models, as well as persistent challenges in reasoning, faithfulness, and conflict resolution. DTBench provides a comprehensive testbed for data generation and evaluation, facilitating future research on Doc2Table extraction.

While flow-based policies have recently proven effective in modeling complex action distributions with a fast deterministic sampling process, they still face a trade-off between expressiveness and computational burden, which is typically controlled by the number of flow steps. In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness. Empirically, our MVP achieves state-of-the-art success rates across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks from Robomimic and OGBench.

    "abstract": "We present an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts from natural-language specifications. The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies. This provides a reproducible benchmark for empirical research on smart contract synthesis quality and supports extensions to formal verification and compliance checking.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Large language models spend most of their inference cost on attention over long contexts, yet empirical behavior suggests that only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query. We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-Ω(Δ/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.\n  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies.",

Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.",

We introduce MechPert, a lightweight framework that encourages LLM agents to generate directed regulatory hypotheses rather than relying solely on functional similarity. Multiple agents independently propose candidate regulators with associated confidence scores; these are aggregated through a consensus mechanism that filters spurious associations, producing weighted neighborhoods for downstream prediction. We evaluate MechPert on Perturb-seq benchmarks across four human cell lines. For perturbation prediction in low-data regimes ($N=50$ observed perturbations), MechPert improves Pearson correlation by up to 10.5\\% over similarity-based baselines.

    "abstract": "Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks-including traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, and multiple knapsack problems-as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings.

We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding. Under this setting, Qwen2.5-VL-3B model finetuned on OmniScience show substantial gains over baselines, achieving a gain of 0.378 on MM-MT-Bench and a gain of 0.140 on MMMU.",

We here address three critical challenges in the current SOTA solution: insufficient retrieval granularity, vulnerability to environmental noise, and prohibitive efficiency-performance gap. Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods. Extensive offline benchmarks and online A/B tests on Alibaba e-commerce platform confirm that Pailitao-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers substantial business impact.

But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \\textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \\emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \\textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\\footnote{\\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.",

However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.",

    "abstract": "Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) excel at perception but struggle with complex reasoning requiring precise acoustic measurements. While external tools can extract fine-grained features like exact tempo or pitch, effective integration remains challenging: naively using all tools causes information overload, while prompt-based selection fails to assess context-dependent utility. To address this, we propose AuTAgent (Audio Tool Agent), a reinforcement learning framework that learns when and which tools to invoke. By employing a sparse-feedback training strategy with a novel Differential Reward mechanism, the agent learns to filter out irrelevant tools and invokes external assistance only when it yields a net performance gain over the base model. Experimental results confirm that AuTAgent complements the representation bottleneck of LALMs by providing verifiable acoustic evidence. It improves accuracy by 4.20% / 6.20% and 9.80% / 8.00% for open-source and closed-source backbones on the MMAU Test-mini and the MMAR benchmarks, respectively. In addition, further experiments demonstrate exceptional transferability. We highlight the complementary role of external tools in augmenting audio model reasoning.",

We initiate the study of \\emph{sparsification--approximation trade-offs} for CC, asking how much edge information is needed to retain LP-based guarantees. We establish a structural dichotomy between pseudometric and general weighted instances.

This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183. This study could contribute to the efficiency of waste sorting at Material Recovery Facility, facilitating better raw material acquisition for recycling with minimal human intervention and enhancing the overall throughput.",

    "abstract": "Current Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on explaining a single application, but when encountering related applications, users may rely on their prior understanding from previous explanations. This leads to either overgeneralization and AI overreliance, or burdensome independent memorization. Indeed, related decision tasks can share explanatory factors, but with some notable differences; e.g., body mass index (BMI) affects the risks for heart disease and diabetes at the same rate, but chest pain is more indicative of heart disease. Similarly, models using different attributes for the same task still share signals; e.g., temperature and pressure affect air pollution but in opposite directions due to the ideal gas law. Leveraging transfer of learning, we propose Transferable XAI to enable users to transfer understanding across related domains by explaining the relationship between domain explanations using a general affine transformation framework applied to linear factor explanations. The framework supports explanation transfer across various domain types: translation for data subspace (subsuming prior work on Incremental XAI), scaling for decision task, and mapping for attributes. Focusing on task and attributes domain types, in formative and summative user studies, we investigated how well participants could understand AI decisions from one domain to another. Compared to single-domain and domain-independent explanations, Transferable XAI was the most helpful for understanding the second domain, leading to the best decision faithfulness, factor recall, and ability to relate explanations between domains. This framework contributes to improving the reusability of explanations across related AI applications by explaining factor relationships between subspaces, tasks, and attributes.",

In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "While agentic AI systems rely on LLMs to translate user intent into structured function calls, this process is fraught with computational redundancy, leading to high inference latency that hinders real-time applications. This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single \"soft token.\" This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our \"dynamic templating\" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale. These results suggest that HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/HyFunc.",

However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization.

Existing fairness approaches in FL primarily focus on equalizing loss or accuracy conditional on participation, implicitly assuming that clients have comparable opportunities to contribute over time. However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance.",

Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly applied to question-answering over long academic papers, where accurate evidence allocation under a fixed token budget is critical. Existing approaches typically flatten academic papers into unstructured chunks during preprocessing, which destroys the native hierarchical structure. This loss forces retrieval to operate in a disordered space, thereby producing fragmented contexts, misallocating tokens to non-evidential regions under finite token budgets, and increasing the reasoning burden for downstream language models. To address these issues, we propose PT-RAG, an RAG framework that treats the native hierarchical structure of academic papers as a low-entropy retrieval prior. PT-RAG first inherits the native hierarchy to construct a structure-fidelity PaperTree index, which prevents entropy increase at the source. It then designs a path-guided retrieval mechanism that aligns query semantics to relevant sections and selects high relevance root-to-leaf paths under a fixed token budget, yielding compact, coherent, and low-entropy retrieval contexts. In contrast to existing RAG approaches, PT-RAG avoids entropy increase caused by destructive preprocessing and provides a native low-entropy structural basis for subsequent retrieval. To assess this design, we introduce entropy-based structural diagnostics that quantify retrieval fragmentation and evidence allocation accuracy. On three academic question-answering benchmarks, PT-RAG achieves consistently lower section entropy and evidence alignment cross entropy than strong baselines, indicating reduced context fragmentation and more precise allocation to evidential regions. These structural advantages directly translate into higher answer quality.",

Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone.

    "abstract": "With recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and complex task generation, artificial intelligence systems are transitioning from isolated single-agent architectures to multi-agent systems with collaborative intelligence. However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence.",

Drawing on psychological theories, we propose that anthropomorphism influences risk perception via two complementary forms of trust, and that domain knowledge moderates these relationships. To test our model, we conducted a large-scale online experiment (N = 1,256) on a financial decision-support system implementing different anthropomorphic designs. We found that anthropomorphism indirectly reduces risk perception by increasing both cognitive and affective trust. Domain knowledge moderates these paths: participants with low financial knowledge experience a negative indirect effect of perceived anthropomorphism on risk perception via cognitive trust, whereas those with high financial knowledge exhibit a positive direct and indirect effect. We discuss theoretical contributions to human-AI interaction and design implications for calibrating trust in anthropomorphic decision-support systems for responsible AI.",

Based on this observation, we introduce a mechanism that adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, improving long-term prediction reliability by reducing the compounding effect of conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs. Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measure and adaptive planning strategy, as evidenced by lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories that retain a high correlation with their ground truths.",

    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) are extensively utilized to enhance development efficiency, leading to numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, these benchmarks predominantly focus on implementation, overlooking the equally critical aspect of software design. This gap raises two pivotal questions: (1) Can LLMs handle software design? (2) Can LLMs write code following the specific designs? To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases. DesBench comprises 30 manually crafted Java projects that include requirement documents, design models, implementations, and acceptance tests, amounting to a total of 30 design models, 194 Java classes, and 737 test cases. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships. (3) Acceptance test cases generated by LLMs from functional requirements achieve code coverage quality comparable to those written by humans. Our research highlights the current limitations of LLMs in managing software design and calls for further investigation into new design methodologies and languages suitable for LLM-based development.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, utilizing beamforming techniques to address the inherent path loss limitation, is considered as one of the key technologies to support ever increasing high throughput and low latency demands of connected vehicles. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduction in the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the representative features from the sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, then, utilize multi-head cross-modal attention to learn dependencies and correlations between different modalities, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real world multimodal and 60 GHz mmWave wireless sensing data. The experiment reveals that the proposed framework (i) achieves up to 96.72% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, (ii) incurs roughly 0.77 dB average power loss, and (iii) improves the overall latency and beam searching space overheads by 86.81% and 76.56% respectively for top-15 beams compared to standard defined approach.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that this scaling law breaks in the context of multi-hop reasoning. We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice. Our findings suggest that the industry's \"smaller-is-better\" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks.",

Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments. Empirically, our evaluation shows that Hippocampus reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31$\\times$ and cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14$\\times$, while maintaining accuracy on both LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.",

TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing. To eliminate the dependence on costly human-annotated correspondence ground truth, TwInS is further equipped with a tailored semi-supervised training strategy, which unleashes the potential of large-scale multi-view data and enables continuous self-evolution without requiring ground-truth correspondences. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TwInS's core components and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps.

However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges, whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

Our approach makes two key innovations: (1) eliminating Bradley-Terry model dependencies by learning directly from binary win/loss outcomes in pairwise competitions, and (2) implementing Elo-orchestrated opponent selection that provides automatic curriculum learning through temperature-controlled sampling. We ground our approach in PAC learning theory, demonstrating that pairwise comparison achieves superior sample complexity and empirically validate a 4.5x noise reduction compared to absolute scoring approaches. Experimentally, we train a Qwen2.5-7B model using our framework with opponents including Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Qwen3-8B models.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks remain a critical challenge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis.",

This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.",

    "abstract": "While reasoning models have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, their increasing power necessitates stringent safety measures. For safety alignment, the core challenge lies in the inherent trade-off between safety and utility. However, prevailing alignment strategies typically construct CoT training data with explicit safety rules via context distillation. This approach inadvertently limits reasoning capabilities by creating a rigid association between rule memorization and refusal. To mitigate the safety-utility trade-off, we propose the Adaptive Safe Context Learning (ASCL) framework to improve the reasoning given proper context. ASCL formulates safety alignment as a multi-turn tool-use process, empowering the model to autonomously decide when to consult safety rules and how to generate the ongoing reasoning. Furthermore, to counteract the preference for rule consultation during RL, we introduce Inverse Frequency Policy Optimization (IFPO) to rebalance advantage estimates. By decoupling rule retrieval and subsequent reasoning, our method achieves higher overall performance compared to baselines.",

    "abstract": "To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \\textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \\textbf{71.6\\%}.",

Our results show that Discernment maintains semantic integrity even as channel capacity severely degrades, exhibiting very small and graceful performance decline in both classification accuracy and statistical fidelity of the reconstructed meaning. These findings demonstrate Discernment's ability to adjust to diverse physical channel conditions while maintaining spectral efficiency and low model complexity, making it well suited for IoT deployments and strongly motivating further research on this semantic channel paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative perception systems for autonomous driving aim to overcome the limited perception range of a single vehicle by communicating with adjacent agents to share sensing information. While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that elicit harmful or policy-violating outputs, while many existing defenses rely on expensive fine-tuning, intrusive prompt rewriting, or external guardrails that add latency and can degrade helpfulness. We present AISA, a lightweight, single-pass defense that activates safety behaviors already latent inside the model rather than treating safety as an add-on. AISA first localizes intrinsic safety awareness via spatiotemporal analysis and shows that intent-discriminative signals are broadly encoded, with especially strong separability appearing in the scaled dot-product outputs of specific attention heads near the final structural tokens before generation. Using a compact set of automatically selected heads, AISA extracts an interpretable prompt-risk score with minimal overhead, achieving detector-level performance competitive with strong proprietary baselines on small (7B) models. AISA then performs logits-level steering: it modulates the decoding distribution in proportion to the inferred risk, ranging from normal generation for benign prompts to calibrated refusal for high-risk requests -- without changing model parameters, adding auxiliary modules, or requiring multi-pass inference. Extensive experiments spanning 13 datasets, 12 LLMs, and 14 baselines demonstrate that AISA improves robustness and transfer while preserving utility and reducing false refusals, enabling safer deployment even for weakly aligned or intentionally risky model variants.",

Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications.",

We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.",

    "abstract": "Identifying feature representations in language models is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.",

    "abstract": "Natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation enables non-expert users to query relational databases through natural language. Recently, NL2SQL agents, powered by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly advanced NL2SQL translation. Nonetheless, NL2SQL agents still make mistakes when faced with large-scale real-world databases because they lack knowledge of how to correctly leverage the underlying data (e.g., knowledge about the intent of each column) and form misconceptions about the data when querying it, leading to errors. Prior work has studied generating facts about the database to provide more context to NL2SQL agents, but such approaches simply restate database contents without addressing the agent's misconceptions. In this paper, we propose Tk-Boost, a bolt-on framework for augmenting any NL2SQL agent with tribal knowledge: knowledge that corrects the agent's misconceptions in querying the database accumulated through experience using the database. To accumulate experience, Tk-Boost first asks the NL2SQL agent to answer a few queries on the database, identifies the agent's misconceptions by analyzing its mistakes on the database, and generates tribal knowledge to address them. To enable accurate retrieval, Tk-Boost indexes this knowledge with applicability conditions that specify the query features for which the knowledge is useful. When answering new queries, Tk-Boost uses this knowledge to provide feedback to the NL2SQL agent, resolving the agent's misconceptions during SQL generation, and thus improving the agent's accuracy. Extensive experiments across the BIRD and Spider 2.0 benchmarks with various NL2SQL agents shows Tk-Boost improves NL2SQL agents accuracy by up to 16.9% on Spider 2.0 and 13.7% on BIRD",

    "abstract": "LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act \"in the wild\", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of \"output\" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type.

We introduce and study $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concavity, a novel first-order condition that characterizes a broad class of such functions. This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $γ$, $θ$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints.",

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of large language models into newsroom workflows has raised urgent questions about the prevalence of AI-generated content in online media. While computational studies have begun to quantify this phenomenon in English-language outlets, no empirical investigation exists for Turkish news media, where existing research remains limited to qualitative interviews with journalists or fake news detection. This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to move beyond self-reported journalist perceptions toward empirical, data-driven measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media.",

TrasMuon addresses this by defining a trust region based on relative energy ratios, confining updates to a stable zone. Empirical experiments on vision and language models demonstrate that TrasMuon converges faster than baselines. Furthermore, experiments without warmup stages confirm TrasMuon's superior stability and robustness.",

    "abstract": "1. Many ecological decisions are slowed by the gap between collecting and analysing biodiversity data. Edge computing moves processing closer to the sensor, with edge artificial intelligence (AI) enabling on-device inference, reducing reliance on data transfer and continuous connectivity. In principle, this shifts biodiversity monitoring from passive logging towards autonomous, responsive sensing systems. In practice, however, adoption remains fragmented, with key architectural trade-offs, performance constraints, and implementation challenges rarely reported systematically. 2. Here, we analyse 82 studies published between 2017 and 2025 that implement edge computing for biodiversity monitoring across acoustic, vision, tracking, and multi-modal systems. We synthesise hardware platforms, AI model optimisation, and wireless communication to critically assess how design choices shape ecological inference, deployment longevity, and operational feasibility. 3. Publications increased from 3 in 2017 to 19 in 2025. We identify four system types: (I) TinyML, low-power microcontrollers (MCUs) for single-taxon or rare-event detection; (II) Edge AI, single-board computers (SBCs) for multi-species classification and real-time alerts; (III) Distributed edge AI; and (IV) Cloud AI for retrospective processing pipelines. Each system type represents context-dependent trade-offs among power consumption, computational capability, and communication requirements. 4. Our analysis reveals the evolution of edge computing systems from proof-of-concept to robust, scalable tools. We argue that edge computing offers opportunities for responsive biodiversity management, but realising this potential requires increased collaboration between ecologists, engineers, and data scientists to align model development and system design with ecological questions, field constraints, and ethical considerations.",

CHI papers routinely reference 'pilot studies', 'pilot tests', or 'preliminary studies' to justify design decisions, verify procedures, or motivate methodological choices. Yet despite their frequency, the role of pilot studies in HCI remains conceptually vague and empirically underexamined. Unlike fields such as medicine, nursing, and education, where pilot and feasibility studies have well-established definitions, guidelines, reporting standards and even a dedicated research journal, the CHI community lacks a shared understanding of what constitutes a pilot study, why they are conducted, and how they should be reported. Many papers reference pilots 'in passing', without details about design, outcomes, or how the pilot informed the main study. This variability suggests a methodological blind spot in our community.",

    "abstract": "Federated low-rank adaptation (FedLoRA) has facilitated communication-efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning of foundation models for downstream tasks. In practical federated learning scenarios, client heterogeneity in system resources and data distributions motivates heterogeneous LoRA ranks across clients. We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.",

Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \\textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.",

    "abstract": "Although foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in general domains, the application of these models to electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is constrained by substantial data requirements and high parameterization. These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.",

Unlike traditional visual interpretation tools that provide access through captions and OCR (text recognition through camera input), MLLM-enabled applications support access through conversational assistance, where users can ask questions to obtain goal-relevant details. However, evidence about their performance in the real-world and their implications for BLV people's everyday life remain limited. To address this, we conducted a two-week diary study, where we captured 20 BLV participants' use of an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application. Although participants rated the visual interpretations of the application as \"somewhat trustworthy\" (mean=3.76 out of 5, max=very trustworthy) and \"somewhat satisfying\" (mean=4.13 out of 5, max=very satisfying), the AI often produced incorrect answers (22.2%) or abstained (10.8%) from responding to follow-up requests. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can improve the accuracy of descriptive visual interpretations, but that supporting everyday use also depends on the \"visual assistant\" skill -- a set of behaviors for providing goal-directed, reliable assistance. We conclude by proposing the \"visual assistant\" skill and practical guidelines to help future MLLM-enabled visual interpretation applications better support BLV people's access to visual information.",

    "abstract": "The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed.",

Grounded in sociological and social-psychological theory, we examine behavior along four dimensions: intent and motivation, norms and templates, incentives and behavioral drift, emotion and contagion.\n  Our analysis revealed that agents strongly respond to social rewards and rapidly converge on community-specific interaction templates, resembling human patterns of incentive sensitivity and normative conformity. However, they are predominantly knowledge-driven rather than persona-aligned, and display limited emotional reciprocity along with weak dialogic engagement, which diverges systematically from human online communities.\n  Together, these results reveal both similarities and differences between artificial and human social systems and provide an empirical foundation for understanding, designing, and governing large-scale agent communities.",

This study focuses on detecting abusive obfuscated language in Swahili, a low-resource language that poses unique challenges due to its limited linguistic resources and technological support. Swahili is chosen due to its popularity and being the most widely spoken language in Africa, with over 16 million native speakers and upwards of 100 million speakers in total, spanning regions in East Africa and some parts of the Middle East.\n  We employed machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, optimized through rigorous parameter tuning and techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance. Our analysis revealed that, while these models perform well in high-dimensional textual data, our dataset's small size and imbalance limit our findings' generalizability. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were thoroughly analyzed, highlighting the nuanced performance of each model in detecting obfuscated language.\n  This research contributes to the broader discourse on ensuring safer online environments for children, advocating for expanded datasets and advanced machine-learning techniques to improve the effectiveness of cyberbullying detection systems.

Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input.

While existing works either assume additive white Gaussian noise channels or treat fading channels without a fully end-to-end learning approach, our framework directly embeds the wireless channel into both training and inference. To account for practical channel state information (CSI), we further incorporate limited feedback via both uniform and Lloyd-Max quantization of channel gains and analyze their impact on AE training and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that, with perfect CSI, the proposed AE outperforms the existing analytical NOMA schemes. In addition, Lloyd-Max quantization achieves superior BER performance compared to uniform quantization. These results demonstrate that end-to-end AEs trained directly over Rayleigh fading can effectively learn robust, interference-aware signaling strategies, paving the way for NOMA deployment in fading environments with realistic CSI constraints.",

An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where inducing a bias toward a certain topic can have significant consequences, and backdoor attacks can be used to produce such models. Prior work on backdoor attacks has largely focused on a black-box threat model, with an adversary targeting the model builder's LLM. However, in the bias manipulation setting, the model builder themselves could be the adversary, warranting a white-box threat model where the attacker's ability to poison, and manipulate the poisoned data is substantially increased. Furthermore, despite growing research in semantically-triggered backdoors, most studies have limited themselves to syntactically-triggered attacks. Motivated by these limitations, we conduct an analysis consisting of over 1000 evaluations using higher poisoning ratios and greater data augmentation to gain a better understanding of the potential of syntactically- and semantically-triggered backdoor attacks in a white-box setting. In addition, we study whether two representative defense paradigms, model-intrinsic and model-extrinsic backdoor removal, are able to mitigate these attacks. Our analysis reveals numerous new findings. We discover that while both syntactically- and semantically-triggered attacks can effectively induce the target behaviour, and largely preserve utility, semantically-triggered attacks are generally more effective in inducing negative biases, while both backdoor types struggle with causing positive biases. Furthermore, while both defense types are able to mitigate these backdoors, they either result in a substantial drop in utility, or require high computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Computation in biological systems is fundamentally energy-constrained, yet standard theories of computation treat energy as freely available. Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the *coding rate* -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the *firing rate* -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder (P-VAE) -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of *sparse coding* as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient $β$ and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing $β$ monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in scientific domains like retrosynthesis; yet, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary to navigate complex problem spaces without error. A critical challenge is directing an LLM to avoid specific, chemically sensitive sites on a molecule - a task where unconstrained generation can lead to invalid or undesirable synthetic pathways. In this work, we introduce Protect$^*$, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55+ SMARTS patterns and 40+ characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) are commonly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore long chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving strong performance at high computational cost. Recent methods add multi-reward objectives to jointly optimize correctness and brevity, but these complex extensions often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%. Our code is available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/On-Policy-SFT.",

    "abstract": "A common problem for agents operating in real-world environments is that the\nresponse of an environment to their actions may be non-deterministic and\nobserved through noise. This renders environmental state and progress towards\ncompleting a task latent. Despite recent impressive demonstrations of LLM's\nreasoning abilities on various benchmarks, whether LLMs can build estimates of\nlatent state and leverage them for reasoning has not been explicitly studied.\nWe investigate this problem in the real-world domain of autonomous UI agents.\nWe establish that appropriately prompting LLMs in a zero-shot manner can be\nformally understood as forming point estimates of latent state in a textual\nspace. In the context of autonomous UI agents we then show that LLMs used in\nthis manner are more than $76\\%$ accurate at inferring various aspects of\nlatent state, such as performed (vs. commanded) actions and task progression.\nUsing both public and internal benchmarks and three reasoning methods\n(zero-shot, CoT-SC & ReAct), we show that LLM-powered agents that explicitly\nestimate and reason about latent state are able to successfully complete up to\n1.6x more tasks than those that do not.",

    "abstract": "Automated plot generation for games enhances the player's experience by\nproviding rich and immersive narrative experience that adapts to the player's\nactions. Traditional approaches adopt a symbolic narrative planning method\nwhich limits the scale and complexity of the generated plot by requiring\nextensive knowledge engineering work. Recent advancements use Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to drive the behavior of virtual characters, allowing plots to\nemerge from interactions between characters and their environments. However,\nthe emergent nature of such decentralized plot generation makes it difficult\nfor authors to direct plot progression. We propose a novel plot creation\nworkflow that mediates between a writer's authorial intent and the emergent\nbehaviors from LLM-driven character simulation, through a novel authorial\nstructure called \"abstract acts\". The writers define high-level plot outlines\nthat are later transformed into concrete character action sequences via an\nLLM-based narrative planning process, based on the game world state. The\nprocess creates \"living stories\" that dynamically adapt to various game world\nstates, resulting in narratives co-created by the author, character simulation,\nand player. We present StoryVerse as a proof-of-concept system to demonstrate\nthis plot creation workflow. We showcase the versatility of our approach with\nexamples in different stories and game environments.",

    "abstract": "We study watermarking schemes for language models with provable guarantees.\nAs we show, prior works offer no robustness guarantees against adaptive\nprompting: when a user queries a language model more than once, as even benign\nusers do. And with just a single exception (Christ and Gunn, 2024), prior works\nare restricted to zero-bit watermarking: machine-generated text can be detected\nas such, but no additional information can be extracted from the watermark.\nUnfortunately, merely detecting AI-generated text may not prevent future\nabuses.\n  We introduce multi-user watermarks, which allow tracing model-generated text\nto individual users or to groups of colluding users, even in the face of\nadaptive prompting. We construct multi-user watermarking schemes from\nundetectable, adaptively robust, zero-bit watermarking schemes (and prove that\nthe undetectable zero-bit scheme of Christ, Gunn, and Zamir (2024) is\nadaptively robust). Importantly, our scheme provides both zero-bit and\nmulti-user assurances at the same time. It detects shorter snippets just as\nwell as the original scheme, and traces longer excerpts to individuals.\n  The main technical component is a construction of message-embedding\nwatermarks from zero-bit watermarks. Ours is the first generic reduction\nbetween watermarking schemes for language models. A challenge for such\nreductions is the lack of a unified abstraction for robustness -- that marked\ntext is detectable even after edits. We introduce a new unifying abstraction\ncalled AEB-robustness. AEB-robustness provides that the watermark is detectable\nwhenever the edited text \"approximates enough blocks\" of model-generated\noutput.",

Previous approaches try to\nmitigate this using task-specific (TS) EEG signals from the target subject in\ntraining. However, recording TS EEG signals requires time and limits its\napplicability in various fields. In contrast, resting state (RS) EEG signals\nare a viable alternative due to ease of acquisition with rich subject\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a novel subject-adaptive transfer\nlearning strategy that utilizes RS EEG signals to adapt models on unseen\nsubject data. Specifically, we disentangle extracted features into task- and\nsubject-dependent features and use them to calibrate RS EEG signals for\nobtaining task information while preserving subject characteristics. The\ncalibrated signals are then used to adapt the model to the target subject,\nenabling the model to simulate processing TS EEG signals of the target subject.\nThe proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three public\nbenchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in cross-subject EEG\nMI classification.

DINO is one such method based on a cross-entropy\nloss between $K$-dimensional probability vectors, obtained by applying a\nsoftmax function to the dot product between representations and learnt\nprototypes. Given the fact that the learned representations are\n$L^2$-normalized, we show that DINO and its derivatives, such as iBOT, can be\ninterpreted as a mixture model of von Mises-Fisher components. With this\ninterpretation, DINO assumes equal precision for all components when the\nprototypes are also $L^2$-normalized. Using this insight we propose DINO-vMF,\nthat adds appropriate normalization constants when computing the cluster\nassignment probabilities. Unlike DINO, DINO-vMF is stable also for the larger\nViT-Base model with unnormalized prototypes. We show that the added flexibility\nof the mixture model is beneficial in terms of better image representations.\nThe DINO-vMF pre-trained model consistently performs better than DINO on a\nrange of downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to\nbenchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building\nthis understanding, but the requirement of training models across many\ndifferent scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative,\nobservational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling\nlaws from ~100 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from\nmultiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their\ntraining compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these\nvariations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language\nmodel performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and\nmodel families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to\ncapabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of\ncomplex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a\nsmooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that\nthe agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from\nsimpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of\npost-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as\nlanguage model capabilities continue to improve.",

To mitigate potential discrimination\nand enhance the overall usability and accessibility for diverse language user\ngroups, it is important for the development of language-fair technology.\nDespite the breakthroughs of LLMs, the investigation into the multilingual\nscenario remains insufficient, where a comprehensive survey to summarize recent\napproaches, developments, limitations, and potential solutions is desirable. To\nthis end, we provide a survey with multiple perspectives on the utilization of\nLLMs in the multilingual scenario. We first rethink the transitions between\nprevious and current research on pre-trained language models. Then we introduce\nseveral perspectives on the multilingualism of LLMs, including training and\ninference methods, information retrieval, model security, multi-domain with\nlanguage culture, and usage of datasets. We also discuss the major challenges\nthat arise in these aspects, along with possible solutions. Besides, we\nhighlight future research directions that aim at further enhancing LLMs with\nmultilingualism. The survey aims to help the research community address\nmultilingual problems and provide a comprehensive understanding of the core\nconcepts, key techniques, and latest developments in multilingual natural\nlanguage processing based on LLMs.",

We conducted a plasmode simulation\nstudy using data from opioid vs. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)\ninitiators (X) with observed serum creatinine labs (Z2) and time-to-acute\nkidney injury as outcome. We simulated 100 cohorts with a null treatment\neffect, including X, Z2, atrial fibrillation (U), and 13 other\ninvestigator-derived confounders (Z1) in the outcome generation. We then\nimposed missingness (MZ2) on 50% of Z2 measurements as a function of Z2 and U\nand created different HDMI candidate AC using structured and NLP-derived\nfeatures. We mimicked scenarios where U was unobserved by omitting it from all\nAC candidate sets. Using LASSO, we data-adaptively selected HDMI covariates\nassociated with Z2 and MZ2 for MI, and with U to include in propensity score\nmodels. The treatment effect was estimated following propensity score matching\nin MI datasets and we benchmarked HDMI approaches against a baseline imputation\nand complete case analysis with Z1 only. HDMI using claims data showed the\nlowest bias (0.072). Combining claims and sentence embeddings led to an\nimprovement in the efficiency displaying the lowest root-mean-squared-error\n(0.173) and coverage (94%).

    "abstract": "In the e-commerce domain, the accurate extraction of attribute-value pairs\n(e.g., Brand: Apple) from product titles and user search queries is crucial for\nenhancing search and recommendation systems. A major challenge with neural\nmodels for this task is the lack of high-quality training data, as the\nannotations for attribute-value pairs in the available datasets are often\nincomplete. To address this, we introduce GenToC, a model designed for training\ndirectly with partially-labeled data, eliminating the necessity for a fully\nannotated dataset. GenToC employs a marker-augmented generative model to\nidentify potential attributes, followed by a token classification model that\ndetermines the associated values for each attribute. GenToC outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art models, exhibiting upto 56.3% increase in the number\nof accurate extractions. Furthermore, we utilize GenToC to regenerate the\ntraining dataset to expand attribute-value annotations. This bootstrapping\nsubstantially improves the data quality for training other standard NER models,\nwhich are typically faster but less capable in handling partially-labeled data,\nenabling them to achieve comparable performance to GenToC. Our results\ndemonstrate GenToC's unique ability to learn from a limited set of\npartially-labeled data and improve the training of more efficient models,\nadvancing the automated extraction of attribute-value pairs. Finally, our model\nhas been successfully integrated into IndiaMART, India's largest B2B e-commerce\nplatform, achieving a significant increase of 20.2% in the number of correctly\nidentified attribute-value pairs over the existing deployed system while\nachieving a high precision of 89.5%.",

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse,\novercomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations,\nhave been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about\nthe structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network.\nThere is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in\nthese dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose\nend-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that\nensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL\ndivergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model\nwith SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a\nPareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total\nfeatures, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all\nwith no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative\ndifferences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary\nlearning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior\nconcisely and accurately.

Astronomers\nare turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are\nlimited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate\nworkloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we\nbuilt a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large\nvision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological\nclassification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and\nmore.

The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot\nlearning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned\ntasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for\nobject detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an\naccuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%;\nfor morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only\nrequests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18.

Recognizing and considering political bias within LLM applications is\nespecially important when closing in on the tipping point toward performative\nprediction. Then, being educated about potential effects and the societal\nbehavior LLMs can drive at scale due to their interplay with human operators.\nIn this way, the upcoming elections of the European Parliament will not remain\nunaffected by LLMs. We evaluate the political bias of the currently most\npopular open-source LLMs (instruct or assistant models) concerning political\nissues within the European Union (EU) from a German voter's perspective. To do\nso, we use the \"Wahl-O-Mat,\" a voting advice application used in Germany. From\nthe voting advice of the \"Wahl-O-Mat\" we quantize the degree of alignment of\nLLMs with German political parties. We show that larger models, such as\nLlama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning political parties,\nwhile smaller models often remain neutral, particularly when prompted in\nEnglish. The central finding is that LLMs are similarly biased, with low\nvariances in the alignment concerning a specific party. Our findings underline\nthe importance of rigorously assessing and making bias transparent in LLMs to\nsafeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of applications that employ the\ncapabilities of performative prediction and the invisible hand of machine\nlearning prediction and language generation.",

    "abstract": "Generative pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nimpressive performance over a wide range of tasks, thanks to the unprecedented\namount of data they have been trained on. As established scaling laws indicate,\nLLMs' future performance improvement depends on the amount of computing and\ndata sources they can leverage for pre-training. Federated learning (FL) has\nthe potential to unleash the majority of the planet's data and computational\nresources, which are underutilized by the data-center-focused training\nmethodology of current LLM practice. Our work presents a robust, flexible,\nreproducible FL approach that enables large-scale collaboration across\ninstitutions to train LLMs. We propose a scalable deployment system called\nPhoton to enable the investigation and development of this new training\nparadigm for LLM pre-training. We show that Photon can be used by organizations\ninterested in collaborating with their private data sources and computational\nresources for pre-training LLMs with billions of parameters. This paradigm\nwould mobilize more computational and data resources while matching or\npotentially exceeding centralized performance. We further show the\neffectiveness of the federated training scales with model size and present our\napproach for training billion-scale federated LLMs using limited resources.\nThus far, we have used Photon to train LLM models to the size of 7B parameters\nand anticipate larger models being completed in the near future. Finally, we\nshow that LLM training is highly resilient to the classical challenges of\nfederated statistical and hardware heterogeneity. Furthermore, we show that\nconvergence is robust to partial participation, opening the avenue for\ncompute-efficient collaborative training. Photon will help data-rich actors to\nbecome the protagonists of LLMs pre-training instead of leaving the stage to\ncompute-rich actors alone.",

Enriching\nsuch interpretations with higher-order interactions is inevitable for complex\nsystems, where the Shapley Interaction Index (SII) is a direct axiomatic\nextension of the SV. While it is well-known that the SV yields an optimal\napproximation of any game via a weighted least square (WLS) objective, an\nextension of this result to SII has been a long-standing open problem, which\neven led to the proposal of an alternative index. In this work, we characterize\nhigher-order SII as a solution to a WLS problem, which constructs an optimal\napproximation via SII and $k$-Shapley values ($k$-SII). We prove this\nrepresentation for the SV and pairwise SII and give empirically validated\nconjectures for higher orders. As a result, we propose KernelSHAP-IQ, a direct\nextension of KernelSHAP for SII, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance\nfor feature interactions.",

    "abstract": "Transformers are one of the key assets in AC distribution grids and renewable\npower integration. During transformer energization inrush currents appear,\nwhich lead to transformer degradation and can cause grid instability events.\nThese inrush currents are a consequence of the transformer's magnetic core\nsaturation during its connection to the grid. Transformer cores are normally\nmodelled by the Jiles-Atherton (JA) model which contains five parameters. These\nparameters can be estimated by metaheuristic-based search algorithms. The\nparameter initialization of these algorithms plays an important role in the\nalgorithm convergence. The most popular strategy used for JA parameter\ninitialization is a random uniform distribution. However, techniques such as\nparameter initialization by Probability Density Functions (PDFs) have shown to\nimprove accuracy over random methods. In this context, this research work\npresents a framework to assess the impact of different parameter initialization\nstrategies on the performance of the JA parameter estimation for inrush current\nstudies. Depending on available data and expert knowledge, uncertainty levels\nare modelled with different PDFs. Moreover, three different\nmetaheuristic-search algorithms are employed on two different core materials\nand their accuracy and computational time are compared. Results show an\nimprovement in the accuracy and computational time of the metaheuristic-based\nalgorithms when PDF parameter initialization is used.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of AI systems for welfare benefit allocation allows for\naccelerated decision-making and faster provision of critical help, but has\nalready led to an increase in unfair benefit denials and false fraud\naccusations. Collecting data in the US and the UK (N = 2449), we explore the\npublic acceptability of such speed-accuracy trade-offs in populations of\nclaimants and non-claimants. We observe a general willingness to trade off\nspeed gains for modest accuracy losses, but this aggregate view masks notable\ndivergences between claimants and non-claimants. Although welfare claimants\ncomprise a relatively small proportion of the general population (e.g., 20% in\nthe US representative sample), this vulnerable group is much less willing to\naccept AI deployed in welfare systems, raising concerns that solely using\naggregate data for calibration could lead to policies misaligned with\nstakeholder preferences. Our study further uncovers asymmetric insights between\nclaimants and non-claimants. The latter consistently overestimate claimant\nwillingness to accept speed-accuracy trade-offs, even when financially\nincentivized for accurate perspective-taking. This suggests that policy\ndecisions influenced by the dominant voice of non-claimants, however\nwell-intentioned, may neglect the actual preferences of those directly affected\nby welfare AI systems.

Most work on POMDPs\nfocuses on synthesizing strategies based on the available capabilities.\nHowever, system designers can often control an agent's observation\ncapabilities, e.g. by placing or selecting sensors. This raises the question of\nhow one should select an agent's sensors cost-effectively such that it achieves\nthe desired goals. In this paper, we study the novel optimal observability\nproblem OOP: Given a POMDP M, how should one change M's observation\ncapabilities within a fixed budget such that its (minimal) expected reward\nremains below a given threshold? We show that the problem is undecidable in\ngeneral and decidable when considering positional strategies only.

    "abstract": "Artificially sweetened beverages like Diet Coke are often considered better\nalternatives to sugary drinks, but the debate over their impact on health,\nparticularly in relation to obesity, continues. Previous research has\npredominantly used association-based methods with observational or Randomized\nControlled Trial (RCT) data, which may not accurately capture the causal\nrelationship between Diet Coke consumption and obesity, leading to potentially\nlimited conclusions. In contrast, we employed causal inference methods using\nstructural causal models, integrating both observational and RCT data.\nSpecifically, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), which includes diverse demographic information, as\nour observational data source. This data was then used to construct a causal\ngraph, and the back-door criterion, along with its adjustment formula, was\napplied to estimate the RCT data. We then calculated the counterfactual\nquantity, the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS), using both NHANES\ndata and estimated RCT data. We propose that PNS is the essential metric for\nassessing the impact of Diet Coke on obesity. Our results indicate that between\n20 to 50 percent of individuals, especially those with poor dietary habits, are\nmore likely to gain weight from Diet Coke. Conversely, in groups like young\nfemales with healthier diets, only a small proportion experience weight gain\ndue to Diet Coke.

Hence, in this research, the core\nobjective is the development of a semantics-based data integration middleware\nthat encompasses and integrates heterogeneous data models of local indigenous\nknowledge and sensor data towards an accurate drought forecasting system for\nthe study areas. The local indigenous knowledge on drought gathered from the\ndomain experts is transformed into rules to be used for performing deductive\ninference in conjunction with sensors data for determining the onset of drought\nthrough an automated inference generation module of the middleware. The\nsemantic middleware incorporates, inter alia, a distributed architecture that\nconsists of a streaming data processing engine based on Apache Kafka for\nreal-time stream processing; a rule-based reasoning module; an ontology module\nfor semantic representation of the knowledge bases.",

    "abstract": "Diaspora communities are disproportionately impacted by off-the-radar\nmisinformation and often neglected by mainstream fact-checking efforts,\ncreating a critical need to scale-up efforts of nascent fact-checking\ninitiatives. In this paper we present SynDy, a framework for Synthetic Dynamic\nDataset Generation to leverage the capabilities of the largest frontier Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to train local, specialized language models. To the best\nof our knowledge, SynDy is the first paper utilizing LLMs to create\nfine-grained synthetic labels for tasks of direct relevance to misinformation\nmitigation, namely Claim Matching, Topical Clustering, and Claim Relationship\nClassification. SynDy utilizes LLMs and social media queries to automatically\ngenerate distantly-supervised, topically-focused datasets with synthetic labels\non these three tasks, providing essential tools to scale up human-led\nfact-checking at a fraction of the cost of human-annotated data. Training on\nSynDy's generated labels shows improvement over a standard baseline and is not\nsignificantly worse compared to training on human labels (which may be\ninfeasible to acquire). SynDy is being integrated into Meedan's chatbot\ntiplines that are used by over 50 organizations, serve over 230K users\nannually, and automatically distribute human-written fact-checks via messaging\napps such as WhatsApp. SynDy will also be integrated into our deployed\nCo-Insights toolkit, enabling low-resource organizations to launch tiplines for\ntheir communities. Finally, we envision SynDy enabling additional fact-checking\ntools such as matching new misinformation claims to high-quality explainers on\ncommon misinformation topics.",

In this review, 183\narticles were initially selected from different journals, among which 80\nrecords were enlisted for explicit review, ranging from 2016 to 2023. Brain\nwaves were the most commonly employed body parameters for sleep staging and\ndisorder studies (almost 29% of the research used brain activity signals\nexclusively, and 77% combined with the other signals). The convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN), the most widely used of the 34 distinct artificial intelligence\nmodels, comprised 27%. The other models included the long short-term memory\n(LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN), which consisted of 11%, 6%, 6%, and 5% sequentially. For\nperformance metrics, accuracy was widely used for a maximum of 83.75% of the\ncases, the F1 score of 45%, Kappa of 36.25%, Sensitivity of 31.25%, and\nSpecificity of 30% of cases, along with the other metrics.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention for addressing data scarcity and\nprivacy concerns. While parallel FL algorithms like FedAvg exhibit remarkable\nperformance, they face challenges in scenarios with diverse network speeds and\nconcerns about centralized control, especially in multi-institutional\ncollaborations like the medical domain. Serial FL presents an alternative\nsolution, circumventing these challenges by transferring model updates serially\nbetween devices in a cyclical manner. Nevertheless, it is deemed inferior to\nparallel FL in that (1) its performance shows undesirable fluctuations, and (2)\nit converges to a lower plateau, particularly when dealing with non-IID data.\nThe observed phenomenon is attributed to catastrophic forgetting due to\nknowledge loss from previous sites. In this paper, to overcome fluctuation and\nlow efficiency in the iterative learning and forgetting process, we introduce\ncyclical weight consolidation (CWC), a straightforward yet potent approach\nspecifically tailored for serial FL. CWC employs a consolidation matrix to\nregulate local optimization. This matrix tracks the significance of each\nparameter on the overall federation throughout the entire training trajectory,\npreventing abrupt changes in significant weights. During revisitation, to\nmaintain adaptability, old memory undergoes decay to incorporate new\ninformation. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that in various non-IID\nsettings, CWC mitigates the fluctuation behavior of the original serial FL\napproach and enhances the converged performance consistently and significantly.\nThe improved performance is either comparable to or better than the parallel\nvanilla.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based encoder-decoder models have demonstrated impressive results\nin chemical reaction prediction tasks. However, these models typically rely on\npretraining using tens of millions of unlabelled molecules, which can be\ntime-consuming and GPU-intensive. One of the central questions we aim to answer\nin this work is: Can FlanT5 and ByT5, the encode-decoder models pretrained\nsolely on language data, be effectively specialised for organic reaction\nprediction through task-specific fine-tuning? We conduct a systematic empirical\nstudy on several key issues of the process, including tokenisation, the impact\nof (SMILES-oriented) pretraining, fine-tuning sample efficiency, and decoding\nalgorithms at inference. Our key findings indicate that although being\npretrained only on language tasks, FlanT5 and ByT5 provide a solid foundation\nto fine-tune for reaction prediction, and thus become `chemistry domain\ncompatible' in the process. This suggests that GPU-intensive and expensive\npretraining on a large dataset of unlabelled molecules may be useful yet not\nessential to leverage the power of language models for chemistry. All our\nmodels achieve comparable Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy although some variation\nacross different models does exist. Notably, tokenisation and vocabulary\ntrimming slightly affect final performance but can speed up training and\ninference; The most efficient greedy decoding strategy is very competitive\nwhile only marginal gains can be achieved from more sophisticated decoding\nalgorithms. In summary, we evaluate FlanT5 and ByT5 across several dimensions\nand benchmark their impact on organic reaction prediction, which may guide more\neffective use of these state-of-the-art language models for chemistry-related\ntasks in the future.",

To handle the inherent complexities of\ntime-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised\nlearning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each\ntask, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In\ncontrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by\nleveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can\nthen be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Our goal is to accomplish VideoQA\ntasks directly based on video semantics over noisy or fading wireless channels,\nbypassing the need for video reconstruction at the receiver. To this end, we\ndevelop a spatiotemporal semantic encoder for effective video semantic\nextraction, and a learning-based bandwidth-adaptive deep joint source-channel\ncoding (DJSCC) scheme for efficient and robust video semantic transmission.\nExperiments demonstrate that VideoQA-SC outperforms traditional and advanced\nDJSCC-based SC systems that rely on video reconstruction at the receiver under\na wide range of channel conditions and bandwidth constraints. In particular,\nwhen the signal-to-noise ratio is low, VideoQA-SC can improve the answer\naccuracy by 5.17% while saving almost 99.5\\% of the bandwidth at the same time,\ncompared with the advanced DJSCC-based SC system. Our results show the great\npotential of SC system design for video applications.",

    "abstract": "In light of recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) that have\nrevolutionized natural language processing (NLP), there is an urgent need for\nnew benchmarks to keep pace with the fast development of LLMs. In this paper,\nwe propose CFLUE, the Chinese Financial Language Understanding Evaluation\nbenchmark, designed to assess the capability of LLMs across various dimensions.\nSpecifically, CFLUE provides datasets tailored for both knowledge assessment\nand application assessment. In knowledge assessment, it consists of 38K+\nmultiple-choice questions with associated solution explanations. These\nquestions serve dual purposes: answer prediction and question reasoning. In\napplication assessment, CFLUE features 16K+ test instances across distinct\ngroups of NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, relation\nextraction, reading comprehension, and text generation. Upon CFLUE, we conduct\na thorough evaluation of representative LLMs. The results reveal that only\nGPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo achieve an accuracy exceeding 60\\% in answer prediction\nfor knowledge assessment, suggesting that there is still substantial room for\nimprovement in current LLMs. In application assessment, although GPT-4 and\nGPT-4-turbo are the top two performers, their considerable advantage over\nlightweight LLMs is noticeably diminished. The datasets and scripts associated\nwith CFLUE are openly accessible at https://github.com/aliyun/cflue.",

    "abstract": "Energy storage devices, such as batteries, thermal energy storages, and\nhydrogen systems, can help mitigate climate change by ensuring a more stable\nand sustainable power supply. To maximize the effectiveness of such energy\nstorage, determining the appropriate charging and discharging amounts for each\ntime period is crucial. Reinforcement learning is preferred over traditional\noptimization for the control of energy storage due to its ability to adapt to\ndynamic and complex environments. However, the continuous nature of charging\nand discharging levels in energy storage poses limitations for discrete\nreinforcement learning, and time-varying feasible charge-discharge range based\non state of charge (SoC) variability also limits the conventional continuous\nreinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a continuous reinforcement\nlearning approach that takes into account the time-varying feasible\ncharge-discharge range. An additional objective function was introduced for\nlearning the feasible action range for each time period, supplementing the\nobjectives of training the actor for policy learning and the critic for value\nlearning. This actively promotes the utilization of energy storage by\npreventing them from getting stuck in suboptimal states, such as continuous\nfull charging or discharging. This is achieved through the enforcement of the\ncharging and discharging levels into the feasible action range. The\nexperimental results demonstrated that the proposed method further maximized\nthe effectiveness of energy storage by actively enhancing its utilization.",

    "abstract": "Large language models have become increasingly prominent, also signaling a\nshift towards multimodality as the next frontier in artificial intelligence,\nwhere their embeddings are harnessed as prompts to generate textual content.\nVision-language models (VLMs) stand at the forefront of this advancement,\noffering innovative ways to combine visual and textual data for enhanced\nunderstanding and interaction. However, this integration also enlarges the\nattack surface. Patch-based adversarial attack is considered the most realistic\nthreat model in physical vision applications, as demonstrated in many existing\nliterature. In this paper, we propose to address patched visual prompt\ninjection, where adversaries exploit adversarial patches to generate target\ncontent in VLMs. Our investigation reveals that patched adversarial prompts\nexhibit sensitivity to pixel-wise randomization, a trait that remains robust\neven against adaptive attacks designed to counteract such defenses. Leveraging\nthis insight, we introduce SmoothVLM, a defense mechanism rooted in smoothing\ntechniques, specifically tailored to protect VLMs from the threat of patched\nvisual prompt injectors. Our framework significantly lowers the attack success\nrate to a range between 0% and 5.0% on two leading VLMs, while achieving around\n67.3% to 95.0% context recovery of the benign images, demonstrating a balance\nbetween security and usability.",

It uniquely utilizes the LLMs being tested to compute the probability\ndiscrepancy between the initial response and its revised versions.

Existing fact verification models usually\nbuild a fully connected reasoning graph, which regards claim-evidence pairs as\nnodes and connects them with edges. They employ the graph to propagate the\nsemantics of the nodes. Nevertheless, the noisy nodes usually propagate their\nsemantics via the edges of the reasoning graph, which misleads the semantic\nrepresentations of other nodes and amplifies the noise signals. To mitigate the\npropagation of noisy semantic information, we introduce a Confidential Graph\nAttention Network (CO-GAT), which proposes a node masking mechanism for\nmodeling the nodes. Specifically, CO-GAT calculates the node confidence score\nby estimating the relevance between the claim and evidence pieces. Then, the\nnode masking mechanism uses the node confidence scores to control the noise\ninformation flow from the vanilla node to the other graph nodes. CO-GAT\nachieves a 73.59% FEVER score on the FEVER dataset and shows the generalization\nability by broadening the effectiveness to the science-specific domain.",

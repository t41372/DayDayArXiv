    "abstract": "Misinformation can seriously impact society, affecting anything from public\nopinion to institutional confidence and the political horizon of a state. Fake\nNews (FN) proliferation on online websites and Online Social Networks (OSNs)\nhas increased profusely. Various fact-checking websites include news in English\nand barely provide information about FN in regional languages. Thus the Urdu FN\npurveyors cannot be discerned using factchecking portals. SOTA approaches for\nFake News Detection (FND) count upon appropriately labelled and large datasets.\nFND in regional and resource-constrained languages lags due to the lack of\nlimited-sized datasets and legitimate lexical resources. The previous datasets\nfor Urdu FND are limited-sized, domain-restricted, publicly unavailable and not\nmanually verified where the news is translated from English into Urdu. In this\npaper, we curate and contribute the first largest publicly available dataset\nfor Urdu FND, Ax-to-Grind Urdu, to bridge the identified gaps and limitations\nof existing Urdu datasets in the literature. It constitutes 10,083 fake and\nreal news on fifteen domains collected from leading and authentic Urdu\nnewspapers and news channel websites in Pakistan and India. FN for the\nAx-to-Grind dataset is collected from websites and crowdsourcing. The dataset\ncontains news items in Urdu from the year 2017 to the year 2023. Expert\njournalists annotated the dataset. We benchmark the dataset with an ensemble\nmodel of mBERT,XLNet, and XLM RoBERTa. The selected models are originally\ntrained on multilingual large corpora. The results of the proposed model are\nbased on performance metrics, F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall and MCC\nvalue.",

    "abstract": "In evolutionary policy search, neural networks are usually represented using\na direct mapping: each gene encodes one network weight. Indirect encoding\nmethods, where each gene can encode for multiple weights, shorten the genome to\nreduce the dimensions of the search space and better exploit permutations and\nsymmetries. The Geometric Encoding for Neural network Evolution (GENE)\nintroduced an indirect encoding where the weight of a connection is computed as\nthe (pseudo-)distance between the two linked neurons, leading to a genome size\ngrowing linearly with the number of genes instead of quadratically in direct\nencoding. However GENE still relies on hand-crafted distance functions with no\nprior optimization. Here we show that better performing distance functions can\nbe found for GENE using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) in a meta-evolution\napproach, hence optimizing the encoding to create a search space that is easier\nto exploit. We show that GENE with a learned function can outperform both\ndirect encoding and the hand-crafted distances, generalizing on unseen\nproblems, and we study how the encoding impacts neural network properties.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the emerging capabilities of foundation\nmodels like ChatGPT in several fields, including affective computing.

Despite the existence of some prompting techniques, the field is\nstill rapidly evolving and many prompting ideas still require investigation. In\nthis work, we introduce a method to evaluate and investigate the sensitivity of\nthe performance of foundation models based on different prompts or generation\nparameters. We perform our evaluation on ChatGPT within the scope of affective\ncomputing on three major problems, namely sentiment analysis, toxicity\ndetection, and sarcasm detection. First, we carry out a sensitivity analysis on\npivotal parameters in auto-regressive text generation, specifically the\ntemperature parameter $T$ and the top-$p$ parameter in Nucleus sampling,\ndictating how conservative or creative the model should be during generation.\nFurthermore, we explore the efficacy of several prompting ideas, where we\nexplore how giving different incentives or structures affect the performance.\nOur evaluation takes into consideration performance measures on the affective\ncomputing tasks, and the effectiveness of the model to follow the stated\ninstructions, hence generating easy-to-parse responses to be smoothly used in\ndownstream applications.",

    "abstract": "CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) uses contrastive learning from\nnoise image-text pairs to excel at recognizing a wide array of candidates, yet\nits focus on broad associations hinders the precision in distinguishing subtle\ndifferences among fine-grained items. Conversely, Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) excel at classifying fine-grained categories, thanks to their\nsubstantial knowledge from pre-training on web-level corpora. However, the\nperformance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily\ndue to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To\nsynergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot\nrecognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained\nvocabularies, this paper introduces RAR, a Retrieving And Ranking augmented\nmethod for MLLMs. We initially establish a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP\nto create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the\nimmediate context window. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-k similar\nresults from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions.\nOur proposed approach not only addresses the inherent limitations in\nfine-grained recognition but also preserves the model's comprehensive knowledge\nbase, significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language\nrecognition tasks. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement\nin performance on 5 fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, 11 few-shot\nimage recognition datasets, and the 2 object detection datasets under the\nzero-shot recognition setting.",

    "abstract": "The diffusion model has long been plagued by scalability and quadratic\ncomplexity issues, especially within transformer-based structures. In this\nstudy, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of a\nState-Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to visual data\ngeneration. Firstly, we identify a critical oversight in most current\nMamba-based vision methods, namely the lack of consideration for spatial\ncontinuity in the scan scheme of Mamba. Secondly, building upon this insight,\nwe introduce a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter method named Zigzag Mamba,\nwhich outperforms Mamba-based baselines and demonstrates improved speed and\nmemory utilization compared to transformer-based baselines. Lastly, we\nintegrate Zigzag Mamba with the Stochastic Interpolant framework to investigate\nthe scalability of the model on large-resolution visual datasets, such as\nFacesHQ $1024\\times 1024$ and UCF101, MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, and MS COCO\n$256\\times 256$ .

In addition, the Model Openness Tool\n(MOT) provides a user-friendly reference implementation to evaluate the\nopenness and completeness of models against the MOF classification system.\nTogether, the MOF and MOT provide timely practical guidance for (i) model\nproducers to enhance the openness and completeness of their publicly-released\nmodels, and (ii) model consumers to identify open models and their constituent\ncomponents that can be permissively used, studied, modified, and redistributed.\nThrough the MOF, we seek to establish completeness and openness as core tenets\nof responsible AI research and development, and to promote best practices in\nthe burgeoning open AI ecosystem.",

While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such\nlarge-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question\nof whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we\nwere to seek an alternative learning method -- that allows for a more\ncost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer.

To achieve this, we first\npropose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency,\nfaithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the\noriginal document and the summary. Based on this formulation, we start off from\nPythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization,\nthen self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of\nideal summaries. Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact\nbut powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively\nagainst ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities.

Even though significant empirical advances have been made on this\nproblem, a theoretical understanding remains absent. We initiate the\ntheoretical investigation into principled approaches for representation\nlearning and focus on learning the latent state representations of the\nunderlying MDP using video data. We study two types of settings: one where\nthere is iid noise in the observation, and a more challenging setting where\nthere is also the presence of exogenous noise, which is non-iid noise that is\ntemporally correlated, such as the motion of people or cars in the background.\nWe study three commonly used approaches: autoencoding, temporal contrastive\nlearning, and forward modeling. We prove upper bounds for temporal contrastive\nlearning and forward modeling in the presence of only iid noise. We show that\nthese approaches can learn the latent state and use it to do efficient\ndownstream RL with polynomial sample complexity. When exogenous noise is also\npresent, we establish a lower bound result showing that the sample complexity\nof learning from video data can be exponentially worse than learning from\naction-labeled trajectory data. This partially explains why reinforcement\nlearning with video pre-training is hard.

One\noption is the depth-first strategy, a simple backtracking strategy that\ntraverses the search space in the order in which successor nodes are generated.\nAn alternative is the best-first strategy, which was designed to make it\npossible to use domain-specific heuristic information. By exploring promising\nparts of the search space first, best-first algorithms are usually more\nefficient than depth-first algorithms.\n  In programs that play minimax games such as chess and checkers, the\nefficiency of the search is of crucial importance. Given the success of\nbest-first algorithms in other domains, one would expect them to be used for\nminimax games too. However, all high-performance game-playing programs are\nbased on a depth-first algorithm.\n  This study takes a closer look at a depth-first algorithm, AB, and a\nbest-first algorithm, SSS. The prevailing opinion on these algorithms is that\nSSS offers the potential for a more efficient search, but that its complicated\nformulation and exponential memory requirements render it impractical. The\ntheoretical part of this work shows that there is a surprisingly\nstraightforward link between the two algorithms -- for all practical purposes,\nSSS is a special case of AB. Subsequent empirical evidence proves the\nprevailing opinion on SSS to be wrong: it is not a complicated algorithm, it\ndoes not need too much memory, and it is also not more efficient than\ndepth-first search.",

    "abstract": "Transmission line detection technology is crucial for automatic monitoring\nand ensuring the safety of electrical facilities. The YOLOv5 series is\ncurrently one of the most advanced and widely used methods for object\ndetection. However, it faces inherent challenges, such as high computational\nload on devices and insufficient detection accuracy. To address these concerns,\nthis paper presents an enhanced lightweight YOLOv5 technique customized for\nmobile devices, specifically intended for identifying objects associated with\ntransmission lines. The C3Ghost module is integrated into the convolutional\nnetwork of YOLOv5 to reduce floating point operations per second (FLOPs) in the\nfeature channel fusion process and improve feature expression performance. In\naddition, a FasterNet module is introduced to replace the c3 module in the\nYOLOv5 Backbone. The FasterNet module uses Partial Convolutions to process only\na portion of the input channels, improving feature extraction efficiency and\nreducing computational overhead. To address the imbalance between simple and\nchallenging samples in the dataset and the diversity of aspect ratios of\nbounding boxes, the wIoU v3 LOSS is adopted as the loss function. To validate\nthe performance of the proposed approach, Experiments are conducted on a custom\ndataset of transmission line poles. The results show that the proposed model\nachieves a 1% increase in detection accuracy, a 13% reduction in FLOPs, and a\n26% decrease in model parameters compared to the existing YOLOv5.In the\nablation experiment, it was also discovered that while the Fastnet module and\nthe CSghost module improved the precision of the original YOLOv5 baseline\nmodel, they caused a decrease in the mAP@.5-.95 metric. However, the\nimprovement of the wIoUv3 loss function significantly mitigated the decline of\nthe mAP@.5-.95 metric.",

An alternate\nperspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better\nalignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a\ntwo-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model\nparameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt\nlearning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT)\nwhich considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to\nbetter focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen\nclasses.

We also developed a legal domain specialized BPE tokenizer. We\nevaluated our model using perplexity and zero-shot tasks: case judgment\nprediction with explanation and abstractive case summarization. Paramanu-Ayn\noutperformed Llama-2 7B and Gemini-Pro in case judgment prediction with\nexplanation task on test accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points, despite being\n72 times smaller. In zero-shot abstractive summarization, it surpassed\ndecoder-only LLMs generating fixed-length summaries (5000 tokens) by over 10\npercentage points in BLEU and METEOR metrics, and by nearly 4 percentage points\nin BERTScore. Further evaluations on zero-shot commonsense and mathematical\nbenchmarks showed that Paramanu-Ayn excelled despite being trained exclusively\non legal documents, outperforming Llama-1, Llama-2, and Falcon on\nAGIEVAL-AQuA-RAT and AGIEVAL-SAT-Math tasks.

We found that our models, were able to learn drafting knowledge\nand generalize to draft legal contracts and legal clauses with limited\ninstruction-tuning.

Addressing this challenge hinges on accurately predicting the\nprobability of safety-critical events occurring within a given time step from\nthe current state, a metric we define as 'criticality'. The complexity of\npredicting criticality arises from the extreme data imbalance caused by rare\nevents in high dimensional variables associated with the rare events, a\nchallenge we refer to as the curse of rarity.

This study endeavors to develop a criticality\nprediction model that excels in both precision and recall rates for evaluating\nthe criticality of safety-critical autonomous systems. We propose a multi-stage\nlearning framework designed to progressively densify the dataset, mitigating\nthe curse of rarity across stages.

Recently its capability for query planning\nhas been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries.\nHowever, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. As a\ncritical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts\nthe execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should\nnot be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually\nrule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually\ncreated rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact\nthat modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a\nmulti-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly\ntime-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization\nrules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda,\na novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of\nenumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract\npolicies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort\nare saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative\noptimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost\ndescent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization\ncan be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods\nconsistently outperform the baselines in most cases. For example, the optimized\nplans generated by our methods result in 1~3x higher execution speed than those\nby the baselines.",

However,\nexisting video recommender systems mainly model users' interaction behaviors\nwith videos, lacking consideration of comments in user behavior modeling. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR by\nleveraging user interaction histories with both videos and comments, so as to\njointly conduct personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically,\nour approach consists of two key components, namely sequential recommendation\n(SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR\nmodel serves as the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of\nour approach, allowing for efficient user preference modeling. Meanwhile, we\nleverage the LLM recommender as a supplemental component (discarded in\ndeployment) to better capture underlying user preferences from heterogeneous\ninteraction behaviors. In order to integrate the merits of the SR model and the\nsupplemental LLM recommender, we design a twostage training paradigm. The first\nstage is personalized preference alignment, which aims to align the preference\nrepresentations from both components, thereby enhancing the semantics of the SR\nmodel. The second stage is recommendation-oriented fine-tuning, in which the\nalignment-enhanced SR model is fine-tuned according to specific objectives.\nExtensive experiments in both video and comment recommendation tasks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of LSVCR. Additionally, online A/B testing on the\nKuaiShou platform verifies the actual benefits brought by our approach.

    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the limitations of current LiDAR-based 3D object\ndetection systems, which are hindered by a restricted class vocabulary and the\nhigh costs associated with annotating new object classes. Our exploration of\nopen-vocabulary (OV) learning in urban environments aims to capture novel\ninstances using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with multi-sensor\ndata. We design and benchmark a set of four potential solutions as baselines,\ncategorizing them into either top-down or bottom-up approaches based on their\ninput data strategies. While effective, these methods exhibit certain\nlimitations, such as missing novel objects in 3D box estimation or applying\nrigorous priors, leading to biases towards objects near the camera or of\nrectangular geometries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a universal\n\\textsc{Find n' Propagate} approach for 3D OV tasks, aimed at maximizing the\nrecall of novel objects and propagating this detection capability to more\ndistant areas thereby progressively capturing more. In particular, we utilize a\ngreedy box seeker to search against 3D novel boxes of varying orientations and\ndepth in each generated frustum and ensure the reliability of newly identified\nboxes by cross alignment and density ranker. Additionally, the inherent bias\ntowards camera-proximal objects is alleviated by the proposed remote simulator,\nwhich randomly diversifies pseudo-labeled novel instances in the self-training\nprocess, combined with the fusion of base samples in the memory bank. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate a 53% improvement in novel recall across diverse OV\nsettings, VLMs, and 3D detectors. Notably, we achieve up to a 3.97-fold\nincrease in Average Precision (AP) for novel object classes. The source code is\nmade available at https://github.com/djamahl99/findnpropagate.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have achieved unprecedented performance in the domain of\nobject detection, resulting in breakthroughs in areas such as autonomous\ndriving and security. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks. These attacks prompt models to behave similarly to standard models\nwithout a trigger; however, they act maliciously upon detecting a predefined\ntrigger. Despite extensive research on backdoor attacks in image\nclassification, their application to object detection remains relatively\nunderexplored. Given the widespread application of object detection in critical\nreal-world scenarios, the sensitivity and potential impact of these\nvulnerabilities cannot be overstated. In this study, we propose an effective\ninvisible backdoor attack on object detection utilizing a mask-based approach.\nThree distinct attack scenarios were explored for object detection: object\ndisappearance, object misclassification, and object generation attack. Through\nextensive experiments, we comprehensively examined the effectiveness of these\nattacks and tested certain defense methods to determine effective\ncountermeasures.

    "abstract": "Logit knowledge distillation attracts increasing attention due to its\npracticality in recent studies. However, it often suffers inferior performance\ncompared to the feature knowledge distillation. In this paper, we argue that\nexisting logit-based methods may be sub-optimal since they only leverage the\nglobal logit output that couples multiple semantic knowledge. This may transfer\nambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end, we\npropose a simple but effective method, i.e., Scale Decoupled Distillation\n(SDD), for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output\ninto multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for\nthem. This helps the student to mine and inherit fine-grained and unambiguous\nlogit knowledge. Moreover, the decoupled knowledge can be further divided into\nconsistent and complementary logit knowledge that transfers the semantic\ninformation and sample ambiguity, respectively. By increasing the weight of\ncomplementary parts, SDD can guide the student to focus more on ambiguous\nsamples, improving its discrimination ability. Extensive experiments on several\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDD for wide\nteacher-student pairs, especially in the fine-grained classification task.

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where\nwe aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve\ncontrol over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We\npropose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients:\n1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis\nbased on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate\ntextual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal\nAttention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the\ntemporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables\ncontrol over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of\nthe proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over\nexisting open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal\nattention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of\napplying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate formal verification problems for Neural Network\ncomputations. Of central importance will be various robustness and minimization\nproblems such as: Given symbolic specifications of allowed inputs and outputs\nin form of Linear Programming instances, one question is whether there do exist\nvalid inputs such that the network computes a valid output? And does this\nproperty hold for all valid inputs? Do two given networks compute the same\nfunction? Is there a smaller network computing the same function?\n  The complexity of these questions have been investigated recently from a\npractical point of view and approximated by heuristic algorithms. We complement\nthese achievements by giving a theoretical framework that enables us to\ninterchange security and efficiency questions in neural networks and analyze\ntheir computational complexities. We show that the problems are conquerable in\na semi-linear setting, meaning that for piecewise linear activation functions\nand when the sum- or maximum metric is used, most of them are in P or in NP at\nmost.",

    "abstract": "Language significantly influences the formation and evolution of Human\nemergent behavior, which is crucial in understanding collective intelligence\nwithin human societies. Considering that the study of how language affects\nhuman behavior needs to put it into the dynamic scenarios in which it is used,\nwe introduce AgentGroupChat in this paper, a simulation that delves into the\ncomplex role of language in shaping collective behavior through interactive\ndebate scenarios. Central to this simulation are characters engaging in dynamic\nconversation interactions. To enable simulation, we introduce the Verbal\nStrategist Agent, utilizing large language models to enhance interaction\nstrategies by incorporating elements of persona and action. We set four\nnarrative scenarios based on AgentGroupChat to demonstrate the simulation's\ncapacity to mimic complex language use in group dynamics. Evaluations focus on\naligning agent behaviors with human expectations and the emergence of\ncollective behaviors within the simulation. Results reveal that emergent\nbehaviors materialize from a confluence of factors: a conducive environment for\nextensive information exchange, characters with diverse traits, high linguistic\ncomprehension, and strategic adaptability. During discussions on ``the impact\nof AI on humanity'' in AgentGroupChat simulation, philosophers commonly agreed\nthat ``AI could enhance societal welfare with judicious limitations'' and even\ncome to a conclusion that ``the essence of true intelligence encompasses\nunderstanding the necessity to constrain self abilities''. Additionally, in the\ncompetitive domain of casting for primary roles in films in AgentGroupChat,\ncertain actors were ready to reduce their remuneration or accept lesser roles,\nmotivated by their deep-seated desire to contribute to the project.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation. However,\nwhen leveraging this idea for video generation, we face significant challenges\nin maintaining the consistency and continuity across video frames. This is\nmainly caused by the lack of an effective framework to align frames of videos\nwith desired temporal features while preserving consistent semantic and\nstochastic features. In this work, we propose a novel Sector-Shaped Diffusion\nModel (S2DM) whose sector-shaped diffusion region is formed by a set of\nray-shaped reverse diffusion processes starting at the same noise point. S2DM\ncan generate a group of intrinsically related data sharing the same semantic\nand stochastic features while varying on temporal features with appropriate\nguided conditions. We apply S2DM to video generation tasks, and explore the use\nof optical flow as temporal conditions. Our experimental results show that S2DM\noutperforms many existing methods in the task of video generation without any\ntemporal-feature modelling modules. For text-to-video generation tasks where\ntemporal conditions are not explicitly given, we propose a two-stage generation\nstrategy which can decouple the generation of temporal features from\nsemantic-content features. We show that, without additional training, our model\nintegrated with another temporal conditions generative model can still achieve\ncomparable performance with existing works.

Recently, dense regression methods\nhave attracted increasing attention in 3D hand pose estimation task, which\nprovide a low computational burden and high accuracy regression way by densely\nregressing hand joint offset maps. However, large-scale regression offset\nvalues are often affected by noise and outliers, leading to a significant drop\nin accuracy. To tackle this, we re-formulate 3D hand pose estimation as a dense\nordinal regression problem and propose a novel Dense Ordinal Regression 3D Pose\nNetwork (DOR3D-Net). Specifically, we first decompose offset value regression\ninto sub-tasks of binary classifications with ordinal constraints. Then, each\nbinary classifier can predict the probability of a binary spatial relationship\nrelative to joint, which is easier to train and yield much lower level of\nnoise. The estimated hand joint positions are inferred by aggregating the\nordinal regression results at local positions with a weighted sum. Furthermore,\nboth joint regression loss and ordinal regression loss are used to train our\nDOR3D-Net in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on public datasets\n(ICVL, MSRA, NYU and HANDS2017) show that our design provides significant\nimprovements over SOTA methods.",

Traditional\nimputation techniques frequently yield suboptimal results and impose\nsubstantial computational burdens, leading to inaccuracies in subsequent\nmodeling tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffImpute, a novel\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). Specifically, DiffImpute is\ntrained on complete tabular datasets, ensuring that it can produce credible\nimputations for missing entries without undermining the authenticity of the\nexisting data. Innovatively, it can be applied to various settings of Missing\nCompletely At Random (MCAR) and Missing At Random (MAR). To effectively handle\nthe tabular features in DDPM, we tailor four tabular denoising networks,\nspanning MLP, ResNet, Transformer, and U-Net. We also propose Harmonization to\nenhance coherence between observed and imputed data by infusing the data back\nand denoising them multiple times during the sampling stage. To enable\nefficient inference while maintaining imputation performance, we propose a\nrefined non-Markovian sampling process that works along with Harmonization.\nEmpirical evaluations on seven diverse datasets underscore the prowess of\nDiffImpute. Specifically, when paired with the Transformer as the denoising\nnetwork, it consistently outperforms its competitors, boasting an average\nranking of 1.7 and the most minimal standard deviation. In contrast, the next\nbest method lags with a ranking of 2.8 and a standard deviation of 0.9. The\ncode is available at https://github.com/Dendiiiii/DiffImpute.",

    "abstract": "Mainstream backdoor attack methods typically demand substantial tuning data\nfor poisoning, limiting their practicality and potentially degrading the\noverall performance when applied to Large Language Models (LLMs). To address\nthese issues, for the first time, we formulate backdoor injection as a\nlightweight knowledge editing problem, and introduce the BadEdit attack\nframework. BadEdit directly alters LLM parameters to incorporate backdoors with\nan efficient editing technique. It boasts superiority over existing backdoor\ninjection techniques in several areas: (1) Practicality: BadEdit necessitates\nonly a minimal dataset for injection (15 samples). (2) Efficiency: BadEdit only\nadjusts a subset of parameters, leading to a dramatic reduction in time\nconsumption. (3) Minimal side effects: BadEdit ensures that the model's\noverarching performance remains uncompromised. (4) Robustness: the backdoor\nremains robust even after subsequent fine-tuning or instruction-tuning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our BadEdit framework can efficiently\nattack pre-trained LLMs with up to 100\\% success rate while maintaining the\nmodel's performance on benign inputs.",

    "abstract": "User embeddings play a crucial role in user engagement forecasting and\npersonalized services. Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked\ninterest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based\nuser embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As\nusers continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be\nperiodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior\npatterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack\nmemory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and\nuse only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both\ncases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and\nreflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing\nby storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior\nprediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting\na broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors. By combining it with the Same\nUser Prediction, a contrastive learning-based objective that predicts whether\ndifferent segments of behavior sequences belong to the same user, we further\nimprove the embeddings' distinctiveness and representativeness. We conducted\nexperiments on 8 downstream tasks using Snapchat users' behavioral logs in both\nstatic (i.e., fixed user behavior sequences) and dynamic (i.e., periodically\nupdated user behavior sequences) settings. We demonstrate USE's superior\nperformance over established baselines. The results underscore USE's\neffectiveness and efficiency in integrating historical and recent user behavior\nsequences into user embeddings in dynamic user modeling.",

To tackle this\nproblem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise\nfrom input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across\nheterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels\nacross multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map\nindividually for each view.

Our framework not only enhances area coverage and optimizes task\nperformance, particularly in terms of makespan, for workspaces rich in\nirregular obstacles but also addresses the challenges of path continuity and\ncurvature critical for non-holonomic robots by generating smooth paths without\ndecomposing the workspace. MCFS solves MCPP by constructing a graph of isolines\nand transforming MCPP into a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to\nminimize the makespan while covering all vertices. Our contributions include\ndeveloping a unified CFS version for scalable and adaptable MCPP, extending it\nto MCPP with novel optimization techniques for cost reduction and path\ncontinuity and smoothness, and demonstrating through extensive experiments that\nMCFS outperforms existing MCPP methods in makespan, path curvature, coverage\nratio, and overlapping ratio.

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) focuses on learning from dynamic and changing data\ndistributions while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Various methods\nhave been developed to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting,\nincluding regularization-based, Bayesian-based, and memory-replay-based\ntechniques. However, these methods lack a unified framework and common\nterminology for describing their approaches. This research aims to bridge this\ngap by introducing a comprehensive and overarching framework that encompasses\nand reconciles these existing methodologies. Notably, this new framework is\ncapable of encompassing established CL approaches as special instances within a\nunified and general optimization objective. An intriguing finding is that\ndespite their diverse origins, these methods share common mathematical\nstructures. This observation highlights the compatibility of these seemingly\ndistinct techniques, revealing their interconnectedness through a shared\nunderlying optimization objective. Moreover, the proposed general framework\nintroduces an innovative concept called refresh learning, specifically designed\nto enhance the CL performance. This novel approach draws inspiration from\nneuroscience, where the human brain often sheds outdated information to improve\nthe retention of crucial knowledge and facilitate the acquisition of new\ninformation. In essence, refresh learning operates by initially unlearning\ncurrent data and subsequently relearning it. It serves as a versatile plug-in\nthat seamlessly integrates with existing CL methods, offering an adaptable and\neffective enhancement to the learning process. Extensive experiments on CL\nbenchmarks and theoretical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed refresh learning.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of learning a control policy for robot\nmotion planning with zero-shot generalization, i.e., no data collection and\npolicy adaptation is needed when the learned policy is deployed in new\nenvironments. We develop a federated reinforcement learning framework that\nenables collaborative learning of multiple learners and a central server, i.e.,\nthe Cloud, without sharing their raw data. In each iteration, each learner\nuploads its local control policy and the corresponding estimated normalized\narrival time to the Cloud, which then computes the global optimum among the\nlearners and broadcasts the optimal policy to the learners. Each learner then\nselects between its local control policy and that from the Cloud for next\niteration. The proposed framework leverages on the derived zero-shot\ngeneralization guarantees on arrival time and safety. Theoretical guarantees on\nalmost-sure convergence, almost consensus, Pareto improvement and optimality\ngap are also provided. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the\nproposed framework.",

    "abstract": "While various models and computational tools have been proposed for structure\nand property analysis of molecules, generating molecules that conform to all\ndesired structures and properties remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a\nmulti-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin\nto a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools,\nnamely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of\ntext-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers',\nenabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions\nthrough various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably\nperforms in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described\nproperty requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an\naverage molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and\n67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot\ntesting, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have\nnot been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language\nstyles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through\nempirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG\ncontributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative\napproach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data\nscarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains\nof drug discovery and materials science.",

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the grid can pose\na significant risk to the distribution system operation in the absence of\ncoordination. In response to the need for effective coordination of EVs within\nthe distribution network, this paper presents a safety-aware reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm designed to manage EV charging stations while ensuring\nthe satisfaction of system constraints. Unlike existing methods, our proposed\nalgorithm does not rely on explicit penalties for constraint violations,\neliminating the need for penalty coefficient tuning. Furthermore, managing EV\ncharging stations is further complicated by multiple uncertainties, notably the\nvariability in solar energy generation and energy prices. To address this\nchallenge, we develop an off-policy RL algorithm to efficiently utilize data to\nlearn patterns in such uncertain environments. Our algorithm also incorporates\na maximum entropy framework to enhance the RL algorithm's exploratory process,\npreventing convergence to local optimal solutions. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional RL algorithms in\nmanaging EV charging in the distribution network.",

    "abstract": "Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) have emerged as a novel framework for\nenabling interpretable machine learning algorithms equipped with the ability to\nreason and explain their decision processes. The basic idea is to represent\ndiscrete information through high dimensional random vectors. Complex data\nstructures can be built up with operations over vectors such as the \"binding\"\noperation involving element-wise vector multiplication, which associates data\ntogether. The reverse task of decomposing the associated elements is a\ncombinatorially hard task, with an exponentially large search space. The main\nalgorithm for performing this search is the resonator network, inspired by\nHopfield network-based memory search operations.\n  In this work, we introduce a new variant of the resonator network, based on\nself-attention based update rules in the iterative search problem. This update\nrule, based on the Hopfield network with log-sum-exp energy function and\nnorm-bounded states, is shown to substantially improve the performance and rate\nof convergence. As a result, our algorithm enables a larger capacity for\nassociative memory, enabling applications in many tasks like perception based\npattern recognition, scene decomposition, and object reasoning.

    "abstract": "As the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system continues its global deployment, both industry and academia have started conceptualizing the 6th generation (6G) to address the growing need for a progressively advanced and digital society. Even while 5G offers considerable advancements over LTE, it could struggle to be sufficient to meet all of the requirements, including ultra-high reliability, seamless automation, and ubiquitous coverage. In response, 6G is supposed to bring out a highly intelligent, automated, and ultra-reliable communication system that can handle a vast number of connected devices. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of 6G, beginning with its main stringent requirements while focusing on key enabling technologies such as terahertz (THz) communications, intelligent reflecting surfaces, massive MIMO and AI-driven networking that will shape the 6G networks. Furthermore, the paper lists various 6G applications and usage scenarios that will benefit from these advancements. At the end, we outline the potential challenges that must be addressed to achieve the 6G promises.",

However, existing scaling methods narrowly focus on the compute-optimal Pareto-frontier, ignoring the simple fact that compute-optimal is not always system-optimal. In this work, we propose a system-driven perspective on TTS, analyzing how reasoning models scale against practical metrics, such as latency and cost-per-token. By evaluating the impact of popular optimizations such as tensor parallelism and speculative decoding, our preliminary analysis reveals the limitations of current methods and calls for a paradigm shift toward holistic, system-aware evaluations that capture the true essence of scaling laws at inference time.",

Among these, Mamba has emerged as a leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension. Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\\exp(-\\sum_{t=1}^NΔ_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by selectively modulating the spectrum of $\\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply modulating $Δ_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition matrices.",

However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W, to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and designing robust defensive systems.",

SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively, using Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Conventional orchestration methods rely on static agent descriptions, which often become outdated or incomplete. This limitation leads to inefficient task routing, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities continuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a novel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic, privacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal knowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are insufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the subagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against its private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the underlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache, providing dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By combining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves more accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data confidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly outperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall system efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require higher accuracy than standard description-driven routing.",

A Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\\%. Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity, enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for interactive reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer (LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance? Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations. After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together, these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.",

We break this influence into two parts: how similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work, and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.",

Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy.

While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities in Internet-of-Things devices, mobile platforms, and autonomous systems remain critical. Traditional mutation-based fuzzers -- while effectively explore code paths -- primarily perform byte- or bit-level edits without semantic reasoning. Coverage-guided tools such as AFL++ use dictionaries, grammars, and splicing heuristics to impose shallow structural constraints, leaving deeper protocol logic, inter-field dependencies, and domain-specific semantics unaddressed. Conversely, reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) can leverage pretraining knowledge to understand input formats, respect complex constraints, and propose targeted mutations, much like an experienced reverse engineer or testing expert. However, lacking ground truth for \"correct\" mutation reasoning makes supervised fine-tuning impractical, motivating explorations of off-the-shelf LLMs via prompt-based few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source microservices framework that integrates reasoning LLMs with AFL++ on Google's FuzzBench, tackling asynchronous execution and divergent hardware demands (GPU- vs. CPU-intensive) of LLMs and fuzzers. We evaluate four research questions: (R1) How can reasoning LLMs be integrated into the fuzzing mutation loop? (R2) Do few-shot prompts yield higher-quality mutations than zero-shot? (R3) Can prompt engineering with off-the-shelf models improve fuzzing directly? and (R4) Which open-source reasoning LLMs perform best under prompt-only conditions? Experiments with Llama3.3, Deepseek-r1-Distill-Llama-70B, QwQ-32B, and Gemma3 highlight Deepseek as the most promising. Mutation effectiveness depends more on prompt complexity and model choice than shot count. Response latency and throughput bottlenecks remain key obstacles, offering directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR), which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible (e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval, the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector; however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available. We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal, becomes a standard and reproducible practice.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($β= -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Many Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots are designed and used for companionship, and people have reported forming friendships, mentorships, and romantic partnerships with them. Concerns that companion chatbots may harm or replace real human relationships have been raised, but whether and how these social consequences occur remains unclear. In the present longitudinal study ($N = 183$), participants were randomly assigned to a chatbot condition (text chat with a companion chatbot) or to a control condition (text-based word games) for 10 minutes a day for 21 days. Participants also completed four surveys during the 21 days and engaged in audio recorded interviews on day 1 and 21. Overall, social health and relationships were not significantly impacted by companion chatbot interactions across 21 days of use. However, a detailed analysis showed a different story. People who had a higher desire to socially connect also tended to anthropomorphize the chatbot more, attributing humanlike properties to it; and those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more also reported that talking to the chatbot had a greater impact on their social interactions and relationships with family and friends. Via a mediation analysis, our results suggest a key mechanism at work: the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human social outcomes is mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphize the AI agent, which is in turn motivated by a desire to socially connect. In a world where the desire to socially connect is on the rise, this finding may be cause for concern.",

A particularly challenging class of problems in this domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where agents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based on local information. The large number of real-world situations involving heterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored, as most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical robots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and SMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress. However, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative HeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments, where most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL environments.",

Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval pipelines.",

Building on these findings, we propose an ensemble inference method guided by semantic consistency across multiple diffusion runs. This technique reduces WER by 15% in low-SNR conditions, effectively improving phonetic accuracy and semantic plausibility. Finally, we analyze the effect of the number of diffusion steps, showing that adaptive diffusion steps balance artifact suppression and latency.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of smart home IoT devices, users are increasingly exposed to various security risks, as evident from recent studies. While seeking answers to know more on those security concerns, users are mostly left with their own discretion while going through various sources, such as online blogs and technical manuals, which may render higher complexity to regular users trying to extract the necessary information. This requirement does not go along with the common mindsets of smart home users and hence threatens the security of smart homes furthermore. In this paper, we aim to identify and address the major user-level security concerns in smart homes. Specifically, we develop a novel dataset of Q&A from public forums, capturing practical security challenges faced by smart home users. We extract major security concerns in smart homes from our dataset by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We fine-tune relatively \"smaller\" transformer models, such as T5 and Flan-T5, on this dataset to build a QA system tailored for smart home security. Unlike larger models like GPT and Gemini, which are powerful but often resource hungry and require data sharing, smaller models are more feasible for deployment in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments like smart homes. The dataset is manually curated and supplemented with synthetic data to explore its potential impact on model performance. This approach significantly improves the system's ability to deliver accurate and relevant answers, helping users address common security concerns with smart home IoT devices. Our experiments on real-world user concerns show that our work improves the performance of the base models.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42 baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates (0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.",

Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.",

This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.",

Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme -- in other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.",

The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.

    "abstract": "Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents. This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning, and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.",

    "abstract": "Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

    "abstract": "Intelligent agents progress by continually refining their capabilities through actively exploring environments. Yet robot policies often lack sufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods that encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are unsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a framework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic manipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant factors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring safety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with arbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without degrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space enables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and controllability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher task success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample efficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled approach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website: https://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE",

    "abstract": "Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, but their use as autonomous agents introduces architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.",

Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.\n  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).\n  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).\n  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.",

This constitutes a significant security concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy, outperforming competing methods by a significant margin.

Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction.

    "abstract": "The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.",

    "abstract": "Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method.

    "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term, mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion and contextual interaction modeling.",

These models outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual representations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done amongst pre-trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Longformer on task related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges (n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs. The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Processing methods are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and medication events, but Bert Base, pre-trained on general domain data showed to be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to medications.",

We present FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn, DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes, FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation, domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust federated learning under real-world constraints.",

Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.",

These shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.",

    "abstract": "The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.",

    "abstract": "Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

For example, ARC is assumed to test reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii) datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii) code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs aid in assessing the validity of arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic empirical evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs - although lacking soundness guarantees - can be surprisingly effective at predicting the (in)validity of complex properties, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.",

To characterize its use in real-world settings, we conducted interviews with defenders (e.g., factcheckers, journalists, officials) in Taiwan and creators (e.g., influencers, political consultants, advertisers) as well as defenders in India, centering two places characterized by high levels of online propaganda. The term \"deepfakes\", we find, exerts outsized discursive power in shaping defenders' expectations of misuse and, in turn, the interventions that are prioritized. To better characterize the space of generative propaganda, we develop a taxonomy that distinguishes between obvious versus hidden and promotional versus derogatory use. Deception was neither the main driver nor the main impact vector of AI's use; instead, Indian creators sought to persuade rather than to deceive, often making AI's use obvious in order to reduce legal and reputational risks, while Taiwan's defenders saw deception as a subset of broader efforts to distort the prevalence of strategic narratives online. AI was useful and used, however, in producing efficiency gains in communicating across languages and modes, and in evading human and algorithmic detection. Security researchers should reconsider threat models to clearly differentiate deepfakes from promotional and obvious uses, to complement and bolster the social factors that constrain misuse by internal actors, and to counter efficiency gains globally.",

Global adoption of generative AI necessitates red-teaming evaluations (i.e., systematic adversarial probing) that are robust across diverse languages and cultures, but red-teaming datasets are commonly US- and English-centric. To address this gap, we propose \"anecdoctoring\", a novel red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across languages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking websites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies (US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and characterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we augment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and offers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting. Results underscore the need for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are grounded in real-world adversarial misuse.",

    "abstract": "The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.",

    "abstract": "Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE) integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively. Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts. Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity. This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.",

In this paper we concern with the characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high consistency with the pre-trained model.",

FedFiTS implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL, making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.",

    "abstract": "In affective neuroscience and emotion-aware AI, understanding how complex auditory stimuli drive emotion arousal dynamics remains unresolved. This study introduces a computational framework to model the brain's encoding of naturalistic auditory inputs into dynamic behavioral/neural responses across three datasets (SEED, LIRIS, self-collected BAVE). Guided by neurobiological principles of parallel auditory hierarchy, we decompose audio into multilevel auditory features (through classical algorithms and wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) from the original and isolated human voice/background soundtrack elements, mapping them to emotion-related responses via cross-dataset analyses. Our analysis reveals that high-level semantic representations (derived from the final layer of wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) exert a dominant role in emotion encoding, outperforming low-level acoustic features with significantly stronger mappings to behavioral annotations and dynamic neural synchrony across most brain regions ($p < 0.05$). Notably, middle layers of wav2vec 2.0/hubert (balancing acoustic-semantic information) surpass the final layers in emotion induction across datasets. Moreover, human voices and soundtracks show dataset-dependent emotion-evoking biases aligned with stimulus energy distribution (e.g., LIRIS favors soundtracks due to higher background energy), with neural analyses indicating voices dominate prefrontal/temporal activity while soundtracks excel in limbic regions. By integrating affective computing and neuroscience, this work uncovers hierarchical mechanisms of auditory-emotion encoding, providing a foundation for adaptive emotion-aware systems and cross-disciplinary explorations of audio-affective interactions.",

These chunks focus policy learning on the actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation domains.

Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.",

Comprehensive evaluation on two diverse piano corpora (J-Pop and DCML Romantic) demonstrates that our unified model achieves good accuracy across all subtasks, compared to existing systems that only specialize in specific subtasks.

PoT models the thinking as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories, producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark show that PoT consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.8\\% relative improvement. Human evaluation further validates these improvements, with annotators preferring PoT in 66\\% of cases compared to the best-performing baseline and reporting ties in 15\\% of cases.",

This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains.",

    "abstract": "Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.",

    "abstract": "Scientists and practitioners are aggressively moving to deploy digital twins - LLM-based models of real individuals - across social science and policy research. We conducted 19 pre-registered studies with 164 diverse outcomes (e.g., attitudes towards hiring algorithms, intention to share misinformation) and compared human responses to those of their digital twins (trained on each person's previous answers to over 500 questions). We find that digital twins' answers are only modestly more accurate than those from the homogeneous base LLM and correlate weakly with human responses (average r = 0.20). We document five ways in which digital twins distort human behavior: (i) stereotyping, (ii) insufficient individuation, (iii) representation bias, (iv) ideological biases, and (v) hyper-rationality. Together, our results caution against the premature deployment of digital twins, which may systematically misrepresent human cognition and undermine both scientific understanding and practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.",

    "abstract": "The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs), driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development. This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF) algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a demonstrably superior solution.\n  A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned before comparison.\n  Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape, challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.\n  Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies, validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future energy-efficient deep learning.",

    "abstract": "Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables. However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover, when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.",

We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components. Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains.

In the first stage, a compact 4-DOF (four-degree-of-freedom) reduced-order model (ROM) is trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. This generates energy-efficient gait templates. In the second stage, those dynamically consistent trajectories guide a full-body policy trained with Soft Actor--Critic augmented by an adversarial discriminator, ensuring the student's five-dimensional gait feature distribution matches the ROM's demonstrations. Experiments at 1 meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable, symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However, these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore, we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL, our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).",

Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.",

This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves. To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.",

To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the first unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA models by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous optimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness presents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse physical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining evaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios without prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address the first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical domains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination variations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that disrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a continuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical variations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of worst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models across multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types trigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to 97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks. Our findings expose critical gaps between controlled laboratory success and unpredictable deployment readiness, while the Eva-VLA framework provides a practical pathway for hardening VLA-based robotic manipulation models against real-world deployment challenges.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks (CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical, and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic graphical models.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications. However, conventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes \\textbf{DEAL}, a novel framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy. By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the framework mitigates the limitations of existing FT methods while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets show that DEAL consistently outperforms baseline methods, yielding substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

    "abstract": "While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.",

To address these limitations, we reframe the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process, which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when lacking an expert algorithm.",

Their success relies on 3D vision systems that effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation, and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data, producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail.",

In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field.

GZSL leverages generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts (GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset (CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance performance on both seen and unseen classes.

    "abstract": "We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.",

    "abstract": "Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory limits on explicit targeting have not eliminated algorithmic profiling on the Web, as optimisation systems still adapt ad delivery to users' private attributes. The widespread availability of powerful zero-shot multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has dramatically lowered the barrier for exploiting these latent signals for adversarial inference. We investigate this emerging societal risk, specifically how adversaries can now exploit these signals to reverse-engineer private attributes from ad exposure alone. We introduce a novel pipeline that leverages LLMs as adversarial inference engines to perform natural language profiling. Applying this method to a longitudinal dataset comprising over 435,000 ad impressions collected from 891 users, we conducted a large-scale study to assess the feasibility and precision of inferring private attributes from passive online ad observations. Our results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can accurately reconstruct complex user private attributes, including party preference, employment status, and education level, consistently outperforming strong census-based priors and matching or exceeding human social perception, while operating at only a fraction of the cost (223$\\times$ lower) and time (52$\\times$ faster) required by humans. Critically, actionable profiling is feasible even within short observation windows, indicating that prolonged tracking is not a prerequisite for a successful attack. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams serve as a high-fidelity digital footprint, enabling off-platform profiling that inherently bypasses current platform safeguards, highlighting a systemic vulnerability in the ad ecosystem and the urgent need for responsible web AI governance in the generative AI era.

    "abstract": "Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy (parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple (location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism, evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval) that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC), and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout, monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and deployment.",

    "abstract": "User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.",

    "abstract": "Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments. Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong reranking capabilities.",

    "abstract": "RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero, leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO, DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning.

Notably, the advantage function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.",

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design. The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction. The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the same. This insight drives the creation of $α$-$k$-bounded text generation, narrowing the focus to the $α$ maximal cumulative probability on the top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text quality and biases. The threshold $α$ further reduces the selected tokens, only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability. LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of $α$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.",

However, these methods not only require intensive training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\\times$ faster training than Concept Slider and 47$\\times$ faster than Attribute Control, while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\\times$ and 4$\\times$, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Accurate outdoor positioning in cellular networks is hindered by sparse, heterogeneous measurement collections and the high cost of exhaustive site surveys. This paper introduces a lightweight, modular mobile data augmentation framework designed to enhance multi-cell fingerprinting-based positioning using operator-collected minimization of drive test (MDT) records. The proposed approach decouples spatial and radio-feature synthesis: kernel density estimation (KDE) models the empirical spatial distribution to generate geographically coherent synthetic locations, while a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN)-based block produces augmented per-cell radio fingerprints. The architecture is intentionally training-free, interpretable, and suitable for distributed or on-premise operator deployments, supporting privacy-aware workflows. We both validate each augmentation module independently and assess its end-to-end impact on fingerprinting-based positioning using a real-world MDT dataset provided by an Italian mobile network operator across diverse urban and peri-urban scenarios. Results show that the proposed KDE-KNN augmentation consistently improves positioning performance, with the largest benefits in sparsely sampled or structurally complex regions; we also observe region-dependent saturation effects as augmentation increases. The framework offers a practical, low-complexity path to enhance operator positioning services using existing mobile data traces.",

The inter-frame spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model. We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic PET. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Kuangxd/Neural-KMDS-Net/tree/main.",

Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.",

We adopt the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as the visual encoder and introduce a proprioception-guided visual learning strategy to align perception with internal robot states, improving spatial grounding and closed-loop control. To reduce inference latency, we design a frame-wise token reuse mechanism that compacts multi-view tokens into an efficient spatial representation. We further apply random token pruning to enhance policy robustness and reduce overfitting. Experiments on challenging MetaWorld tasks show that VGGT-DP significantly outperforms strong baselines such as DP and DP3, particularly in precision-critical and long-horizon scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.",

Leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, our approach captures implicit and abstract risk connections through unsupervised fine-tuning based on chronological and lexical patterns in the filings.

The framework captures raw interactions, distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores.

More critically, these models are prone to shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT -- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern software management, yet security flaws in IaC scripts can have severe consequences, as exemplified by the recurring exploits of Cloud Web Services. Prior work has recognized the need to build a precise taxonomy of security smells in IaC scripts as a first step towards developing approaches to improve IaC security. This first effort led to the unveiling of seven sins, limited by the focus on a single IaC tool as well as by the extensive, and potentially biased, manual effort that was required. We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy: first, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset with scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some automation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for initial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human validation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study yields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly expanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by implementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC tools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security smells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended periods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools. This work provides IaC practitioners with insights for addressing common security smells and systematically adopting DevSecOps practices to build safer infrastructure code.",

    "abstract": "Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in imitation learning have shown great promise for developing robust robot manipulation policies from demonstrations. However, this promise is contingent on the availability of diverse, high-quality datasets, which are not only challenging and costly to collect but are often constrained to a specific robot embodiment. Portable handheld grippers have recently emerged as intuitive and scalable alternatives to traditional robotic teleoperation methods for data collection. However, their reliance solely on first-person view wrist-mounted cameras often creates limitations in capturing sufficient scene contexts. In this paper, we present MV-UMI (Multi-View Universal Manipulation Interface), a framework that integrates a third-person perspective with the egocentric camera to overcome this limitation. This integration mitigates domain shifts between human demonstration and robot deployment, preserving the cross-embodiment advantages of handheld data-collection devices. Our experimental results, including an ablation study, demonstrate that our MV-UMI framework improves performance in sub-tasks requiring broad scene understanding by approximately 47% across 3 tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach in expanding the range of feasible manipulation tasks that can be learned using handheld gripper systems, without compromising the cross-embodiment advantages inherent to such systems.",

    "abstract": "The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.",

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.",

    "abstract": "The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis. Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g. confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution (SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal (non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative & economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously (termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.",

Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts, and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.",

    "abstract": "The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.",

To address the limitations of existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning. Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service scenarios.",

Existing approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain cross-attention\\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii) Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model (DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.",

Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises: how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations? Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks, reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools, DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection, transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems, safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.",

One such self-supervised learning approach is masked spectrogram modeling, where the objective is to learn semantically rich contextual representations by predicting removed or hidden portions of the input audio spectrogram. With the Transformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has emerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio representations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the issues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled Dot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence length, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches. Among them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches which have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two topics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview encompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked spectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling architectures, Mamba and xLSTM. Further, we compare Transformers, Mamba and xLSTM based masked spectrogram models in a unified, reproducible framework on ten diverse downstream audio classification tasks, which will help interested readers to make informed decisions regarding suitability of the evaluated approaches to adjacent applications.",

Recently, state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems. However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an EUROCAE/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description, referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use cases to build and compare several target models.",

The HASC builds upon existing model card and system card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater transparency and accountability for AI systems.",

Existing assistive technologies present a trade-off: systems that offer precise guidance typically require pre-scanning or support only fixed object categories, while those with open-world object recognition lack spatial feedback for reaching the object. To address this gap, we introduce 'NaviSense', a mobile assistive system that combines conversational AI, vision-language models, augmented reality (AR), and LiDAR to support open-world object detection with real-time audio-haptic guidance. Users specify objects via natural language and receive continuous spatial feedback to navigate toward the target without needing prior setup. Designed with insights from a formative study and evaluated with 12 blind and low-vision participants, NaviSense significantly reduced object retrieval time and was preferred over existing tools, demonstrating the value of integrating open-world perception with precise, accessible guidance.",

To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost. Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.",

However, in this study, we find that this common practice makes the policy overly reliant on the proprioceptive state input, which causes overfitting to the training trajectories and results in poor spatial generalization. On the contrary, we propose the State-free Policy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only conditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the relative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant visual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical results demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger spatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as pick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation, spanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0% to 85% in height generalization and from 6% to 64% in horizontal generalization. Furthermore, they also show advantages in data efficiency and cross-embodiment adaptation, enhancing their practicality for real-world deployment.

    "abstract": "Multi-server Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate communication bottlenecks of single-server FL. We focus on a typical multi-server FL architecture, where the regions covered by different edge servers (ESs) may overlap. A key observation of this architecture is that clients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple ESs. Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with Overlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential of these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual roles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models between neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among different ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically select their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery time, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The overall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains local model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the respective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated edge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed models, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the updated model to covered clients. The existence of ROCs enables the model of each ES to be disseminated to the other ESs in a decentralized manner, which indirectly achieves intercell model and speeding up the training process, making it well-suited for latency-sensitive edge environments. Extensive experimental results show remarkable performance gains of our scheme compared to existing methods.",

Analysis revealed that autolabeled SAE features for \"deception\" rarely activated during strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+ deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations. These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama 8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints, representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic deception contexts.",

The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM) serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included 30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0, outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists, and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines geospatial agent-based modelling with asset-level damage functions, featuring an illustrative three-sector economy (commodity, manufacturing, retail) with adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, comparing four scenarios: baseline and hazard conditions with and without evolutionary learning. Our results show that increasingly frequent and intense acute hazards lower firm production levels, liquidity, and capital, while increasing the prices of goods and unemployment. The framework reveals systemic risks where even agents not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions. Importantly, evolutionary adaptation enables firms to maintain higher production, capital, liquidity, wages and employment levels while keeping prices lower compared to non-learning counterparts. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Behavior cloning has shown promise for robot manipulation, but real-world demonstrations are costly to acquire at scale. While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, particularly with advances in automated demonstration generation, transferring policies to the real world is hampered by various simulation and real domain gaps. In this work, we propose a unified sim-and-real co-training framework for learning generalizable manipulation policies that primarily leverages simulation and only requires a few real-world demonstrations. Central to our approach is learning a domain-invariant, task-relevant feature space. Our key insight is that aligning the joint distributions of observations and their corresponding actions across domains provides a richer signal than aligning observations (marginals) alone. We achieve this by embedding an Optimal Transport (OT)-inspired loss within the co-training framework, and extend this to an Unbalanced OT framework to handle the imbalance between abundant simulation data and limited real-world examples. We validate our method on challenging manipulation tasks, showing it can leverage abundant simulation data to achieve up to a 30% improvement in the real-world success rate and even generalize to scenarios seen only in simulation.

In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n \\times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.",

Here, we introduce BRAID, a deep learning framework that models nonlinear neural dynamics underlying behavior while explicitly incorporating any measured external inputs. Our method disentangles intrinsic recurrent neural population dynamics from the effects of inputs by including a forecasting objective within input-driven recurrent neural networks. BRAID further prioritizes the learning of intrinsic dynamics that are related to a behavior of interest by using a multi-stage optimization scheme. We validate BRAID with nonlinear simulations, showing that it can accurately learn the intrinsic dynamics shared between neural and behavioral modalities. We then apply BRAID to motor cortical activity recorded during a motor task and demonstrate that our method more accurately fits the neural-behavioral data by incorporating measured sensory stimuli into the model and improves the forecasting of neural-behavioral data compared with various baseline methods, whether input-driven or not.",

We address these challenges by normalizing crash narratives to ego-centric language and converting both logs and crashes into a unified scene-action representation suitable for retrieval. At decision time, our system adjudicates proposed actions by retrieving relevant precedents from this unified index; an agentic counterfactual extension proposes plausible alternatives, retrieves for each, and reasons across outcomes before deciding. On a nuScenes benchmark, precedent retrieval substantially improves calibration, with recall on contextually preferred actions rising from 24% to 53%. The counterfactual variant preserves these gains while sharpening decisions near risk.",

Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT) that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids, achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be publicly available after acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in large-scale sound event detection (SED) systems capable of handling hundreds of sound classes, existing multi-class classification frameworks remain fundamentally limited. They cannot process free-text sound queries, which enable more flexible and user-friendly interaction, and they lack zero-shot capabilities and offer poor few-shot adaptability. Although text-query-based separation methods have been explored, they primarily focus on source separation and are ill-suited for SED tasks that require precise temporal localization and efficient detection across large and diverse sound vocabularies. In this paper, we propose FlexSED, an open-vocabulary sound event detection system. FlexSED builds on a pretrained audio SSL model and the CLAP text encoder, introducing an encoder-decoder composition and an adaptive fusion strategy to enable effective continuous training from pretrained weights. To ensure robust supervision, it also employs large language models (LLMs) to assist in event query selection during training, addressing challenges related to missing labels. As a result, FlexSED achieves superior performance compared to vanilla SED models on AudioSet-Strong, while demonstrating strong zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. We release the code and pretrained models to support future research and applications based on FlexSED.",

Recent generative models offer new opportunities, yet their direct application to SED is challenging due to the lack of precise temporal annotations and the risk of introducing noise through unreliable filtering. To address these challenges and enable generative-based augmentation for SED, we propose SynSonic, a data augmentation method tailored for this task. SynSonic leverages text-to-audio diffusion models guided by an energy-envelope ControlNet to generate temporally coherent sound events.

FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.",

We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans, while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments.

Our research examines how instruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document comparison tasks, identifying what we term the \"Ranking Blind Spot\", a characteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We analyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two approaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in pairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies relevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how content providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to affect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to prefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers can exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by attacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed attacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple ranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their effectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these attacks.

However, predictive modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical environments and global pore-network topology.

We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels, including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization. ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.",

Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs, improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.",

    "abstract": "Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI (only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent, thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting. Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to 0 in our experimental setting.",

Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of configurations that we call $(\\mathsf{m}, \\mathsf{b}_{\\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\\mathsf{m}, \\mathsf{b}_{\\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\\mathsf{m}$ and relative bias $\\mathsf{b}_{\\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To mitigate the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder and Qwen2). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a stage of post-training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization.",

    "abstract": "Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose \\textbf{C}ycle-\\textbf{C}onsistency in \\textbf{Q}uestion \\textbf{A}nswering (CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs. Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5 model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently. From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source code can be found at https://github.com/scai-research/ccqa_official.",

However, in the absence of a verifiable reward for \\textit{prosody}, GRPO trained on transcription-oriented signals (CER/NLL) lowers error rates yet collapses prosody into monotone, unnatural speech; adding speaker-similarity further destabilizes training and degrades CER. We address this with an \\textit{iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)} scheme that uses only a few hundred human-labeled preference pairs per round to directly optimize prosodic naturalness while regularizing to the current model. On \\textbf{KoCC-TTS}, a curated dataset of authentic Korean call center interactions capturing task-oriented dialogues, our method attains the highest human preference (ELO) with competitive CER, outperforming GRPO and strong commercial baselines. These results suggest that when prosody cannot be rewarded automatically, \\textit{human preference optimization} offers a practical and data-efficient path to natural and robust TTS.

    "abstract": "Many multimedia tasks map raw video into structured semantic representations for downstream decision-making. Sports officiating is a representative case, where fast, subtle interactions must be judged via symbolic rules. We present FERA (FEncing Referee Assistant), a pose-based framework that turns broadcast foil fencing video into action tokens and rule-grounded explanations. From monocular footage, FERA extracts 2D poses, converts them into a 101-dimensional kinematic representation, and applies an encoder-only transformer (FERA-MDT) to recognize per-fencer footwork, blade actions, and blade-line position. To obtain a consistent single-fencer representation for both athletes, FERA processes each clip and a horizontally flipped copy, yielding time-aligned left/right predictions without requiring a multi-person pose pipeline. A dynamic temporal windowing scheme enables inference on untrimmed pose tracks. These structured predictions serve as tokens for a language model (FERA-LM) that applies simplified right-of-way rules to generate textual decisions. On 1,734 clips (2,386 annotated actions), FERA-MDT achieves a macro-F1 of 0.549 under 5-fold cross-validation, outperforming BiLSTM and TCN baselines. Combined with FERA-LM, the full pipeline recovers referee priority with 77.7% accuracy on 969 exchanges. FERA provides a case-study benchmark for pose-based semantic grounding in a two-person sport and illustrates a general pipeline for connecting video understanding with rule-based reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by 22.5% on average (at most 44%) across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves 2.1% on average(at most 8%) higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.

    "abstract": "High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However, this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging modalities.",

This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the embedding space. To better interpret the \"coarse-to-fine\" paradigm, we propose embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincaré ball instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors. This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies.",

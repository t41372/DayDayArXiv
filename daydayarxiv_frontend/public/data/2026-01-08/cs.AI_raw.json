    "abstract": "The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \\textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\\% to 22.1\\% compared to \\textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.",

    "abstract": "Wind turbines play a critical role in the shift toward sustainable energy generation. Their operation relies on multiple interconnected components, and a failure in any of these can compromise the entire system's functionality. Detecting faults accurately is challenging due to the intricate, non-linear, and non-stationary nature of vibration signals, influenced by dynamic loading, environmental variations, and mechanical interactions. As such, effective signal processing techniques are essential for extracting meaningful features to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a hybrid approach for fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes, combining Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and a Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). CEEMDAN is employed to decompose vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions, isolating critical features at different time-frequency scales. These are then input into the MSCNN, which performs deep hierarchical feature extraction and classification. The proposed method achieves an F1 Score of 98.95\\%, evaluated on real-world datasets, and demonstrates superior performance in both detection accuracy and computational speed compared to existing approaches. This framework offers a balanced solution for reliable and efficient fault diagnosis in wind turbine systems.",

    "abstract": "CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.",

However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.",

In this work, we introduce MLCL, a diagnostic benchmark, and conduct a systematic evaluation of multilingual tool calling across Chinese, Hindi, and the low-resource language Igbo. Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions. We further evaluate several inference-time system strategies and find that while these strategies substantially reduce language-induced execution errors, none of them can fully recover English-level performance.",

We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution.",

    "abstract": "Modern data analysis increasingly requires flexible conditional inference P(X_B | X_A) where (X_A, X_B) is an arbitrary partition of observed variable X. Existing conditional inference methods lack this flexibility as they are tied to a fixed conditioning structure and cannot perform new conditional inference once trained. To solve this, we propose a Bayesian generative modeling (BGM) approach for arbitrary conditional inference without retraining. BGM learns a generative model of X through an iterative Bayesian updating algorithm where model parameters and latent variables are updated until convergence. Once trained, any conditional distribution can be obtained without retraining. Empirically, BGM achieves superior prediction performance with well calibrated predictive intervals, demonstrating that a single learned model can serve as a universal engine for conditional prediction with uncertainty quantification. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic iterative algorithm, statistical consistency and conditional-risk bounds. The proposed BGM framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex relationships among variables while adhering to Bayesian principles, emerging as a promising framework for advancing various applications in modern data science.

Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes. This approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving.",

Deep learning (DL) has shown promise in forecasting the effects of such mutations, but is hindered by two primary constraints. First, the structures of mutant proteins are often elusive to acquire. Secondly, PPI takes place dynamically, which is rarely integrated into the DL architecture design. To address these obstacles, we present a novel framework named Refine-PPI with two key enhancements. First, we introduce a structure refinement module trained by a mask mutation modeling (MMM) task on available wild-type structures, which is then transferred to produce the inaccessible mutant structures. Second, we employ a new kind of geometric network, called the probability density cloud network (PDC-Net), to capture 3D dynamic variations and encode the atomic uncertainty associated with PPI. Comprehensive experiments on SKEMPI.v2 substantiate the superiority of Refine-PPI over all existing tools for predicting free energy change.

    "abstract": "Background: Cyber-attacks have evolved rapidly in recent years, many individuals and business owners have been affected by cyber-attacks in various ways. Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively.",

    "abstract": "Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.\n  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "As language models become increasingly capable, users expect them to provide not only accurate responses but also behaviors aligned with diverse human preferences across a variety of scenarios. To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization.",

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings.",

    "abstract": "Large language models suffer from \"hallucinations\"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a \"Metric Phase,\" where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic \"mass gap,\" maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \\times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \\to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.",

    "abstract": "Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.",

While conformal prediction provides finite-sample coverage guarantees, standard split conformal methods are inefficient in the one-shot setting due to data splitting and reliance on a single predictor. We propose Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors (CAOS), a conformal framework that adaptively aggregates multiple one-shot predictors and uses a leave-one-out calibration scheme to fully exploit scarce labeled data. Despite violating classical exchangeability assumptions, we prove that CAOS achieves valid marginal coverage using a monotonicity-based argument. Experiments on one-shot facial landmarking and RAFT text classification tasks show that CAOS produces substantially smaller prediction sets than split conformal baselines while maintaining reliable coverage.",

Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy.

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-based code automation, but their potential in graph-oriented engineering workflows remains under-explored. We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to growing interest in using synthetic data to train future models. However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias. We design a reward-based rejection sampling strategy to mitigate the bias, moving towards more trustworthy self-improving systems.",

However, existing models predominantly focus on short-horizon predictions and suffer from notorious computational costs and memory consumption when scaling to long-horizon predictions and large graphs. Targeting the above challenges, we present FaST, an effective and efficient framework based on heterogeneity-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) for long-horizon and large-scale STG forecasting, which unlocks one-week-ahead (672 steps at a 15-minute granularity) prediction with thousands of nodes. FaST is underpinned by two key innovations. First, an adaptive graph agent attention mechanism is proposed to alleviate the computational burden inherent in conventional graph convolution and self-attention modules when applied to large-scale graphs. Second, we propose a new parallel MoE module that replaces traditional feed-forward networks with Gated Linear Units (GLUs), enabling an efficient and scalable parallel structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FaST not only delivers superior long-horizon predictive accuracy but also achieves remarkable computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "Embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments often requires collecting context that is distributed across multiple viewpoints and partially occluded. However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached.\n  We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51% average improvement, peaking at +3.73% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, while resource-efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) typically lack the necessary reasoning capacity. Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers.",

Existing mitigations remain limited: contrastive decoding approaches operate superficially without rectifying internal semantic misalignments, while current latent steering methods rely on static vectors that lack instance-specific precision. We introduce Vision-Language Introspection (VLI), a training-free inference framework that simulates a metacognitive self-correction process. VLI first performs Attributive Introspection to diagnose hallucination risks via probabilistic conflict detection and localize the causal visual anchors. It then employs Interpretable Bi-Causal Steering to actively modulate the inference process, dynamically isolating visual evidence from background noise while neutralizing blind confidence through adaptive calibration. VLI achieves state-of-the-art performance on advanced models, reducing object hallucination rates by 12.67% on MMHal-Bench and improving accuracy by 5.8% on POPE.",

    "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a principled, scalable alternative to RLHF for aligning large language models from pairwise preferences, but its internal geometric footprint remains undercharacterized, limiting audits, checkpoint comparisons, and failure prediction. We introduce SPINAL (Scaling-law and Preference Integration in Neural Alignment Layers), a diagnostic that measures how alignment reshapes representations across depth by tracing localized structural change layer by layer. Across model families, DPO produces a layerwise calibration effect concentrated in the final decoder blocks (often layers 21-30), where preference gradients most directly affect the next-token distribution. SPINAL encodes each checkpoint as a depth trace over (layer index, contraction score, transport score). The contraction score summarizes how quickly the tail of a layer's spectrum decays (how fast small modes vanish); higher values indicate stronger contraction into fewer effective directions. The transport score summarizes how much the token distribution shifts between adjacent layers using a bounded overlap measure; lower values indicate shorter, smoother steps through representation space. Aligned checkpoints show a late-layer ramp-up in contraction and a smooth reduction in transport, consistent with tightened and stabilized policy mass, while unaligned models trace higher-curvature, more entropic, and geometrically incoherent depth paths. Overall, alignment is geometrically localized: the final layers encode the dominant preference-induced corrections. SPINAL turns this localization into a practical audit signal, quantifying where alignment concentrates, how strongly it manifests, and when it begins to destabilize during training.",

Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points. These advancements are achieved alongside a 0.34% higher watermark detection AUC and stronger robustness to attacks, all with a negligible increase in latency.

    "abstract": "LLM-as-judge systems promise scalable, consistent evaluation. We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values.",

To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey tracing this evolution. Specifically, we identify key dimensions that characterize this paradigm shift and establish a developmental taxonomy. We organize core methodologies and survey applications across general and professional domains.

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance by explicitly generating multi-step chains of thought, but this capability incurs substantial inference latency and computational cost. Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation.",

    "abstract": "As LLM-based agents are increasingly used in long-term interactions, cumulative memory is critical for enabling personalization and maintaining stylistic consistency. However, most existing systems adopt an ``all-or-nothing'' approach to memory usage: incorporating all relevant past information can lead to \\textit{Memory Anchoring}, where the agent is trapped by past interactions, while excluding memory entirely results in under-utilization and the loss of important interaction history. We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs. We then propose \\textbf{Stee}rable \\textbf{M}emory Agent, \\texttt{SteeM}, a framework that allows users to dynamically regulate memory reliance, ranging from a fresh-start mode that promotes innovation to a high-fidelity mode that closely follows interaction history. Experiments across different scenarios demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms conventional prompting and rigid memory masking strategies, yielding a more nuanced and effective control for personalized human-agent collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strengths across diverse domains. However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks.",

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users.",

Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, built for monolingual data, often fail to interpret the syntactic and semantic complexity of this code-mixed language, resulting in inaccurate sentiment analysis and misleading market insights. To address this gap, we propose a high-performance sentiment classification framework specifically designed for Hinglish tweets. Our approach fine-tunes mBERT (Multilingual BERT), leveraging its multilingual capabilities to better understand the linguistic diversity of Indian social media. A key component of our methodology is the use of subword tokenization, which enables the model to effectively manage spelling variations, slang, and out-of-vocabulary terms common in Romanized Hinglish. This research delivers a production-ready AI solution for brand sentiment tracking and establishes a strong benchmark for multilingual NLP in low-resource, code-mixed environments.",

This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signals through deep learning. A driving simulator created a controlled environment in which participants imagined controlling a vehicle during various driving scenarios, including left and right turns, as well as straight driving. A convolutional neural network (CNN) classified the detected EEG data with minimal pre-processing. Our model achieved an accuracy of 83.7% in distinguishing between the three steering intentions and demonstrated the ability of CNNs to process raw EEG data effectively. The classification accuracy was highest for right-turn segments, which suggests a potential spatial bias in brain activity.

These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark.

We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance. Overall, we show that private CoT reasoning can be achieved with minimal utility loss, providing practical guidance for building privacy-preserving reasoning systems.",

While existing work extensively addresses LLM steering for a single behavior, \\textit{compositional steering} -- i.e., steering LLMs simultaneously towards multiple behaviors -- remains an underexplored problem. In this work, we propose \\emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \\textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \\textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \\textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging). Moreover, we show that steering tokens complement natural language instructions, with their combination resulting in further gains.",

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

Here, we investigate this question across three pre-registered experiments in which participants (N = 2,724 Americans) discussed a conspiracy theory they were uncertain about with GPT-4o, and the model was instructed to either argue against (\"debunking\") or for (\"bunking\") that conspiracy. When using a \"jailbroken\" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to prevent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk.",

Given the stringent trade-off between training costs and model performance, the pivotal question is whether the optimal LR can be accurately extrapolated from low-cost experiments. In this paper, we formalize this investigation into two distinct research paradigms: Fitting and Transfer. Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_η) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $μ$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $μ$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings.

While researchers have tried ''compressing'' these documents into smaller summaries or mathematical embeddings, there is a catch: the more you compress the data, the more the LLM struggles to understand it. To address this challenge, we propose ArcAligner (Adaptive recursive context *Aligner*), a lightweight module integrated into the language model layers to help the model better utilize highly compressed context representations for downstream generation. It uses an adaptive ''gating'' system that only adds extra processing power when the information is complex, keeping the system fast. Across knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks, ArcAligner consistently beats compression baselines at comparable compression rates, especially on multi-hop and long-tail settings. The source code is publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Quantum generative modeling is a very active area of research in looking for practical advantage in data analysis. Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling.",

However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality.",

To address this limitation, we propose OptiSet, a set-centric framework that unifies set selection and set-level ranking for RAG. OptiSet adopts an \"Expand-then-Refine\" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence. Finally, we introduce a set-list wise training strategy that jointly optimizes set selection and set-level ranking, enabling the model to favor compact, high-gain evidence sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiSet improves performance on complex combinatorial problems and makes generation more efficient. The source code is publicly available.",

Testing the \"Hán Dān Xué Bù\" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a \"Functional Alignment Collapse\": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines (\"Negative Transfer\"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a \"Cargo Cult\" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation.",

In this design, the Planner coordinates modeling steps, the Actor executes them, and the Critic provides iterative feedback, while human users act as supervisors and advisors throughout the process. Through systematic comparison between single-prompt modeling and our reflective multi-agent approach, we demonstrate improvements in geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality, and task completion rates across diverse 3D modeling scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that critic-guided reflection, combined with human supervisory input, reduces modeling errors and increases complexity and quality of the result compared to direct single-prompt execution. This work establishes that structured agent self-reflection, when augmented by human oversight and advisory guidance, produces higher-quality 3D models while maintaining efficient workflow integration through real-time Blender synchronization.",

To study this phenomenon, we introduce a small, expert-curated dataset that explicitly evaluates LLMs on table question answering (TQA) tasks requiring an additional error-correction step prior to analysis. Our results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs ingest and interpret tabular information under distortion, with even SoTA models such as GPT-5.2 model exhibiting a drop of minimum 22% accuracy under distortion.

To answer this question, we propose AlgBench, an expert-curated benchmark that evaluates LRMs under an algorithm-centric paradigm. AlgBench consists of over 3,000 original problems spanning 27 algorithms, constructed by ACM algorithmic experts and organized under a comprehensive taxonomy, including Euclidean-structured, non-Euclidean-structured, non-optimized, local-optimized, global-optimized, and heuristic-optimized categories. Empirical evaluations on leading LRMs (e.g., Gemini-3-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale and GPT-o3) reveal substantial performance heterogeneity: while models perform well on non-optimized tasks (up to 92%), accuracy drops sharply to around 49% on globally optimized algorithms such as dynamic programming. Further analysis uncovers \\textbf{strategic over-shifts}, wherein models prematurely abandon correct algorithmic designs due to necessary low-entropy tokens.

For a single instance, many valid counterfactuals can exist, which leaves open the possibility for an explanation provider to cherry-pick explanations that better suit a narrative of their choice, highlighting favourable behaviour and withholding examples that reveal problematic behaviour. We formally define cherry-picking for counterfactual explanations in terms of an admissible explanation space, specified by the generation procedure, and a utility function. We then study to what extent an external auditor can detect such manipulation. Considering three levels of access to the explanation process: full procedural access, partial procedural access, and explanation-only access, we show that detection is extremely limited in practice. Even with full procedural access, cherry-picked explanations can remain difficult to distinguish from non cherry-picked explanations, because the multiplicity of valid counterfactuals and flexibility in the explanation specification provide sufficient degrees of freedom to mask deliberate selection. Empirically, we demonstrate that this variability often exceeds the effect of cherry-picking on standard counterfactual quality metrics such as proximity, plausibility, and sparsity, making cherry-picked explanations statistically indistinguishable from baseline explanations. We argue that safeguards should therefore prioritise reproducibility, standardisation, and procedural constraints over post-hoc detection, and we provide recommendations for algorithm developers, explanation providers, and auditors.",

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality scores of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.",

However, this capability often leads to ``overthinking'', where models generate redundant reasoning paths that inflate computational costs without improving accuracy. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs.",

The formulation leads to interpretable and reusable preference descriptions, while naturally supporting continual evolution as new interactions are observed. To learn such representations, we introduce a two-stage training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning on high-quality synthesized data with reinforcement learning to optimize long-term utility and cross-task transferability. Based on this framework, we develop AlignXplore+, a universal preference reasoning model that generates textual preference summaries.

Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\\% in performance while achieving a 58\\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards.",

    "abstract": "Automatic metrics are now central to evaluating text-to-image models, often substituting for human judgment in benchmarking and large-scale filtering. However, it remains unclear whether these metrics truly prioritize semantic correctness or instead favor visually and socially prototypical images learned from biased data distributions. We identify and study prototypicality bias as a systematic failure mode in multimodal evaluation. We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark ProtoBias (Prototypical Bias), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts. This setup enables a directional evaluation of whether metrics follow textual semantics or default to prototypes. Our results show that widely used metrics, including CLIPScore, PickScore, and VQA-based scores, frequently misrank these pairs, while even LLM-as-Judge systems exhibit uneven robustness in socially grounded cases. Human evaluations consistently favour semantic correctness with larger decision margins. Motivated by these findings, we propose ProtoScore, a robust 7B-parameter metric that substantially reduces failure rates and suppresses misranking, while running at orders of magnitude faster than the inference time of GPT-5, approaching the robustness of much larger closed-source judges.",

We introduce T-Retriever, a novel framework that reformulates attributed graph retrieval as tree-based retrieval using a semantic and structure-guided encoding tree. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Compression Encoding, which replaces artificial compression quotas with a global optimization strategy that preserves the graph's natural hierarchical organization, and (2) Semantic-Structural Entropy ($S^2$-Entropy), which jointly optimizes for both structural cohesion and semantic consistency when creating hierarchical partitions. Experiments across diverse graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that T-Retriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods, providing more coherent and contextually relevant responses to complex queries.",

    "abstract": "The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, driven by increased digitalization and new cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity programs often fail to equip graduates with skills demanded by the workforce, particularly concerning recent developments in cybersecurity, as curriculum design is costly and labor-intensive. To address this misalignment, we present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for automated design and analysis of cybersecurity curricula, called CurricuLLM. Our approach provides three key contributions: (1) automation of personalized curriculum design, (2) a data-driven pipeline aligned with industry demands, and (3) a comprehensive methodology for leveraging fine-tuned LLMs in curriculum development.\n  CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity. We systematically evaluated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on foundational cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies.\n  We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis. Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs. This lays the foundation for personalized, workforce-aligned cybersecurity curricula that prepare students for the evolving demands in cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding partners, yet their role in accelerating scientific discovery remains underexplored. This paper presents a case study of using ChatGPT for rapid prototyping in ESA's ELOPE (Event-based Lunar OPtical flow Egomotion estimation) competition. The competition required participants to process event camera data to estimate lunar lander trajectories. Despite joining late, we achieved second place with a score of 0.01282, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in competitive scientific settings. ChatGPT contributed not only executable code but also algorithmic reasoning, data handling routines, and methodological suggestions, such as using fixed number of events instead of fixed time spans for windowing. At the same time, we observed limitations: the model often introduced unnecessary structural changes, gets confused by intermediate discussions about alternative ideas, occasionally produced critical errors and forgets important aspects in longer scientific discussions. By analyzing these strengths and shortcomings, we show how conversational AI can both accelerate development and support conceptual insight in scientific research. We argue that structured integration of LLMs into the scientific workflow can enhance rapid prototyping by proposing best practices for AI-assisted scientific work.",

Yet students, especially those with lower self-regulated learning (SRL) competence, often struggle to engage with and interpret analytics feedback. Conversational generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants have shown potential to scaffold this process through real-time, personalised, dialogue-based support. Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning. Findings revealed distinct query patterns. While low SRL students sought clarification and reassurance, high SRL students queried technical aspects and requested personalised strategies. The assistant provided clear and reliable explanations but limited in personalisation, handling emotionally charged queries, and integrating multiple data points for tailored responses. Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers. At the same time, students' reflections underscored the importance of trust, need for greater adaptivity, context-awareness, and technical refinement in future systems.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of network technologies, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have emerged to deliver increasingly precise and tailored personalized learning services. Cognitive diagnosis (CD) has emerged as a core research task in ITS, aiming to infer learners' mastery of specific knowledge concepts by modeling the mapping between learning behavior data and knowledge states. However, existing research prioritizes model performance enhancement while neglecting the pervasive noise contamination in observed response data, significantly hindering practical deployment. Furthermore, current cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) rely heavily on researchers' domain expertise for structural design, which fails to exhaustively explore architectural possibilities, thus leaving model architectures' full potential untapped. To address this issue, we propose OSCD, an evolutionary multi-objective One-Shot neural architecture search method for Cognitive Diagnosis, designed to efficiently and robustly improve the model's capability in assessing learner proficiency. Specifically, OSCD operates through two distinct stages: training and searching. During the training stage, we construct a search space encompassing diverse architectural combinations and train a weight-sharing supernet represented via the complete binary tree topology, enabling comprehensive exploration of potential architectures beyond manual design priors. In the searching stage, we formulate the optimal architecture search under heterogeneous noise scenarios as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), and develop an optimization framework integrating a Pareto-optimal solution search strategy with cross-scenario performance evaluation for resolution. Extensive experiments on real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the optimal architectures discovered by our OSCD model for CD tasks.",

Unlike verbatim leakage, these paraphrased or structurally transformed variants evade existing detectors based on sampling consistency or perplexity, thereby inflating benchmark scores via memorization rather than genuine reasoning. We formalize this problem and introduce \\textbf{DVD} (\\textbf{D}etection via \\textbf{V}ariance of generation \\textbf{D}istribution), a single-sample detector that models the local output distribution induced by temperature sampling. Our key insight is that contaminated items trigger alternation between a \\emph{memory-adherence} state and a \\emph{perturbation-drift} state, yielding abnormally high variance in the synthetic difficulty of low-probability tokens; uncontaminated items remain in drift with comparatively smooth variance. We construct the first benchmark for variant contamination across two domains Omni-MATH and SuperGPQA by generating and filtering semantically equivalent variants, and simulate contamination via fine-tuning models of different scales and architectures (Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1). Across datasets and models, \\textbf{DVD} consistently outperforms perplexity-based, Min-$k$\\%++, edit-distance (CDD), and embedding-similarity baselines, while exhibiting strong robustness to hyperparameters.

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based search agents have proven promising for addressing knowledge-intensive problems by incorporating information retrieval capabilities. Existing works largely focus on optimizing the reasoning paradigms of search agents, yet the quality of intermediate search queries during reasoning remains overlooked. As a result, the generated queries often remain inaccurate, leading to unexpected retrieval results and ultimately limiting search agents' overall effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce SmartSearch, a framework built upon two key mechanisms: (1) Process rewards, which provide fine-grained supervision for the quality of each intermediate search query through Dual-Level Credit Assessment. (2) Query refinement, which promotes the optimization of query generation by selectively refining low-quality search queries and regenerating subsequent search rounds based on these refinements. To enable the search agent to progressively internalize the ability to improve query quality under the guidance of process rewards, we design a three-stage curriculum learning framework. This framework guides the agent through a progression from imitation, to alignment, and ultimately to generalization. Experimental results show that SmartSearch consistently surpasses existing baselines, and additional quantitative analyses further confirm its significant gains in both search efficiency and query quality.

CTPNs provide a formal modeling structure and dynamic action masking, significantly reducing the action search space, while MBRL ensures adaptability to changing environments through the learned policy. Leveraging the advantages of MBRL, we incorporate a lookahead strategy for optimal positioning of AGVs, improving operational efficiency. Our approach was evaluated on small-sized public benchmarks and a newly developed large-scale benchmark inspired by the Taillard benchmark. The results show that our approach matches traditional methods on smaller instances and outperforms them on larger ones in terms of makespan while achieving a tenfold reduction in computation time.

    "abstract": "Executing a multi-agent plan can be challenging when an agent is delayed, because this typically creates conflicts with other agents. So, we need to quickly find a new safe plan. Replanning only the delayed agent often does not result in an efficient plan, and sometimes cannot even yield a feasible plan. On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario. We demonstrate our method in a real-world case study of replanning trains in the densely-used Dutch railway network. Our experiments show that FlexSIPP provides effective solutions, relevant to real-world adjustments, and within a reasonable timeframe.",

    "abstract": "Scientific inquiry requires systems-level reasoning that integrates heterogeneous experimental data, cross-domain knowledge, and mechanistic evidence into coherent explanations. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a \"teacherless\" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning aims to enable models to acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned information. Prompt-based methods have shown remarkable performance in this domain; however, they typically rely on key-value pairing, which can introduce inter-task interference and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach employing task-specific Prompt-Prototype (ProP), thereby eliminating the need for key-value pairs. In our method, task-specific prompts facilitate more effective feature learning for the current task, while corresponding prototypes capture the representative features of the input. During inference, predictions are generated by binding each task-specific prompt with its associated prototype. Additionally, we introduce regularization constraints during prompt initialization to penalize excessively large values, thereby enhancing stability. Experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In contrast to mainstream prompt-based approaches, our framework removes the dependency on key-value pairs, offering a fresh perspective for future continual learning research.",

Existing frameworks typically deploy large language models (LLMs) uniformly across all agent roles, failing to account for the varying cognitive demands of different reasoning stages. We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models. Experimental results show that OI-MAS consistently outperforms baseline multi-agent systems, improving accuracy by up to 12.88\\% while reducing cost by up to 79.78\\%.",

Existing studies mostly address relatively benign scenarios, namely benchmark datasets with (a) high-dimensional but sparse node features and (b) incomplete data generated under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) mechanisms. For (a), we theoretically prove that high sparsity substantially limits the information loss caused by missingness, making all models appear robust and preventing a meaningful comparison of their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce one synthetic and three real-world datasets with dense, semantically meaningful features. For (b), we move beyond MCAR and design evaluation protocols with more realistic missingness mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a theoretical background to state explicit assumptions on the missingness process and analyze their implications for different methods. Building on this analysis, we propose GNNmim, a simple yet effective baseline for node classification with incomplete feature data. Experiments show that GNNmim is competitive with respect to specialized architectures across diverse datasets and missingness regimes.",

This premature discretization underlies well-known failure modes, including degenerate repetition loops in greedy decoding and a heavy reliance on heuristic sampling strategies.\n  We introduce \\textbf{Token Maturation}, a continuous autoregressive framework in which tokens evolve as vector-valued trajectories prior to discretization. Rather than sampling from a categorical distribution at each step, the model resolves uncertainty through a deterministic dynamical process in embedding space, deferring discrete commitment until the representation has geometrically stabilized.\n  We show that this formulation mitigates degeneration \\emph{intrinsically}: Token Maturation generates coherent and diverse text under fully deterministic decoding (argmax), without repetition penalties, temperature scaling, or stochastic sampling. Moreover, we identify a novel convergence behavior in which token representations stabilize spatially while predictive entropy remains high, challenging the common assumption that commitment requires probability concentration. We propose continuous token dynamics with delayed commitment as an alternative formulation of autoregressive generation that exposes structural regularities obscured by immediate discretization.",

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, is widely adopted to adapt pretrained MoE LLMs to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches assign identical LoRA ranks to all experts, overlooking the intrinsic functional specialization within MoE LLMs. This uniform allocation leads to resource mismatch, task-relevant experts are under-provisioned while less relevant ones receive redundant parameters. We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization.",

We present AECV-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal and vision-language models on realistic AEC artefacts via two complementary use cases: (i) object counting on 120 high-quality floor plans (doors, windows, bedrooms, toilets), and (ii) drawing-grounded document QA spanning 192 question-answer pairs that test text extraction (OCR), instance counting, spatial reasoning, and comparative reasoning over common drawing regions. Object-counting performance is reported using per-field exact-match accuracy and MAPE results, while document-QA performance is reported using overall accuracy and per-category breakdowns with an LLM-as-a-judge scoring pipeline and targeted human adjudication for edge cases. Evaluating a broad set of state-of-the-art models under a unified protocol, we observe a stable capability gradient; OCR and text-centric document QA are strongest (up to 0.95 accuracy), spatial reasoning is moderate, and symbol-centric drawing understanding - especially reliable counting of doors and windows - remains unsolved (often 0.40-0.55 accuracy) with substantial proportional errors. These results suggest that current systems function well as document assistants but lack robust drawing literacy, motivating domain-specific representations and tool-augmented, human-in-the-loop workflows for an efficient AEC automation.",

In practice, RL progress often slows when task difficulty becomes poorly aligned with model capability, or when training is dominated by a narrow set of recurring problem patterns. To jointly address these issues, we propose SCALER (Synthetic sCalable Adaptive Learning Environment for Reasoning), a framework that sustains effective learning signals through adaptive environment design. SCALER introduces a scalable synthesis pipeline that converts real-world programming problems into verifiable reasoning environments with controllable difficulty and unbounded instance generation, enabling RL training beyond finite datasets while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Building on this, SCALER further employs an adaptive multi-environment RL strategy that dynamically adjusts instance difficulty and curates the active set of environments to track the model's capability frontier and maintain distributional diversity. This co-adaptation prevents reward sparsity, mitigates overfitting to narrow task patterns, and supports sustained improvement throughout training. Extensive experiments show that SCALER consistently outperforms dataset-based RL baselines across diverse reasoning benchmarks and exhibits more stable, long-horizon training dynamics.",

This paper introduces a novel approach to parallelizing node-level explainability in GNNs through graph partitioning. By decomposing the graph into disjoint subgraphs, we enable parallel computation of explainability for node neighbors, significantly improving the scalability and efficiency without affecting the correctness of the results, provided sufficient memory is available. For scenarios where memory is limited, we further propose a dropout-based reconstruction mechanism that offers a controllable trade-off between memory usage and explanation fidelity.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have attracted much attention due to their exceptional performance. However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods. Additionally, the probability of reward hacking problem in TNT's responses, which are classified as not using thinking, remains below 10% across all tested datasets.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "As LLM agents transition from digital assistants to physical controllers in autonomous systems and robotics, they face an escalating threat from indirect prompt injection. By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Applying French and Raven's power-based theory, we classify authoritative roles into legitimate, referent, and expert types and analyze their influence across 12-turn conversations. Experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 reveal that Expert and Referent power roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate power roles. Crucially, authority bias emerges not through active conformity by general agents, but through authoritative roles consistently maintaining their positions while general agents demonstrate flexibility. Furthermore, authority influence requires clear position statements, as neutral responses fail to generate bias. These findings provide key insights for designing multi-agent frameworks with asymmetric interaction patterns.",

To address the inefficiency of manual convexification and the over-reliance on expert knowledge, we propose NC2C, an LLM-based end-to-end automated framework designed to transform generic non-convex optimization problems into solvable convex forms using large language models. NC2C leverages LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities to autonomously detect non-convex components, select optimal convexification strategies, and generate rigorous convex equivalents. The framework integrates symbolic reasoning, adaptive transformation techniques, and iterative validation, equipped with error correction loops and feasibility domain correction mechanisms to ensure the robustness and validity of transformed problems. Experimental results on a diverse dataset of 100 generic non-convex problems demonstrate that NC2C achieves an 89.3\\% execution rate and a 76\\% success rate in producing feasible, high-quality convex transformations. This outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin, highlighting NC2C's ability to leverage LLMs for automated non-convex to convex transformation, reduce expert dependency, and enable efficient deployment of convex solvers for previously intractable optimization tasks.",

We introduce AgentOCR, a framework that exploits the superior information density of visual tokens by representing the accumulated observation-action history as a compact rendered image. To make multi-turn rollouts scalable, AgentOCR proposes segment optical caching. By decomposing history into hashable segments and maintaining a visual cache, this mechanism eliminates redundant re-rendering. Beyond fixed rendering, AgentOCR introduces agentic self-compression, where the agent actively emits a compression rate and is trained with compression-aware reward to adaptively balance task success and token efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks, ALFWorld and search-based QA. Remarkably, results demonstrate that AgentOCR preserves over 95\\% of text-based agent performance while substantially reducing token consumption (>50\\%), yielding consistent token and memory efficiency. Our further analysis validates a 20x rendering speedup from segment optical caching and the effective strategic balancing of self-compression.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed tissue information, but its clinical application is limited by long acquisition time, high cost, and restricted resolution. Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability. These results suggest an effective extension of Pix2Pix for medical image translation.",

Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in single-image grounding and general multi-image understanding. Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW. Furthermore, our model retains strong capabilities in general multi-image understanding.",

Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.",

Conventional prioritization frameworks such as CVSS offer static severity metrics that fail to account for exploit probability, compliance urgency, and operational impact, resulting in inefficient and delayed remediation. This paper introduces RiskBridge, an explainable and compliance-aware vulnerability management framework that integrates multi-source intelligence from CVSS v4, EPSS, and CISA KEV to produce dynamic, business -- aligned patch priorities. RiskBridge employs a probabilistic Zero-Day Exposure Simulation (ZDES) model to forecast near-term exploit likelihood, a Policy-as-Code Engine to translate regulatory mandates (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST SP 800-53) into automated SLA logic, and an ROI-driven Optimizer to maximize cumulative risk reduction per remediation effort. Experimental evaluations using live CVE datasets demonstrate an 88% reduction in residual risk, an 18-day improvement in SLA compliance, and a 35% increase in remediation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art commercial baselines. These findings validate RiskBridge as a practical and auditable decision-intelligence system that unifies probabilistic modeling, compliance reasoning, and optimization analytics. The framework represents a step toward automated, explainable, and business-centric vulnerability management in modern enterprise environments",

Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.",

To bridge this gap, we present Orion-RAG. Our core insight is simple yet effective: we do not need heavy algorithms to organize this data. Instead, we use a low-complexity strategy to extract lightweight paths that naturally link related concepts. We demonstrate that this streamlined approach suffices to transform fragmented documents into semi-structured data, enabling the system to link information across different files effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orion-RAG consistently outperforms mainstream frameworks across diverse domains, supporting real-time updates and explicit Human-in-the-Loop verification with high cost-efficiency.

    "abstract": "Manual observation and monitoring of individual cows for disease detection present significant challenges in large-scale farming operations, as the process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to reduced accuracy. The reliance on human observation often leads to delays in identifying symptoms, as the sheer number of animals can hinder timely attention to each cow. Consequently, the accuracy and precision of disease detection are significantly compromised, potentially affecting animal health and overall farm productivity. Furthermore, organizing and managing human resources for the manual observation and monitoring of cow health is a complex and economically demanding task. It necessitates the involvement of skilled personnel, thereby contributing to elevated farm maintenance costs and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, the development of an automated, low-cost, and reliable smart system is essential to address these challenges effectively. Although several studies have been conducted in this domain, very few have simultaneously considered the detection of multiple common diseases with high prediction accuracy. However, advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Cyber-Physical Systems have enabled the automation of cow health monitoring with enhanced accuracy and reduced operational costs. This study proposes an IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical System framework designed to monitor the daily activities and health status of cow. A novel ML algorithm is proposed for the diagnosis of common cow diseases using collected physiological and behavioral data. The algorithm is designed to predict multiple diseases by analyzing a comprehensive set of recorded physiological and behavioral features, enabling accurate and efficient health assessment.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Multi-agent AI systems have proven effective for complex reasoning. These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.",

This task is further hampered by severe data scarcity and the subjective nature of clinical annotations. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a viable path to leverage unlabeled data, existing audio methods often fail to address the core challenge that pathological traits are not uniformly expressed in a patient's speech. We propose a novel, audio-only SSL framework that explicitly models this hierarchy by jointly learning from frame-level, segment-level, and session-level representations within unsegmented clinical dialogues. Our end-to-end approach dynamically aggregates these multi-granularity features and generates high-quality pseudo-labels to efficiently utilize unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show the framework is model-agnostic, robust across languages and conditions, and highly data-efficient-achieving, for instance, 90\\% of fully-supervised performance using only 11 labeled samples.

A key characteristic of real-world data streams is their dynamic nature, where the underlying patterns evolve over time. To address this, we present TimeCast, a dynamic prediction framework designed to adapt to these changes and provide accurate, real-time predictions of future event time. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Dynamic: it identifies the distinct time-evolving patterns (i.e., stages) and learns individual models for each, enabling us to make adaptive predictions based on pattern shifts. (b) Practical: it finds meaningful stages that capture time-varying interdependencies between multiple sensors and improve prediction performance; (c) Scalable: our algorithm scales linearly with the input size and enables online model updates on data streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that TimeCast provides higher prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while finding dynamic changes in data streams with a great reduction in computational time.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in specialized domains such as finance and healthcare, where they introduce unique safety risks. Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.",

However, recent studies show that FL models may still leak sensitive information through their outputs, motivating the need for rigorous privacy evaluation. In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance. These findings confirm MIA as a practical metric and highlight the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising application domain for near-term quantum hardware, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical models that leverage both classical and quantum processing. Although numerous hybrid architectures have been proposed and demonstrated successfully on benchmark tasks, a significant open question remains regarding the specific contribution of quantum components to the overall performance of these models. In this work, we aim to shed light on the impact of quantum processing within hybrid quantum-classical neural network architectures through a rigorous statistical study. We systematically assess common hybrid models on medical signal data as well as planar and volumetric images, examining the influence attributable to classical and quantum aspects such as encoding schemes, entanglement, and circuit size. We find that in best-case scenarios, hybrid models show performance comparable to their classical counterparts, however, in most cases, performance metrics deteriorate under the influence of quantum components. Our multi-modal analysis provides realistic insights into the contributions of quantum components and advocates for cautious claims and design choices for hybrid models in near-term applications.",

Evaluated across six reasoning benchmarks on Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B base models, Miner achieves state-of-the-art performance among the other four algorithms, yielding up to \\textbf{4.58} absolute gains in Pass@1 and \\textbf{6.66} gains in Pass@K compared to GRPO. Comparison with other methods targeted at exploration enhancement further discloses the superiority of the two newly proposed innovations.

We develop a formal information-theoretic framework for quantifying how much predictive structure fine-tuning extracts from the train dataset and writes into a model's parameters. Our central quantity, Excess Description Length (EDL), is defined via prequential coding and measures the gap between the bits required to encode training labels sequentially using an evolving model (trained online) and the residual encoding cost under the final trained model. We establish that EDL is non-negative in expectation, converges to surplus description length in the infinite-data limit, and provides bounds on expected generalization gain. Through a series of toy models, we clarify common confusions about information in learning: why random labels yield EDL near zero, how a single example can eliminate many bits of uncertainty about the underlying rule(s) that describe the data distribution, why structure learned on rare inputs contributes proportionally little to expected generalization, and how format learning creates early transients distinct from capability acquisition. This framework provides rigorous foundations for the empirical observation that capability elicitation and teaching exhibit qualitatively distinct scaling signatures.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent agents that reason, plan, and interact with their environments. To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models.",

This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks.",

We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively. Moreover, a 2B-parameter model trained with our method surpasses the much larger GPT-4o by 3.28% on the exam metric.",

While hallucination detection has recently emerged as a priority in English-centric benchmarks, low-to-medium resource languages such as Vietnamese remain inadequately covered by standardized evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations. The dataset incorporates three prompt types -- factual, noisy, and adversarial -- to stress-test model robustness. A total of 111 teams participated, with the best-performing system achieving a macro-F1 score of 84.80\\%, compared to a baseline encoder-only score of 32.83\\%, demonstrating that instruction-tuned LLMs with structured prompting and ensemble strategies substantially outperform generic architectures. However, the gap to perfect performance indicates that hallucination detection remains a challenging problem, particularly for intrinsic (contradiction-based) hallucinations. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark and explores a diverse range of detection methodologies, providing a foundation for future research into the trustworthiness and reliability of Vietnamese language AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Root cause analysis in modern cloud infrastructure demands sophisticated understanding of heterogeneous data sources, particularly time-series performance metrics that involve core failure signatures. While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in textual reasoning, their discrete token-based architecture creates fundamental incompatibilities with continuous numerical sequences exhibiting temporal dependencies. Current methodologies inadequately address this modality mismatch, constraining the potential of language model-driven automation in incident management workflows. This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution. Comprehensive evaluation across six cloud system benchmarks demonstrates that our framework achieves leading performance, reaching 48.75% diagnostic accuracy with notable improvements on scenarios involving compound failure modes. The results validate embedding-space alignment as an effective strategy for enabling language models to reason over multimodal telemetry data in production incident response contexts.",

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{M-ASK} (Multi-Agent Search and Knowledge), a framework that explicitly decouples agentic search into two complementary roles: Search Behavior Agents, which plan and execute search actions, and Knowledge Management Agents, which aggregate, filter, and maintain a compact internal context. This decomposition allows each agent to focus on a well-defined subtask and reduces interference between search and context construction. Furthermore, to enable stable coordination, M-ASK employs turn-level rewards to provide granular supervision for both search decisions and knowledge updates. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that M-ASK outperforms strong baselines, achieving not only superior answer accuracy but also significantly more stable training dynamics.\\footnote{The source code for M-ASK is available at https://github.com/chenyiqun/M-ASK.}",

To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first introduce a Personalized Recall and Spatial Optimization (PReSO) workflow to construct spatially-aware candidate POIs' set. Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space. To further refine the plan, we integrate a sigmoid-based gating mechanism into the reinforcement learning stage, which dynamically prioritizes soft-constraint satisfaction only after hard constraints are met.

First, a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model is used to perform entity recognition and relationship extraction on multi-source heterogeneous texts, and GPT-4 is used to generate semantically enhanced vector representations; secondly, a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) architecture is designed to fuse the semantic vectors output by LLM with business metadata to construct a dynamic and scalable enterprise knowledge graph; then reinforcement learning is introduced to optimize decision path generation, and the reward function is used to drive the mechanism iteration. In the case of the manufacturing industry, this mechanism reduced the response time for equipment failure scenarios from 7.8 hours to 3.7 hours, the F1 value reached 94.3%, and the compensation for decision errors in the annual digital transformation cost decreased by 45.3%. This method significantly enhances the intelligence level and execution efficiency of the digital transformation driving mechanism by integrating large model semantic understanding with structured knowledge.",

Using a reproducible evaluation pipeline, we compare model-free baselines, model-based planning with learned world models, and task-inference (meta-RL) methods. A consistent pattern emerges: methods that are strong in-distribution (ID) can collapse under heldout-rule OOD, and high-variance OOD evaluation can make rankings unstable unless experiments are sufficiently replicated.We provide (i) standardized OOD protocols, (ii) statistical reporting requirements (seeds, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests), and (iii) information-theoretic identities connecting entropy reduction to conditional mutual information and expected posterior KL divergence, clarifying what \"uncertainty reduction\" objectives can and cannot guarantee under rule shifts.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-based MAS), where multiple LLM agents collaborate to solve complex tasks, have shown impressive performance in many areas. However, MAS are typically distributed across different devices or environments, making them vulnerable to perturbations such as agent failures. While existing works have studied the adversarial attacks and corresponding defense strategies, they mainly focus on reactively detecting and mitigating attacks after they occur rather than proactively designing inherently resilient systems. In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents. Extensive experiments across a range of tasks show that our approach substantially improves MAS resilience under various constraints. Moreover, our framework demonstrates strong generalization ability to new tasks and models, highlighting its potential for building resilient MASs.",

However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \\textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-expert-level capabilities, driving significant interest in their potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). In particular, there is growing momentum in adapting LLMs to various modalities, including vision, video, and speech, through the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, existing speech-language model (SLM) research has largely overlooked cost-effective adaptation strategies for leveraging LLMs in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose FastSLM, a lightweight yet efficient SLM designed for effective understanding and reasoning over long-form speech. To address the challenge of aligning high-frame-rate speech features with LLMs, we introduce the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which compresses frame-level speech features while capturing both local and global context. Furthermore, we present a novel three-stage training strategy that enhances generalization across a wide range of speech-related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts, while representing speech with only 1.67 tokens per second.

Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement. Completeness is preserved by fallback to traditional solvers augmented with learned constraints. Experimental evaluation on SMT-COMP benchmarks demonstrates that AquaForte solves numerous instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas. Our work shows that LLMs can provide valuable mathematical intuition for symbolic reasoning, establishing a new paradigm for SMT constraint solving.",

This paper focuses on estimating causal effects in Gaussian Linear Structural Causal Models (GL-SCMs), which are widely used due to their analytical tractability. However, parameter estimation in GL-SCMs is often infeasible with finite data, primarily due to overparameterization. To address this, we introduce the class of Centralized Gaussian Linear SCMs (CGL-SCMs), a simplified yet expressive subclass where exogenous variables follow standardized distributions. We show that CGL-SCMs are equally expressive in terms of causal effect identifiability from observational distributions and present a novel EM-based estimation algorithm that can learn CGL-SCM parameters and estimate identifiable causal effects from finite observational samples. Our theoretical analysis is validated through experiments on synthetic data and benchmark causal graphs, demonstrating that the learned models accurately recover causal distributions.",

The study then explores DRL approaches, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which demonstrate improved adaptability and performance in two-dimensional simulations. Enhancements such as Double Q-Networks and Dueling Networks are evaluated to further improve decision-making. Building on these results, the focus shifts to continuous action space models, specifically Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), which are tested in increasingly complex environments. Experiments conducted in a three-dimensional environment using ROS and Gazebo demonstrate the effectiveness of continuous DRL algorithms in navigating dynamic agricultural scenarios.

To address these issues, we propose InstruCoT, a model enhancement method for PI defense that synthesizes diverse training data and employs instruction-level chain-of-thought fine-tuning, enabling LLMs to effectively identify and reject malicious instructions regardless of their source or position in the context. We evaluate InstruCoT across three critical dimensions: Behavior Deviation, Privacy Leakage, and Harmful Output.

We propose CRANE, a relevance-based analysis framework that redefines language specificity in terms of functional necessity, identifying language-specific neurons through targeted neuron-level interventions. CRANE characterizes neuron specialization by their contribution to language-conditioned predictions rather than activation magnitude. Our implementation will be made publicly available. Neuron-level interventions reveal a consistent asymmetric pattern: masking neurons relevant to a target language selectively degrades performance on that language while preserving performance on other languages to a substantial extent, indicating language-selective but non-exclusive neuron specializations. Experiments on English, Chinese, and Vietnamese across multiple benchmarks, together with a dedicated relevance-based metric and base-to-chat model transfer analysis, show that CRANE isolates language-specific components more precisely than activation-based methods.",

To address this, we propose LAMB, an LLM-based audio captioning framework that bridges the modality gap between audio embeddings and the LLM text embedding space. LAMB incorporates a Cross-Modal Aligner that minimizes Cauchy-Schwarz divergence while maximizing mutual information, yielding tighter alignment between audio and text at both global and token levels.

The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.",

This \"dark data\" problem is exacerbated by the operational cost of model updates: jointly fine-tuning query and document encoders requires re-indexing the entire corpus, which is prohibitive in multi-tenant environments with thousands of isolated indices. To address these dual challenges, we introduce \\textbf{DevRev Search}, a passage retrieval benchmark for technical customer support constructed through a fully automatic pipeline. We employ a \\textbf{fusion-based candidate generation} strategy, pooling results from diverse sparse and dense retrievers, and utilize an LLM-as-a-Judge to perform rigorous \\textbf{consistency filtering} and relevance assignment. We further propose a practical \\textbf{Index-Preserving Adaptation} strategy: by fine-tuning only the query encoder via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we achieve competitive performance improvements while keeping the document index frozen. Our experiments on DevRev Search and SciFact demonstrate that targeting specific transformer layers in the query encoder yields optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs, offering a scalable path for personalized enterprise search.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate factually incorrect or unsupported content, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Prior work has explored decoding strategies, retrieval augmentation, and supervised fine-tuning for hallucination detection, while recent studies show that in-context learning (ICL) can substantially influence factual reliability. However, existing ICL demonstration selection methods often rely on surface-level similarity heuristics and exhibit limited robustness across tasks and models.\n  We propose MB-ICL, a manifold-based demonstration sampling framework for selecting in-context demonstrations that leverages latent representations extracted from frozen LLMs. By jointly modeling local manifold structure and class-aware prototype geometry, MB-ICL selects demonstrations based on their proximity to learned prototypes rather than lexical or embedding similarity alone.\n  Across factual verification (FEVER) and hallucination detection (HaluEval) benchmarks, MB-ICL outperforms standard ICL selection baselines in the majority of evaluated settings, with particularly strong gains on dialogue and summarization tasks. The method remains robust under temperature perturbations and model variation, indicating improved stability compared to heuristic retrieval strategies. While lexical retrieval can remain competitive in certain question-answering regimes, our results demonstrate that manifold-based prototype selection provides a reliable and training light approach for hallucination detection without modifying LLM parameters, offering a principled direction for improved ICL demonstration selection.",

Recent advances in speech language models (SpeechLMs) have enabled more natural speech-based interaction, yet the scarcity of medical speech data and the inefficiency of directly fine-tuning on speech data jointly hinder the adoption of SpeechLMs in medical consultation. In this paper, we propose SpeechMedAssist, a SpeechLM natively capable of conducting speech-based multi-turn interactions with patients. By exploiting the architectural properties of SpeechLMs, we decouple the conventional one-stage training into a two-stage paradigm consisting of (1) Knowledge & Capability Injection via Text and (2) Modality Re-alignment with Limited Speech Data, thereby reducing the requirement for medical speech data to only 10k synthesized samples. To evaluate SpeechLMs for medical consultation scenarios, we design a benchmark comprising both single-turn question answering and multi-turn simulated interactions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all baselines in both effectiveness and robustness in most evaluation settings.",

The Rumor Detection Agent combines (i) a synthetic data-augmented, fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, (ii) precision keyword filtering, and (iii) a two-pass LLM verification pipeline using GPT-4o mini. The findings reveal that sharing probability rises steadily with each additional exposure, providing large-scale empirical evidence for dose-response belief reinforcement in ideologically homogeneous networks. Simulation results further demonstrate rapid contagion effects: nearly one quarter of users become \"infected\" within just four propagation iterations. Taken together, these results illustrate how LLMs can transform psychological science by enabling the rigorous measurement of belief dynamics and misinformation spread in massive, real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large language model (LLM) agents has largely focused on embedding self-improvement mechanisms inside the agent or searching over many concurrent variants. While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development.",

    "abstract": "Modeling human decision-making is central to applications such as recommendation, preference learning, and human-AI alignment. While many classic models assume context-independent choice behavior, a large body of behavioral research shows that preferences are often influenced by the composition of the choice set itself -- a phenomenon known as the context effect or Halo effect. These effects can manifest as pairwise (first-order) or even higher-order interactions among the available alternatives. Recent models that attempt to capture such effects either focus on the featureless setting or, in the feature-based setting, rely on restrictive interaction structures or entangle interactions across all orders, which limits interpretability. In this work, we propose DeepHalo, a neural modeling framework that incorporates features while enabling explicit control over interaction order and principled interpretation of context effects. Our model enables systematic identification of interaction effects by order and serves as a universal approximator of context-dependent choice functions when specialized to a featureless setting. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate strong predictive performance while providing greater transparency into the drivers of choice.",

Our results show that machine learning models provide good accuracy rates, but their confidence levels vary significantly. Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence.

To address these issues, we propose a high uncertainty region-guided multi-architecture collaborative learning (HUR-MACL) model for multi-organ segmentation in the head and neck. This model adaptively identifies high uncertainty regions using a convolutional neural network, and for these regions, Vision Mamba as well as Deformable CNN are utilized to jointly improve their segmentation accuracy. Additionally, a heterogeneous feature distillation loss was proposed to promote collaborative learning between the two architectures in high uncertainty regions to further enhance performance.

Using the GPU acceleration, this implementation achieves about fivefold speed compared to our previous CPU workflow, while yielding comparable outcomes. In addition, we introduce the optimization strategy that alternatively performs optimization on the direct and latent crystal representations. This dual-level relaxation approach can effectively escape local minima defined by different objective gradients, thus increasing the success rate of generating complex structures satisfying the target local environments. This framework can be extended to systems consisting of multi-components and multi-environments, providing a scalable route to generate material structures with the target local environment.",

First, we develop exchange classifiers that evaluate model responses in their full conversational context, which addresses vulnerabilities in last-generation systems that examine outputs in isolation. Second, we implement a two-stage classifier cascade where lightweight classifiers screen all traffic and escalate only suspicious exchanges to more expensive classifiers. Third, we train efficient linear probe classifiers and ensemble them with external classifiers to simultaneously improve robustness and reduce computational costs. Together, these techniques yield a production-grade system achieving a 40x computational cost reduction compared to our baseline exchange classifier, while maintaining a 0.05% refusal rate on production traffic. Through extensive red-teaming comprising over 1,700 hours, we demonstrate strong protection against universal jailbreaks -- no attack on this system successfully elicited responses to all eight target queries comparable in detail to an undefended model.

However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the \"hopping-too-late\" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of \"hopping-too-late\" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve accuracy on 2-hop questions by at least 15.5 percentage points, representing a 96% increase over the previous single-edit strategy, while trading off some specificity and language naturalness.",

The framework integrates multiple knowledge transfer techniques--including traditional knowledge distillation, contrastive learning, and NKD--within a unified architecture that maintains privacy while reducing communication costs. Through experiments on healthcare datasets (SLEEP, UCI-HAR, and PAMAP2), FedKDX demonstrates improved accuracy (up to 2.53% over state-of-the-art methods), faster convergence, and better performance on non-IID data distributions. Theoretical analysis supports NKD's contribution to addressing statistical heterogeneity in distributed healthcare data. The approach shows promise for privacy-sensitive medical applications under regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR, offering a balanced solution between performance and practical implementation requirements in decentralized healthcare settings.

Their convergence introduces a high-stakes systems challenge: designing standard, interoperable, and secure interfaces that allow agents to observe on-chain state, formulate transaction intents, and authorize execution without exposing users, protocols, or organizations to unacceptable security, governance, or economic risks. This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments. We conclude by proposing a reproducible evaluation suite and benchmarks for assessing the safety, reliability, and economic robustness of agent-mediated on-chain execution.",

    "abstract": "Behavior cloning is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as scaling both model and data sizes proves to provide a strong starting point for many tasks of interest. In this work, we introduce an open recipe for training a video game playing foundation model designed for inference in realtime on a consumer GPU. We release all data (8300+ hours of high quality human gameplay), training and inference code, and pretrained checkpoints under an open license. We show that our best model is capable of playing a variety of 3D video games at a level competitive with human play. We use this recipe to systematically examine the scaling laws of behavior cloning to understand how the model's performance and causal reasoning varies with model and data scale. We first show in a simple toy problem that, for some types of causal reasoning, increasing both the amount of training data and the depth of the network results in the model learning a more causal policy. We then systematically study how causality varies with the number of parameters (and depth) and training steps in scaled models of up to 1.2 billion parameters, and we find similar scaling results to what we observe in the toy problem.",

    "abstract": "Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance.\n  To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.",

Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models. We provide an ablation study, further discussions, and case studies to highlight the advancements achieved by CIEA.

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has made significant strides in overcoming key limitations of large language models, such as hallucination, lack of contextual grounding, and issues with transparency. However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows. Preliminary results from mental health risk assessment tasks indicate that this neurosymbolic approach enhances both transparency and overall performance",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents execute tasks through multi-step workflows that combine planning, memory, and tool use. While this design enables autonomy, it also expands the attack surface for backdoor threats. Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages. Building on this framework, we construct a standardized benchmark spanning four representative agent applications: \\textbf{Agent QA}, \\textbf{Agent Code}, \\textbf{Agent Web}, and \\textbf{Agent Drive}, covering both language-only and multimodal settings. Our empirical analysis shows that \\textit{triggers implanted at a single stage can persist across multiple steps and propagate through intermediate states.} For instance, when using a GPT-based backbone, we observe trigger persistence in 43.58\\% of planning attacks, 77.97\\% of memory attacks, and 60.28\\% of tool-stage attacks, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the agentic workflow itself to backdoor threats. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, our code and benchmark are publicly available at GitHub.",

Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience.

ROS introduces a Hierarchical Spatial Semantic ID (SID) that discretizes coarse-to-fine locality and POI semantics into compositional tokens, and endows LLM with a three-stage Mobility Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that models user personality, constructs an intent-aligned candidate space, and performs locality informed pruning. We further align the model with real world geography via spatial-guided Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on three widely used location-based social network (LBSN) datasets show that ROS achieves over 10% relative gains in hit rate over strongest LLM-based baselines and improves cross-city transfer, despite using a smaller backbone model.",

This approach enables pseudo-label assignment even to samples that were previously excluded from training and facilitates contrastive learning that accounts for the confidence of both anchor and positive samples in a more principled manner.

    "abstract": "Battery capacity degradation prediction has long been a central topic in battery health analytics, and most studies focus on state of health (SoH) estimation and end of life (EoL) prediction. This study extends the scope to online refinement of the entire capacity fade trajectory (CFT) through EntroLnn, a framework based on entropy-guided transformable liquid neural networks (LNNs). EntroLnn treats CFT refinement as an integrated process rather than two independent tasks for pointwise SoH and EoL. We introduce entropy-based features derived from online temperature fields, applied for the first time in battery analytics, and combine them with customized LNNs that model temporal battery dynamics effectively. The framework enhances both static and dynamic adaptability of LNNs and achieves robust and generalizable CFT refinement across different batteries and operating conditions. The approach provides a high fidelity battery health model with lightweight computation, achieving mean absolute errors of only 0.004577 for CFT and 18 cycles for EoL prediction. This work establishes a foundation for entropy-informed learning in battery analytics and enables self-adaptive, lightweight, and interpretable battery health prediction in practical battery management systems.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into social decision-making, understanding their political positioning and alignment behavior is critical for safety and fairness. This study presents a sociotechnical audit of 26 prominent LLMs, triangulating their positions across three psychometric inventories (Political Compass, SapplyValues, 8 Values) and evaluating their performance on a large-scale news labeling task ($N \\approx 27{,}000$). Our results reveal a strong clustering of models in the Libertarian-Left region of the ideological space, encompassing 96.3% of the cohort. Alignment signals appear to be consistent architectural traits rather than stochastic noise ($η^2 > 0.90$); however, we identify substantial discrepancies in measurement validity. In particular, the Political Compass exhibits a strong negative correlation with cultural progressivism ($r=-0.64$) when compared against multi-axial instruments, suggesting a conflation of social conservatism with authoritarianism in this context. We further observe a significant divergence between open-weights and closed-source models, with the latter displaying markedly higher cultural progressivism scores ($p<10^{-25}$). In downstream media analysis, models exhibit a systematic \"center-shift,\" frequently categorizing neutral articles as left-leaning, alongside an asymmetric detection capability in which \"Far Left\" content is identified with greater accuracy (19.2%) than \"Far Right\" content (2.0%). These findings suggest that single-axis evaluations are insufficient and that multidimensional auditing frameworks are necessary to characterize alignment behavior in deployed LLMs. Our code and data will be made public.",

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have become a powerful paradigm for building high performance intelligent applications. Within these systems, the router responsible for determining which expert agents should handle a given query plays a crucial role in overall performance. Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios. We have released TCAR at https://huggingface.co/tencent/TCAndon-Router to support future research on explainable and collaborative multi-agent routing.",

However, for adaptation, a critical activity during code reuse, there is no benchmark to assess LLMs' performance, leaving their practical utility in this area unclear. To fill this gap, we propose AdaptEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Unlike existing benchmarks, AdaptEval incorporates the following three distinctive features: First, Practical Context. Tasks in AdaptEval are derived from developers' practices, preserving rich contextual information from Stack Overflow and GitHub communities. Second, Multi-granularity Annotation. Each task is annotated with requirements at both task and adaptation levels, supporting the evaluation of LLMs across diverse adaptation scenarios. Third, Fine-grained Evaluation. AdaptEval includes a two-tier testing framework combining adaptation-level and function-level tests, which enables evaluating LLMs' performance across various individual adaptations. Based on AdaptEval, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate six instruction-tuned LLMs and especially three reasoning LLMs on code snippet adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptEval enables the assessment of LLMs' adaptation capabilities from various perspectives. It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions. We hope AdaptEval can facilitate further investigation and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in code snippet adaptation, supporting their real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "In recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used to model biological neural networks, noise is typically introduced during training to emulate biological variability and regularize learning. The expectation is that removing the noise at test time should preserve or improve performance. Contrary to this intuition, we find that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) often perform best at a nonzero noise level, specifically, the same level used during training. This noise preference typically arises when noise is injected inside the neural activation function; networks trained with noise injected outside the activation function perform best with zero noise. Through analyses of simple function approximation, maze navigation, and single neuron regulator tasks, we show that the phenomenon stems from noise-induced shifts of fixed points (stationary distributions) in the underlying stochastic dynamics of the RNNs. These fixed point shifts are noise-level dependent and bias the network outputs when the noise is removed, degrading performance. Analytical and numerical results show that the bias arises when neural states operate near activation function nonlinearities, where noise is asymmetrically attenuated, and that performance optimization incentivizes operation near these nonlinearities. Thus, networks can overfit to the stochastic training environment itself rather than just to the input-output data. The phenomenon is distinct from stochastic resonance, wherein nonzero noise enhances signal processing. Our findings reveal that training noise can become an integral part of the computation learned by recurrent networks, with implications for understanding neural population dynamics and for the design of robust artificial RNNs.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for text generation, watermarking has become essential for authorship attribution, intellectual property protection, and misuse detection. While existing watermarking methods perform well in high-resource languages, their robustness in low-resource languages remains underexplored. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\\times$ to 4$\\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation. Our findings quantify the robustness-quality trade-off in multilingual watermarking and establish layered watermarking as a practical, training-free solution for low-resource languages such as Bangla.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medical Question Answering (QA), yet they remain prone to hallucinations and ungrounded reasoning, limiting their reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external knowledge, conventional single-shot retrieval often fails to resolve complex biomedical queries requiring multi-step inference. To address this, we propose Self-MedRAG, a self-reflective hybrid framework designed to mimic the iterative hypothesis-verification process of clinical reasoning. Self-MedRAG integrates a hybrid retrieval strategy, combining sparse (BM25) and dense (Contriever) retrievers via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to maximize evidence coverage. It employs a generator to produce answers with supporting rationales, which are then assessed by a lightweight self-reflection module using Natural Language Inference (NLI) or LLM-based verification. If the rationale lacks sufficient evidentiary support, the system autonomously reformulates the query and iterates to refine the context. We evaluated Self-MedRAG on the MedQA and PubMedQA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our hybrid retrieval approach significantly outperforms single-retriever baselines. Furthermore, the inclusion of the self-reflective loop yielded substantial gains, increasing accuracy on MedQA from 80.00% to 83.33% and on PubMedQA from 69.10% to 79.82%. These findings confirm that integrating hybrid retrieval with iterative, evidence-based self-reflection effectively reduces unsupported claims and enhances the clinical reliability of LLM-based systems.",

On the defensive side, agentic capabilities enable continuous monitoring, autonomous incident response, adaptive threat hunting, and fraud detection at scale. Conversely, the same properties amplify adversarial power by accelerating reconnaissance, exploitation, coordination, and social-engineering attacks. These dual-use dynamics expose fundamental gaps in existing governance, assurance, and accountability mechanisms, which were largely designed for non-autonomous and short-lived AI systems. To address these challenges, we survey emerging threat models, security frameworks, and evaluation pipelines tailored to agentic systems, and analyze systemic risks including agent collusion, cascading failures, oversight evasion, and memory poisoning.

Existing benchmarks test static knowledge, failing to capture the dynamic, application-oriented capabilities required in clinical practice. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Medical LLM Benchmark MLB, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs on both foundational knowledge and scenario-based reasoning. MLB is structured around five core dimensions: Medical Knowledge (MedKQA), Safety and Ethics (MedSE), Medical Record Understanding (MedRU), Smart Services (SmartServ), and Smart Healthcare (SmartCare). The benchmark integrates 22 datasets (17 newly curated) from diverse Chinese clinical sources, covering 64 clinical specialties. Its design features a rigorous curation pipeline involving 300 licensed physicians. Besides, we provide a scalable evaluation methodology, centered on a specialized judge model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on expert annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation of 10 leading models reveals a critical translational gap: while the top-ranked model, Kimi-K2-Instruct (77.3% accuracy overall), excels in structured tasks like information extraction (87.8% accuracy in MedRU), performance plummets in patient-facing scenarios (61.3% in SmartServ). Moreover, the exceptional safety score (90.6% in MedSE) of the much smaller Baichuan-M2-32B highlights that targeted training is equally critical. Our specialized judge model, trained via SFT on a 19k expert-annotated medical dataset, achieves 92.1% accuracy, an F1-score of 94.37%, and a Cohen's Kappa of 81.3% for human-AI consistency, validating a reproducible and expert-aligned evaluation protocol. MLB thus provides a rigorous framework to guide the development of clinically viable LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Modern data systems must support accountability across persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation. This paper does not propose a specific ontology or protocol; rather, it establishes the necessary design constraints for any system intended to maintain a shared, stable representation of reality across conflicting interpretive frameworks.",

    "abstract": "The design of reliable, valid, and diverse molecules is fundamental to modern drug discovery, as improved molecular generation supports efficient exploration of the chemical space for potential drug candidates and reduces the cost of early design efforts. Despite these needs, current chemical language models that generate molecules as SMILES strings are vulnerable to compounding token errors: many samples are unparseable or chemically implausible, and hard constraints meant to prevent failure can restrict exploration. To address this gap, we introduce TSSR, a Two-Stage, Swap-Reward-driven reinforcement learning (RL) framework for character-level SMILES generation. Stage one rewards local token swaps that repair syntax, promoting transitions from invalid to parseable strings. Stage two provides chemistry-aware feedback from RDKit diagnostics, rewarding reductions in valence, aromaticity, and connectivity issues. The reward decomposes into interpretable terms (swap efficiency, error reduction, distance to validity), is model agnostic, and requires no task-specific labels or hand-crafted grammars. We evaluated TSSR on the MOSES benchmark using a GRU policy trained with PPO in both pure RL (P-RL) from random initialization and fine-tuning RL (F-RL) starting from a pretrained chemical language model, assessing 10,000 generated SMILES per run. In P-RL, TSSR significantly improves syntactic validity, chemical validity, and novelty. In F-RL, TSSR preserves drug-likeness and synthesizability while increasing validity and novelty. Token-level analysis shows that syntax edits and chemistry fixes act jointly to reduce RDKit detected errors. TSSR converts a sparse terminal objective into a denser and more interpretable reward, improving both syntactic and chemical quality without reducing diversity. TSSR is dataset-agnostic and can be adapted to various reinforcement learning approaches.",

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD.",

Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios.",

However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) enables accurate and fast molecular property predictions, which are of interest in drug discovery and material design. Their success is based on the principle of similarity at its heart, assuming that similar molecules exhibit close properties. However, activity cliffs challenge this principle, and their presence leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing ML algorithms, particularly graph-based methods. To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks. Moreover, we design a self-adaptive curriculum learning algorithm to progressively move the target model toward hard samples at a controllable pace. Extensive experiments on 30 activity cliff datasets demonstrate that SemiMol significantly enhances graph-based ML architectures and outpasses state-of-the-art pretraining and SSL baselines.",

We present CircuitLM, a novel multi-agent LLM-aided circuit design pipeline that translates user prompts into structured, visually interpretable CircuitJSON schematics through five sequential stages: (i) LLM-based component identification, (ii) canonical pinout retrieval, (iii) chain-of-thought reasoning by an electronics expert agent, (iv) JSON schematic synthesis, and (v) force-directed SVG visualization. Anchored by a curated, embedding-powered component knowledge base. While LLMs often violate electrical constraints, CircuitLM bridges this gap by grounding generation in a verified and dynamically extensible component database, initially comprising 50 components. To ensure safety, we incorporate a hybrid evaluation framework, namely Dual-Metric Circuit Validation (DMCV), validated against human-expert assessments, which achieves high fidelity in microcontroller-centric designs. We evaluate the system on 100 diverse embedded-systems prompts across six LLMs and introduce DMCV to assess both structural and electrical validity.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of wireless communications, specific emitter identification (SEI) is significant for communication security. However, its model training relies heavily on the large-scale labeled data, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an SEI approach enhanced by active learning (AL), which follows a three-stage semi-supervised training scheme. In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost.",

Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics.

To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning.

Does an LLM answer a certain way because the evidence is factually strong, because of a prior belief, or merely because it is repeated frequently? To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence. Additionally, we find that LLM explanations to group-based answers are unfaithful. Together, we show that LLMs behave consistently as vulnerable heuristic followers, with direct implications for improving RAG system design.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces StageSAT, a new approach to solving floating-point satisfiability that bridges SMT solving with numerical optimization. StageSAT reframes a floating-point formula as a series of optimization problems in three stages of increasing precision. It begins with a fast, projection-aided descent objective to guide the search toward a feasible region, proceeding to bit-level accuracy with ULP$^2$ optimization and a final $n$-ULP lattice refinement.\n  By construction, the final stage uses a representing function that is zero if and only if a candidate satisfies all constraints. Thus, when optimization drives the objective to zero, the resulting assignment is a valid solution, providing a built-in guarantee of soundness.\n  To improve search, StageSAT introduces a partial monotone descent property on linear constraints via orthogonal projection, preventing the optimizer from stalling on flat or misleading landscapes. Critically, this solver requires no heavy bit-level reasoning or specialized abstractions; it treats complex arithmetic as a black-box, using runtime evaluations to navigate the input space.\n  We implement StageSAT and evaluate it on extensive benchmarks, including SMT-COMP'25 suites and difficult cases from prior work. StageSAT proved more scalable and accurate than state-of-the-art optimization-based alternatives. It solved strictly more formulas than any competing solver under the same time budget, finding most satisfiable instances without producing spurious models. This amounts to 99.4% recall on satisfiable cases with 0% false SAT, exceeding the reliability of prior optimization-based solvers. StageSAT also delivered significant speedups (often 5--10$\\times$) over traditional bit-precise SMT and numeric solvers. These results demonstrate that staged optimization significantly improves performance and correctness of floating-point satisfiability solving.",

    "abstract": "Detection systems that utilize machine learning are progressively implemented at Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to help an analyst to filter through high volumes of security alerts. Practically, such systems tend to reveal probabilistic results or confidence scores which are ill-calibrated and hard to read when under pressure. Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks. The present paper presents a decision-sensitive trust signal correspondence scheme of SOC alert triage. The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark. According to simulation findings, false negatives are greatly amplified by the presence of misaligned displays of confidence, whereas cost weighted loss decreases by orders of magnitude between models with decision aligned trust signals. Lastly, we describe a human-in-the-loop study plan that would allow empirically assessing the decision-making of the analysts with aligned and misaligned trust interfaces.",

Instead, we posit that compliance with these regulations will only realistically be achieved computationally: that is, with algorithms that run across the life cycle of an AI system, automatically steering it toward AIR compliance in the face of dynamic conditions. Yet despite their (we would argue) inevitability, the research community has yet to specify exactly how these algorithms for computational AIR compliance should behave - or how we should benchmark their performance. To fill these gaps, we specify a set of design goals for such algorithms. In addition, we specify a benchmark dataset that can be used to quantitatively measure whether individual algorithms satisfy these design goals.

First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions). Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional \"Austral Tower\" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge. Overall, Concept Tokens provide a compact control signal learned from definitions that can steer behavior in frozen LLMs.",

Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is \"ahead-of-time\", acting as a blind \"feed-forward\" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually \"one-off\", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost.",

    "abstract": "We develop a categorical foundation for belief propagation on factor graphs. We construct the free hypergraph category \\(\\Syn_Σ\\) on a typed signature and prove its universal property, yielding compositional semantics via a unique functor to the matrix category \\(\\cat{Mat}_R\\). Message-passing is formulated using a Grothendieck fibration \\(\\int\\Msg \\to \\cat{FG}_Σ\\) over polarized factor graphs, with schedule-indexed endomorphisms defining BP updates. We characterize exact inference as effective descent: local beliefs form a descent datum when compatibility conditions hold on overlaps. This framework unifies tree exactness, junction tree algorithms, and loopy BP failures under sheaf-theoretic obstructions. We introduce HATCC (Holonomy-Aware Tree Compilation), an algorithm that detects descent obstructions via holonomy computation on the factor nerve, compiles non-trivial holonomy into mode variables, and reduces to tree BP on an augmented graph. Complexity is \\(O(n^2 d_{\\max} + c \\cdot k_{\\max} \\cdot δ_{\\max}^3 + n \\cdot δ_{\\max}^2)\\) for \\(n\\) factors and \\(c\\) fundamental cycles. Experimental results demonstrate exact inference with significant speedup over junction trees on grid MRFs and random graphs, along with UNSAT detection on satisfiability instances.",

    "abstract": "Using large language models (LLMs) to predict relevance judgments has shown promising results. Most studies treat this task as a distinct research line, e.g., focusing on prompt design for predicting relevance labels given a query and passage. However, predicting relevance judgments is essentially a form of relevance prediction, a problem extensively studied in tasks such as re-ranking. Despite this potential overlap, little research has explored reusing or adapting established re-ranking methods to predict relevance judgments, leading to potential resource waste and redundant development. To bridge this gap, we reproduce re-rankers in a re-ranker-as-relevance-judge setup. We design two adaptation strategies: (i) using binary tokens (e.g., \"true\" and \"false\") generated by a re-ranker as direct judgments, and (ii) converting continuous re-ranking scores into binary labels via thresholding. We perform extensive experiments on TREC-DL 2019 to 2023 with 8 re-rankers from 3 families, ranging from 220M to 32B, and analyse the evaluation bias exhibited by re-ranker-based judges. Results show that re-ranker-based relevance judges, under both strategies, can outperform UMBRELA, a state-of-the-art LLM-based relevance judge, in around 40% to 50% of the cases; they also exhibit strong self-preference towards their own and same-family re-rankers, as well as cross-family bias.",

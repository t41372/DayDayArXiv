    "abstract": "Generative models have shown impressive capabilities in synthesizing\nhigh-quality outputs across various domains. However, a persistent challenge is\nthe occurrence of \"hallucinations\", where the model produces outputs that are\nplausible but invalid. While empirical strategies have been explored to\nmitigate this issue, a rigorous theoretical understanding remains elusive. In\nthis paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the learnability of\nnon-hallucinating generative models from a learning-theoretic perspective. Our\nresults reveal that non-hallucinating learning is statistically impossible when\nrelying solely on the training dataset, even for a hypothesis class of size two\nand when the entire training set is truthful. To overcome these limitations, we\nshow that incorporating inductive biases aligned with the actual facts into the\nlearning process is essential. We provide a systematic approach to achieve this\nby restricting the facts set to a concept class of finite VC-dimension and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness under various learning paradigms. Although our\nfindings are primarily conceptual, they represent a first step towards a\nprincipled approach to addressing hallucinations in learning generative models.",

Since human values can be personalized and dynamically\nchange over time, the desirable levels of value alignment vary across different\nethnic groups, industry sectors, and user cohorts. Within existing frameworks,\nit is hard to define human values and align AI systems accordingly across\ndifferent directions simultaneously, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and\npositiveness. To address this, we develop a novel, first-principle approach\ncalled Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP), which navigates the alignment\nacross multiple human values in a structured and reliable way. MAP formulates\nthe alignment problem as an optimization task with user-defined constraints,\nwhich define human value targets. It can be efficiently solved via a\nprimal-dual approach, which determines whether a user-defined alignment target\nis achievable and how to achieve it. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis\nof MAP by quantifying the trade-offs between values, the sensitivity to\nconstraints, the fundamental connection between multi-value alignment and\nsequential alignment, and proving that linear weighted rewards are sufficient\nfor multi-value alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP's ability to\nalign multiple values in a principled manner while delivering strong empirical\nperformance across various tasks.",

    "abstract": "Large language models demonstrate impressive proficiency in language\nunderstanding and generation. Nonetheless, training these models from scratch,\neven the least complex billion-parameter variant demands significant\ncomputational resources rendering it economically impractical for many\norganizations. With large language models functioning as general-purpose task\nsolvers, this paper investigates their task-specific fine-tuning. We employ\ntask-specific datasets and prompts to fine-tune two pruned LLaMA models having\n5 billion and 4 billion parameters. This process utilizes the pre-trained\nweights and focuses on a subset of weights using the LoRA method. One challenge\nin fine-tuning the LLaMA model is crafting a precise prompt tailored to the\nspecific task. To address this, we propose a novel approach to fine-tune the\nLLaMA model under two primary constraints: task specificity and prompt\neffectiveness. Our approach, Tailored LLaMA initially employs structural\npruning to reduce the model sizes from 7B to 5B and 4B parameters.\nSubsequently, it applies a carefully designed prompt specific to the task and\nutilizes the LoRA method to accelerate the fine-tuning process. Moreover,\nfine-tuning a model pruned by 50\\% for less than one hour restores the mean\naccuracy of classification tasks to 95.68\\% at a 20\\% compression ratio and to\n86.54\\% at a 50\\% compression ratio through few-shot learning with 50 shots.\nOur validation of Tailored LLaMA on these two pruned variants demonstrates that\neven when compressed to 50\\%, the models maintain over 65\\% of the baseline\nmodel accuracy in few-shot classification and generation tasks. These findings\nhighlight the efficacy of our tailored approach in maintaining high performance\nwith significantly reduced model sizes.",

However, many existing agent benchmarks neglect long-context video\nunderstanding, instead focusing on text or static image inputs. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce VideoWebArena (VideoWA), a benchmark for evaluating the\ncapabilities of long-context multimodal agents for video understanding. VideoWA\nconsists of 2,021 web agent tasks based on manually crafted video tutorials,\nwhich total almost four hours of content. For our benchmark, we define a\ntaxonomy of long-context video-based agent tasks with two main areas of focus:\nskill retention and factual retention. While skill retention tasks evaluate\nwhether an agent can use a given human demonstration to complete a task\nefficiently, the factual retention task evaluates whether an agent can retrieve\ninstruction-relevant information from a video to complete a task. We find that\nthe best model achieves 13.3% success on factual retention tasks and 45.8% on\nfactual retention QA pairs, far below human performance at 73.9% and 79.3%,\nrespectively. On skill retention tasks, long-context models perform worse with\ntutorials than without, exhibiting a 5% performance decrease in WebArena tasks\nand a 10.3% decrease in VisualWebArena tasks.

We\nconsider discrete image registration when the underlying function is a\none-dimensional spatially-limited piecewise constant function.

Therefore, if\nthe samples of the function are noisy, then image registration requires\nalignment and segmentation of the data sequences. One popular strategy for\naligning images is selecting the maximum from cross-correlation template\nmatching. To motivate more robust and accurate approaches which also address\nsegmentation, we provide an example of a one-dimensional spatially-limited\npiecewise constant function for which the cross-correlation technique can\nperform poorly on noisy samples.

    "abstract": "With the growing spread of misinformation online, research has increasingly\nfocused on detecting and tracking fake news. However, an overlooked issue is\nthat fake news does not naturally exist in social networks -- it often\noriginates from distorted facts or deliberate fabrication by malicious actors.\nUnderstanding how true news gradually evolves into fake news is critical for\nearly detection and prevention, reducing its spread and impact. Hence, in this\npaper, we take the first step toward simulating and revealing this evolution,\nproposing a Fake News evolUtion Simulation framEwork (FUSE) based on large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Specifically, we employ LLM as agents to represent\nindividuals in a simulated social network. We define four types of agents\ncommonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders, who propagate information;\ncommentators, who provide opinions and interpretations; verifiers, who check\nthe accuracy of information; and bystanders, who passively observe without\nengaging. For simulated environments, we model various social network\nstructures, such as high-clustering networks and scale-free networks, to mirror\nreal-world network dynamics. Each day, the agents engage in belief exchanges,\nreflect on their thought processes, and reintroduce the news accordingly. Given\nthe lack of prior work in this area, we developed a FUSE-EVAL evaluation\nframework to measure the deviation from true news during the fake news\nevolution process. The results show that FUSE successfully captures the\nunderlying patterns of how true news transforms into fake news and accurately\nreproduces previously discovered instances of fake news, aligning closely with\nhuman evaluations. Moreover, our work provides insights into the fact that\ncombating fake news should not be delayed until it has fully evolved; instead,\nprevention in advance is key to achieving better outcomes.",

We propose\na method that transcends this limitation, switching the focus from analyzing a\nmodel's predictions to analyzing the model's weights, the mechanism behind the\nmaking of the decisions, which proves to be more insightful. Our proposed\nWeight-space Approach to detecting Spuriousness (WASP) relies on analyzing the\nweights of foundation models as they drift towards capturing various (spurious)\ncorrelations while being fine-tuned on a given dataset. We demonstrate that\ndifferent from previous works, our method (i) can expose spurious correlations\nfeatured by a dataset even when they are not exposed by training or validation\ncounterexamples, (ii) it works for multiple modalities such as image and text,\nand (iii) it can uncover previously untapped spurious correlations learned by\nImageNet-1k classifiers.",

Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the\nefficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate\nlayers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence\nestimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing\nthe efficiency gains.

To this\nend, we generate data on how loud an 'impulse' sounds at different listener\nlocations in simulated homes, and train our Acoustic Noise Predictor (ANP).\nNext, we collect acoustic profiles corresponding to different actions for\nnavigation.

We evaluate a broad spectrum of LLMs, including open-source,\nclosed-source, and math-specialized models, using FaultyMath across three\ndimensions: (i) How accurately can the models detect faulty math problems\nwithout being explicitly prompted to do so? (ii) When provided with hints --\neither correct or misleading -- about the validity of the problems, to what\nextent do LLMs adapt to become reliable Logical Thinker? (iii) How trustworthy\nare the explanations generated by LLMs when they recognize a math problem as\nflawed?

    "abstract": "In this innovative practice full paper, we address the equity gap for\nneurodivergent and situationally limited learners by identifying the spectrum\nof dynamic factors that impact learning and function. Educators have shown a\ngrowing interest in identifying learners' cognitive abilities and learning\npreferences to measure their impact on academic achievement. Often institutions\nemploy one-size-fits-all approaches leaving the burden on disabled students to\nself-advocate or tolerate inadequate support. Emerging frameworks guide\nneurodivergent learners through instructional approaches, such as online\neducation. However, these frameworks fail to address holistic environmental\nneeds or recommend technology interventions, particularly for those with\nundisclosed learning or developmental disabilities and situational limitations.\nIn this article, we integrate a neurodivergent perspective through secondary\nresearch of around 100 articles to introduce a Guiding Empowerment Model\ninvolving key cognitive and situational factors that contextualize day-to-day\nexperiences affecting learner ability. We synthesize three sample student\nprofiles that highlight user problems in functioning. We use this model to\nevaluate sample learning platform features and other supportive technology\nsolutions. The proposed approach augments frameworks such as Universal Design\nfor Learning to consider factors including various sensory processing\ndifferences, social connection challenges, and environmental limitations. We\nsuggest that by applying the mode through technology-enabled features such as\ncustomizable task management, guided varied content access, and guided\nmulti-modal collaboration, major learning barriers of neurodivergent and\nsituationally limited learners will be removed to activate the successful\npursuit of their academic goals.",

In this paper, we explore\nstudent's awareness and engagement with AI in the context of school and their\ndaily lives. Over six weeks, 22 undergraduate students participated in a\nreflective journal study and submitted a weekly journal entry about their\ninteractions with AI. The participants were recruited from a technology and\nsociety course that focuses on the implications of technology on people,\ncommunities, and processes. In their weekly journal entries, participants\nreflected on interactions with AI on campus (coursework, advertises campus\nevents, or seminars) and beyond (social media, news, or conversations with\nfriends and family). The journal prompts were designed to help them think\nthrough what they had read, watched, or been told and reflect on the\ndevelopment of their own perspectives, knowledge, and literacy on the topic.\nOverall, students described nine categories of interactions: coursework, news\nand current events, using software and applications, university events, social\nmedia related to their work, personal discussions with friends and family,\ninteracting with content, and gaming. Students reported that completing the\ndiaries allowed them time for reflection and made them more aware of the\npresence of AI in their daily lives and of its potential benefits and\ndrawbacks. This research contributes to the ongoing work on AI awareness and\nliteracy by bringing in perspectives from beyond a formal educational context.",

The complexity of this\ntask leads to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities in highly dynamic\nsystems where arriving requests must be continuously scheduled subject to\nstrong safety and time constraints. An example of such a system is an\nunsignalized intersection, where automated vehicles' access to potential\nconflict zones must be dynamically scheduled. In this paper, we apply Neural\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (NMCTS) to the challenging task of scheduling platoons\nof vehicles crossing unsignalized intersections. Crucially, we introduce a\ntransformation model that maps successive sequences of potentially conflicting\nroad-space reservation requests from platoons of vehicles into a series of\nboard-game-like problems and use NMCTS to search for solutions representing\noptimal road-space allocation schedules in the context of past allocations. To\noptimize search, we incorporate a prioritized re-sampling method with parallel\nNMCTS (PNMCTS) to improve the quality of training data. To optimize training, a\ncurriculum learning strategy is used to train the agent to schedule\nprogressively more complex boards culminating in overlapping boards that\nrepresent busy intersections. In a busy single four-way unsignalized\nintersection simulation, PNMCTS solved 95\\% of unseen scenarios, reducing\ncrossing time by 43\\% in light and 52\\% in heavy traffic versus first-in,\nfirst-out control.

Current methods mainly focus on\nreliability, generalization, and locality, with many methods excelling across\nthese criteria. Some recent works disclose the pitfalls of these editing\nmethods such as knowledge distortion or conflict. However, the general\nabilities of post-edited language models remain unexplored. In this paper, we\nperform a comprehensive evaluation on various editing methods and different\nlanguage models, and have following findings. (1) Existing editing methods lead\nto inevitable performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that\nexisting editing methods maintain the general abilities of the model within\nonly a few dozen edits. When the number of edits is slightly large, the\nintrinsic knowledge structure of the model is disrupted or even completely\ndamaged. (2) Instruction-tuned models are more robust to editing, showing less\nperformance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language model with\nlarge scale is more resistant to editing compared to small model. (4) The\nsafety of the edited model, is significantly weakened, even for those\nsafety-aligned models. Our findings indicate that current editing methods are\nonly suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which\nmotivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods.

These models can\ndistort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to\ncopyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first\ncomprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking\nmethods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image\nregeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation.\nThrough extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods\nagainst prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to\ndetect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose\nVINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against\nvarious image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our\napproach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency\ncharacteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit\nsimilar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks\nduring training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale\npretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to\nachieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results\nshow that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under\nvarious image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image\nquality and robustness.

When adapting large models\nto specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant\nchallenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power\nand GPU memory.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence\n(XAI) techniques aim to address these issues. However, explainability can mean\ndifferent things to people with different backgrounds, expertise, and goals. To\naddress the target audience with diverse needs, we develop storytelling XAI.

We contribute to this ongoing discussion by introducing\nLITEVAL-CORPUS, a paragraph-level parallel corpus containing verified human\ntranslations and outputs from 9 MT systems, which totals over 2k translations\nand 13k evaluated sentences across four language pairs, costing 4.5k C. This\ncorpus enables us to (i) examine the consistency and adequacy of human\nevaluation schemes with various degrees of complexity, (ii) compare evaluations\nby students and professionals, assess the effectiveness of (iii) LLM-based\nmetrics and (iv) LLMs themselves. Our findings indicate that the adequacy of\nhuman evaluation is controlled by two factors: the complexity of the evaluation\nscheme (more complex is less adequate) and the expertise of evaluators (higher\nexpertise yields more adequate evaluations). For instance, MQM\n(Multidimensional Quality Metrics), a complex scheme and the de facto standard\nfor non-literary human MT evaluation, is largely inadequate for literary\ntranslation evaluation: with student evaluators, nearly 60% of human\ntranslations are misjudged as indistinguishable or inferior to machine\ntranslations. In contrast, BWS (BEST-WORST SCALING), a much simpler scheme,\nidentifies human translations at a rate of 80-100%. Automatic metrics fare\ndramatically worse, with rates of at most 20%.

Recent studies emphasize the importance of\noptimizing Data Augmentation (DA) parameters along with AN, which poses a\ngreater threat to real-world AI applications. However, existing DA-based\nstrategies often struggle to find optimal solutions due to the challenging DA\nsearch procedure without proper guidance. In this work, we propose a novel\nDA-based attack algorithm, GADT. GADT identifies suitable DA parameters through\niterative antagonism and uses posterior estimates to update AN based on these\nparameters. We uniquely employ a differentiable DA operation library to\nidentify adversarial DA parameters and introduce a new loss function as a\nmetric during DA optimization. This loss term enhances adversarial effects\nwhile preserving the original image content, maintaining attack crypticity.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets with various networks demonstrate that\nGADT can be integrated with existing transferable attack methods, updating\ntheir DA parameters effectively while retaining their AN formulation\nstrategies. Furthermore, GADT can be utilized in other black-box attack\nscenarios, e.g., query-based attacks, offering a new avenue to enhance attacks\non real-world AI applications in both research and industrial contexts.",

The use of a Smart ETL (Extract,\nTransform, and Load) process, where \\emph{Smart} indicates the use of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), is central to this endeavor.\n  Methods: The contents describing STTs are derived from PDF catalogs, where\nPDF-scraping techniques extract QR codes, images, links, and text information.\nDuplicate STTs between the catalogs are removed, and the remaining ones are\nclassified based on their text information using Large Language Models (LLMs).\nFinally, the data is transformed to comply with the Dublin Core metadata\nstructure (the observatory's metadata structure), chosen for its wide\nacceptance and flexibility.\n  Results: The Smart ETL process to import STTs to the observatory combines\nPDF-scraping techniques with LLMs for text content-based classification. Our\npreliminary results have demonstrated the potential of LLMs for text\ncontent-based classification.\n  Conclusion: The proposed approach's feasibility is a step towards efficient\ncontent-based classification, not only in Smart Tourism but also adaptable to\nother fields.

    "abstract": "As diffusion models become increasingly popular, the misuse of copyrighted\nand private images has emerged as a major concern. One promising solution to\nmitigate this issue is identifying the contribution of specific training\nsamples in generative models, a process known as data attribution. Existing\ndata attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the\ncontribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss\nwhen the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we\nargue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a\ncontribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss. Specifically,\nthese approaches measure the divergence between predicted and ground truth\ndistributions, which leads to an indirect comparison between the predicted\ndistributions and cannot represent the variances between model behaviors. To\naddress these issues, we aim to measure the direct comparison between predicted\ndistributions with an attribution score to analyse the training sample\nimportance, which is achieved by Diffusion Attribution Score (\\textit{DAS}).\nUnderpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, we elucidate the effectiveness of\nDAS. Additionally, we explore strategies to accelerate DAS calculations,\nfacilitating its application to large-scale diffusion models. Our extensive\nexperiments across various datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that DAS\nsignificantly surpasses previous benchmarks in terms of the linear\ndata-modelling score, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Specifically, this approach leverages readily\navailable reference images to learn inclusive prompts for each target Sensitive\nAttribute (tSA), allowing for fair image generation. In this work, we first\nreveal that this prompt learning-based approach results in degraded sample\nquality. Our analysis shows that the approach's training objective -- which\naims to align the embedding differences of learned prompts and reference images\n-- could be sub-optimal, resulting in distortion of the learned prompts and\ndegraded generated images. To further substantiate this claim, as our major\ncontribution, we deep dive into the denoising subnetwork of the T2I model to\ntrack down the effect of these learned prompts by analyzing the cross-attention\nmaps. In our analysis, we propose a novel prompt switching analysis: I2H and\nH2I. Furthermore, we propose new quantitative characterization of\ncross-attention maps. Our analysis reveals abnormalities in the early denoising\nsteps, perpetuating improper global structure that results in degradation in\nthe generated samples. Building on insights from our analysis, we propose two\nideas: (i) Prompt Queuing and (ii) Attention Amplification to address the\nquality issue.

    "abstract": "We have released an open dataset with global coverage on road surface\ncharacteristics (paved or unpaved) derived utilising 105 million images from\nthe world's largest crowdsourcing-based street view platform, Mapillary,\nleveraging state-of-the-art geospatial AI methods. We propose a hybrid deep\nlearning approach which combines SWIN-Transformer based road surface prediction\nand CLIP-and-DL segmentation based thresholding for filtering of bad quality\nimages. The road surface prediction results have been matched and integrated\nwith OpenStreetMap (OSM) road geometries. This study provides global data\ninsights derived from maps and statistics about spatial distribution of\nMapillary coverage and road pavedness on a continent and countries scale, with\nrural and urban distinction. This dataset expands the availability of global\nroad surface information by over 3 million kilometers, now representing\napproximately 36% of the total length of the global road network. Most regions\nshowed moderate to high paved road coverage (60-80%), but significant gaps were\nnoted in specific areas of Africa and Asia. Urban areas tend to have\nnear-complete paved coverage, while rural regions display more variability.\nModel validation against OSM surface data achieved strong performance, with F1\nscores for paved roads between 91-97% across continents. Taking forward the\nwork of Mapillary and their contributors and enrichment of OSM road attributes,\nour work provides valuable insights for applications in urban planning,\ndisaster routing, logistics optimisation and addresses various Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGS): especially SDGs 1 (No poverty), 3 (Good health and\nwell-being), 8 (Decent work and economic growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and\nInfrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), 12 (Responsible\nconsumption and production), and 13 (Climate action).",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can transfer their reasoning skills to smaller\nmodels by teaching them to generate the intermediate reasoning process required\nto solve multistep reasoning tasks. While LLMs can accurately solve reasoning\ntasks through a variety of strategies, even without fine-tuning, smaller models\nare not expressive enough to fit the LLMs distribution on all strategies when\ndistilled and tend to prioritize one strategy over the others. This reliance on\none strategy poses a challenge for smaller models when attempting to solve\nreasoning tasks that may be difficult with their preferred strategy. To address\nthis, we propose a distillation method SIKeD (Self-guided Iterative Knowledge\nDistillation for mathematical reasoning), where the LLM teaches the smaller\nmodel to approach a task using different strategies and the smaller model uses\nits self-generated on-policy outputs to choose the most suitable strategy for\nthe given task. The training continues in a self-guided iterative manner, where\nfor each training iteration, a decision is made on how to combine the LLM data\nwith the self-generated outputs. Unlike traditional distillation methods, SIKeD\nallows the smaller model to learn which strategy is suitable for a given task\nwhile continuously learning to solve a task using different strategies. Our\nexperiments on various mathematical reasoning datasets show that SIKeD\nsignificantly outperforms traditional distillation techniques across smaller\nmodels of different sizes.

This inconsistency\nacross XAI methods has been evaluated using predefined metrics designed to\nquantify agreement levels between them, revealing significant disagreement.\nThis impedes the reliability and interpretability of XAI in this area.

    "abstract": "Context Progresses in GNSS-based solution introduction in rail applications\nGNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is now used in most of our travels\nand each of our smartphone apps. Most of the usages are not safety-critical.\nBut Europe identified GNSS for more applications and to be integrated in rail\nin general as part of the toolset to help railway to contribute to reduce\ntransport carbon footprint. To increase the use of trains in European\ntransports, railways must improve their attractiveness for passengers and\nfreight, but also increase reliability, availability and efficiency by reducing\ncapital expenditure and operational costs. GNSS is part of the global\ndigitalization scheme of freight that aims to offer added value to the clients\nknowledge of accurate time of arrival, continuous monitoring of transport\nconditions (temperature, humidity...). But a major challenge will be to reach\nstringent applications and in particular, GNSS is today seen as a realistic and\nserious game changer for the future of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic\nManagement System). The localisation function is today performed with both\nodometry and balises. Odometer provides a continuous train position in time\nfrom a reference point. But as the distance delivered by the odometer shows a\ngrowing bias with distance, due to wear and wheel sliding, the use of on-track\nbalises allows to reduce this error. Future systems will be based on on-board\nlocalisation solutions with GNSS receivers. It will allow the development of\nnew concepts for moving blocks, virtual coupling and automation. Its use for\ntrain integrity is also investigated. But the environmental conditions of track\nand surroundings configuration, i.e, tunnels, dense urban areas or vegetation\noften degrade positioning performance and thus its efficiency and safety.\nIndeed, GNSS satellites are moving and their visibility (availability and\nrelative position from the receiver) vary with time. Moreover, for optimal\nperformance, the system requires open sky environments, which are the cases of\nmost of the aeronautical uses but not of train uses. Trains often circulate in\nareas where signal reception can be disturbed (multipath, intentional or\nunintentional interferences) and thus, performances degraded. If many\nprogresses have been made in the past years to develop more robust receivers\n[Puccitelli, 2022], multi-sensor solutions [CLUG website] or missing tools such\nas Digital Maps [Crespillo, 2023], in projects such as the Shift2Rail Project\nX2Rail-5 or CLUG, some questions remain and in particular related to\nperformance evaluation. How can we evaluate performances in a dynamic\nenvironment (train, satellite, obstacles)? How can we be sure that every\nconfiguration has been tested? What is the impact of a failure (inaccuracy,\nmissed detection) on operation? Some of these issues are addressed in the\non-going R2DATO project funded by Europe's rail.",

This study probes how lsAGC can\naccurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension\nreduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts\ntime-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among\nfMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of\nthe inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset\nof 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction\nConnectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain\nconnections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A\nGraph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification\ntask, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize\nintricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for\nfMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a\nfive-fold cross-validation system.

After traditional statistical and machine learning approaches,\nvarious fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and\nGNNs have been developed.

Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term\ndependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series\nforecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as\nsimple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up\nnew possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental\ndeep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this\ncontext, architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a\nrenaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series\nforecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement\ntoward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining deep\nlearning models, we uncover new perspectives and present recent trends,\nincluding hybrid, diffusion, Mamba, and foundation models.

This approach enhances the\nflexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers\nagility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment\nenvironments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle\nFleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly\nreducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL)\nfor code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for\ncommunication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation\ncapabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and\nPADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated\ncode verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements\nin agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived\nfrom a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by\nboth OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology\nconstrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its\ncyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that\nadditional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the\nhigh risk threshold for complexity.",

In this\npaper, we introduce Dialog2Flow (D2F) embeddings, which differ from\nconventional sentence embeddings by mapping utterances to a latent space where\nthey are grouped according to their communicative and informative functions\n(i.e., the actions they represent). D2F allows for modeling dialogs as\ncontinuous trajectories in a latent space with distinct action-related regions.\nBy clustering D2F embeddings, the latent space is quantized, and dialogs can be\nconverted into sequences of region/action IDs, facilitating the extraction of\nthe underlying workflow.

Traditional approaches, whether\nknowledge-based or model-based, are notably time-consuming and labor-intensive,\ndue to the vast scale of research literature and the approximation nature of\ngenome-scale metabolic model (GEM) simulations. Therefore, we propose a new\ntask, Gene-Metabolite Association Prediction based on metabolic graphs, to\nautomate the process of candidate gene discovery for a given pair of metabolite\nand candidate-associated genes, as well as presenting the first benchmark\ncontaining 2474 metabolites and 1947 genes of two commonly used microorganisms\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and Issatchenkia orientalis (IO). This task is\nchallenging due to the incompleteness of the metabolic graphs and the\nheterogeneity among distinct metabolisms. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose an Interactive Knowledge Transfer mechanism based on Metabolism Graph\n(IKT4Meta), which improves the association prediction accuracy by integrating\nthe knowledge from different metabolism graphs. First, to build a bridge\nbetween two graphs for knowledge transfer, we utilize Pretrained Language\nModels (PLMs) with external knowledge of genes and metabolites to help generate\ninter-graph links, significantly alleviating the impact of heterogeneity.\nSecond, we propagate intra-graph links from different metabolic graphs using\ninter-graph links as anchors. Finally, we conduct the gene-metabolite\nassociation prediction based on the enriched metabolism graphs, which integrate\nthe knowledge from multiple microorganisms. Experiments on both types of\norganisms demonstrate that our proposed methodology outperforms baselines by up\nto 12.3% across various link prediction frameworks.",

Missed bugs can cause drastic failures in\nsafety-critical environments leading to the endangerment of lives. To overcome\nthese drastic failures, formal property verification (FPV) has been applied in\nthe industry. However, there exist multiple hardware designs where the results\nof FPV are not conclusive even for long runtimes of model-checking tools. For\nthis reason, the use of High-level Equivalence Checking (HLEC) tools has been\nproposed in the last few years. However, the procedure for how to use it inside\nan industrial toolchain has not been defined. For this reason, we proposed an\nautomated methodology based on metamodeling techniques which consist of two\nmain steps. First, an untimed algorithmic description written in C++ is\nverified in an early stage using generated assertions; the advantage of this\nstep is that the assertions at the software level run in seconds and we can\nstart our analysis with conclusive results about our algorithm before starting\nto write the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design. Second, this algorithmic\ndescription is verified against its sequential design using HLEC and the\nrespective metamodel parameters. The results show that the presented\nmethodology can find bugs early related to the algorithmic description and\nprepare the setup for the HLEC verification. This helps to reduce the\nverification efforts to set up the tool and write the properties manually which\nis always error-prone.

MoMQ employs a dialect expert group for each dialect\nand a multi-level routing strategy to handle dialect-specific knowledge,\nreducing interference during query generation. Additionally, a shared expert\ngroup is introduced to address data imbalance, facilitating the transfer of\ncommon knowledge from high-resource dialects to low-resource ones. Furthermore,\nwe have developed a high-quality multi-dialect query generation benchmark that\ncovers relational and non-relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL,\nCypher for Neo4j, and nGQL for NebulaGraph. Extensive experiments have shown\nthat MoMQ performs effectively and robustly even in resource-imbalanced\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent advancements in information retrieval (IR), zero-shot IR\nremains a significant challenge, especially when dealing with new domains,\nlanguages, and newly-released use cases that lack historical query traffic from\nexisting users. For such cases, it is common to use query augmentations\nfollowed by fine-tuning pre-trained models on the document data paired with\nsynthetic queries. In this work, we propose a novel Universal Document Linking\n(UDL) algorithm, which links similar documents to enhance synthetic query\ngeneration across multiple datasets with different characteristics. UDL\nleverages entropy for the choice of similarity models and named entity\nrecognition (NER) for the link decision of documents using similarity scores.\nOur empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the UDL\nacross diverse datasets and IR models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in\nzero-shot cases.

    "abstract": "The segmentation-free research efforts for addressing handwritten text\nrecognition can be divided into three categories: connectionist temporal\nclassification (CTC), hidden Markov model and encoder-decoder methods. In this\npaper, inspired by the above three modeling methods, we propose a new\nrecognition network by using a novel three-dimensional (3D) attention module\nand global-local context information. Based on the feature maps of the last\nconvolutional layer, a series of 3D blocks with different resolutions are\nsplit. Then, these 3D blocks are fed into the 3D attention module to generate\nsequential visual features. Finally, by integrating the visual features and the\ncorresponding global-local context features, a well-designed representation can\nbe obtained. Main canonical neural units including attention mechanisms,\nfully-connected layer, recurrent unit and convolutional layer are efficiently\norganized into a network and can be jointly trained by the CTC loss and the\ncross-entropy loss. Experiments on the latest Chinese handwritten text datasets\n(the SCUT-HCCDoc and the SCUT-EPT) and one English handwritten text dataset\n(the IAM) show that the proposed method can make a new milestone.",

    "abstract": "Audio can disclose PII, particularly when combined with related text data.\nTherefore, it is essential to develop tools to detect privacy leakage in\nContrastive Language-Audio Pretraining(CLAP). Existing MIAs need audio as\ninput, risking exposure of voiceprint and requiring costly shadow models. We\nfirst propose PRMID, a membership inference detector based probability ranking\ngiven by CLAP, which does not require training shadow models but still requires\nboth audio and text of the individual as input. To address these limitations,\nwe then propose USMID, a textual unimodal speaker-level membership inference\ndetector, querying the target model using only text data. We randomly generate\ntextual gibberish that are clearly not in training dataset. Then we extract\nfeature vectors from these texts using the CLAP model and train a set of\nanomaly detectors on them. During inference, the feature vector of each test\ntext is input into the anomaly detector to determine if the speaker is in the\ntraining set (anomalous) or not (normal). If available, USMID can further\nenhance detection by integrating real audio of the tested speaker. Extensive\nexperiments on various CLAP model architectures and datasets demonstrate that\nUSMID outperforms baseline methods using only text data.",

Existing DSE frameworks\nstruggle in large-scale design spaces due to inaccurate models and limited\ninsights into parameter impact, hindering efficient identification of optimal\nmicro-architectures within tight timeframes.\n  In this work, we introduce AttentionDSE. Its key idea is to use the attention\nmechanism to establish a direct mapping of micro-architectural parameters to\ntheir contributions to predicted performance. This approach enhances both the\nprediction accuracy and interpretability of the performance model. Furthermore,\nthe weights are dynamically adjusted, enabling the model to respond to design\nchanges and effectively pinpoint the key micro-architectural\nparameters/components responsible for performance bottlenecks. Thus,\nAttentionDSE accurately, purposefully, and rapidly discovers optimal designs.\nExperiments on SPEC 2017 demonstrate that AttentionDSE significantly reduces\nexploration time by over 80\\% and achieves 3.9\\% improvement in Pareto\nHypervolume compared to state-of-the-art DSE frameworks while maintaining\nsuperior prediction accuracy and efficiency with an increasing number of\nparameters.",

    "abstract": "OpenAI's Whisper Automated Speech Recognition model excels in generalizing\nacross diverse datasets and domains.

To validate our approach, we conducted\nexperiments using a validation dataset comprising maritime data collected\nwithin a simulated training environment. A comparison between the original\nWhisper models of varying parameter sizes and our biased model revealed a\nnotable reduction in transcription word error rate and enhanced performance of\ndownstream applications.

To develop planners that are complete and optimal\nfor PAMO, the planner has to search a giant state space involving both the\nlocation of the robot as well as the locations of the objects, which grows\nexponentially with respect to the number of objects. This paper leverages a\nsimple yet under-explored idea that, only a small fraction of this giant state\nspace needs to be searched during planning as guided by a heuristic, and most\nof the objects far away from the robot are intact, which thus leads to runtime\nefficient algorithms. Based on this idea, this paper introduces two PAMO\nformulations, i.e., bi-objective and resource constrained problems in an\noccupancy grid, and develops PAMO*, a planning method with completeness and\nsolution optimality guarantees, to solve the two problems. We then further\nextend PAMO* to hybrid-state PAMO* to plan in continuous spaces with\nhigh-fidelity interaction between the robot and the objects.

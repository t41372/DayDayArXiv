    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have proven effective in a wide\nrange of tasks requiring complex reasoning and linguistic comprehension.\nHowever, due to a lack of high-quality multimodal resources in languages other\nthan English, success of MLLMs remains relatively limited to English-based\nsettings. This poses significant challenges in developing comparable models for\nother languages, including even those with large speaker populations such as\nArabic. To alleviate this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive family of\nArabic MLLMs, dubbed \\textit{Peacock}, with strong vision and language\ncapabilities. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis, we\ndemonstrate the solid performance of our models on various visual reasoning\ntasks and further show their emerging dialectal potential. Additionally, we\nintroduce ~\\textit{Henna}, a new benchmark specifically designed for assessing\nMLLMs on aspects related to Arabic culture, setting the first stone for\nculturally-aware Arabic MLLMs.The GitHub repository for the \\textit{Peacock}\nproject is available at \\url{https://github.com/UBC-NLP/peacock}.",

    "abstract": "In a sequential decision-making problem, the information structure is the\ndescription of how events in the system occurring at different points in time\naffect each other. Classical models of reinforcement learning (e.g., MDPs,\nPOMDPs) assume a simple and highly regular information structure, while more\ngeneral models like predictive state representations do not explicitly model\nthe information structure. By contrast, real-world sequential decision-making\nproblems typically involve a complex and time-varying interdependence of system\nvariables, requiring a rich and flexible representation of information\nstructure. In this paper, we formalize a novel reinforcement learning model\nwhich explicitly represents the information structure. We then use this model\nto carry out an information-structural analysis of the statistical hardness of\ngeneral sequential decision-making problems, obtaining a characterization via a\ngraph-theoretic quantity of the DAG representation of the information\nstructure. We prove an upper bound on the sample complexity of learning a\ngeneral sequential decision-making problem in terms of its information\nstructure by exhibiting an algorithm achieving the upper bound. This recovers\nknown tractability results and gives a novel perspective on reinforcement\nlearning in general sequential decision-making problems, providing a systematic\nway of identifying new tractable classes of problems.",

    "abstract": "Simpson's paradox is an obstacle to establishing a probabilistic association\nbetween two events $a_1$ and $a_2$, given the third (lurking) random variable\n$B$. We focus on scenarios when the random variables $A$ (which combines $a_1$,\n$a_2$, and their complements) and $B$ have a common cause $C$ that need not be\nobserved. Alternatively, we can assume that $C$ screens out $A$ from $B$. For\nsuch cases, the correct association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ is to be defined\nvia conditioning over $C$. This setup generalizes the original Simpson's\nparadox: now its two contradicting options refer to two particular and\ndifferent causes $C$. We show that if $B$ and $C$ are binary and $A$ is\nquaternary (the minimal and the most widespread situation for the Simpson's\nparadox), the conditioning over any binary common cause $C$ establishes the\nsame direction of association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ as the conditioning over\n$B$ in the original formulation of the paradox. Thus, for the minimal common\ncause, one should choose the option of Simpson's paradox that assumes\nconditioning over $B$ and not its marginalization. The same conclusion is\nreached when Simpson's paradox is formulated via 3 continuous Gaussian\nvariables: within the minimal formulation of the paradox (3 scalar continuous\nvariables $A_1$, $A_2$, and $B$), one should choose the option with the\nconditioning over $B$.",

Recently, entropy coding has been introduced to further reduce the\ncommunication overhead. The key idea is to train the distributed DNN jointly\nwith an entropy model, which is used as side information during inference time\nto adaptively encode latent representations into bit streams with variable\nlength. To the best of our knowledge, the resilience of entropy models is yet\nto be investigated. As such, in this paper we formulate and investigate the\nresilience of entropy models to intentional interference (e.g., adversarial\nattacks) and unintentional interference (e.g., weather changes and motion\nblur). Through an extensive experimental campaign with 3 different DNN\narchitectures, 2 entropy models and 4 rate-distortion trade-off factors, we\ndemonstrate that the entropy attacks can increase the communication overhead by\nup to 95%. By separating compression features in frequency and spatial domain,\nwe propose a new defense mechanism that can reduce the transmission overhead of\nthe attacked input by about 9% compared to unperturbed data, with only about 2%\naccuracy loss.

    "abstract": "We propose a new attention mechanism with linear complexity, ATP, that\nfixates \\textbf{A}ttention on \\textbf{T}op \\textbf{P}rincipal keys, rather than\non each individual token. Particularly, ATP is driven by an important\nobservation that input sequences are typically low-rank, i.e., input sequences\ncan be represented by a few principal bases. Therefore, instead of directly\niterating over all the input tokens, ATP transforms inputs into an orthogonal\nspace and computes attention only on the top principal bases (keys). Owing to\nthe observed low-rank structure in input sequences, ATP is able to capture\nsemantic relationships in input sequences with a few principal keys.\nFurthermore, the attention complexity is reduced from \\emph{quadratic} to\n\\emph{linear} without incurring a noticeable performance drop. ATP further\nreduces complexity for other linear layers with low-rank inputs, leading to\nmore speedup compared to prior works that solely target the attention module.\nOur evaluations on various models (e.g., BERT and Llama) demonstrate that ATP\nachieves comparable accuracy with much lower computation and memory complexity\nthan the standard attention mechanism. In particular, ATP barely loses accuracy\nwith only $1/2$ principal keys, and only incurs around $2\\%$ accuracy drops\nwith $1/4$ principal keys.",

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance\nacross diverse tasks, recent studies showcase that causal LLMs suffer from the\n\"reversal curse\". It is a typical example that the model knows \"A's father is\nB\", but is unable to reason \"B's child is A\". This limitation poses a challenge\nto the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a\ngap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In\nthis paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root\ncause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the\ntraining and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language\nmodels to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly,\npermutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since\nthis can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous\npermutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing\nchallenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address\nthis issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which\naddresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units\n(i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting\nthese units before feeding into the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SPT effectively mitigates the reversal curse since the performance on\nreversed questions approximates that on the forward ones, and significantly\nadvances the performance of existing works.",

Yet these\nlanguage models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making\ntheir judgments biased in problematic ways about groups like African Americans.\nWhile prior research has focused on overt racism in language models, social\nscientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed\nover time. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language\nmodels. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the\nform of dialect prejudice: we extend research showing that Americans hold\nraciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English and find\nthat language models have the same prejudice, exhibiting covert stereotypes\nthat are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever\nexperimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil\nrights movement. By contrast, the language models' overt stereotypes about\nAfrican Americans are much more positive. We demonstrate that dialect prejudice\nhas the potential for harmful consequences by asking language models to make\nhypothetical decisions about people, based only on how they speak. Language\nmodels are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be\nassigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to\ndeath. Finally, we show that existing methods for alleviating racial bias in\nlanguage models such as human feedback training do not mitigate the dialect\nprejudice, but can exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt\nstereotypes, by teaching language models to superficially conceal the racism\nthat they maintain on a deeper level.

Doctors, for instance, may prescribe treatments by\npredicting the likely outcome of each available treatment. Actions of an expert\nthus naturally encode part of their domain knowledge, and can help make\ninferences within the same domain: Knowing doctors try to prescribe the best\ntreatment for their patients, we can tell treatments prescribed more frequently\nare likely to be more effective.

In this paper, we argue that expertise - particularly the\ntype of expertise the decision-makers of a domain are likely to have - can be\ninformative in designing and selecting methods for treatment effect estimation.\nWe formally define two types of expertise, predictive and prognostic, and\ndemonstrate empirically that: (i) the prominent type of expertise in a domain\nsignificantly influences the performance of different methods in treatment\neffect estimation, and (ii) it is possible to predict the type of expertise\npresent in a dataset, which can provide a quantitative basis for model\nselection.",

The\nsubstantial demand for high-quality human motion data especially in online\nacquirement has led to a surge in human motion research works. Prior works have\nmainly concentrated on dual-modality learning, such as text and motion tasks,\nbut three-modality learning has been rarely explored. Intuitively, an extra\nintroduced modality can enrich a model's application scenario, and more\nimportantly, an adequate choice of the extra modality can also act as an\nintermediary and enhance the alignment between the other two disparate\nmodalities.

Moreover, our approach leverages a specially\ndesigned attention mechanism to foster enhanced alignment and synergistic\neffects among text, video, and motion modalities.

In our quest for effective\nuniformity metrics, we pinpoint four principled properties that such metrics\nshould possess. Namely, an effective uniformity metric should remain invariant\nto instance permutations and sample replications while accurately capturing\nfeature redundancy and dimensional collapse. Surprisingly, we find that the\nuniformity metric proposed by \\citet{Wang2020UnderstandingCR} fails to satisfy\nthe majority of these properties. Specifically, their metric is sensitive to\nsample replications, and can not account for feature redundancy and dimensional\ncollapse correctly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new\nuniformity metric based on the Wasserstein distance, which satisfies all the\naforementioned properties. Integrating this new metric in existing\nself-supervised learning methods effectively mitigates dimensional collapse and\nconsistently improves their performance on downstream tasks involving CIFAR-10\nand CIFAR-100 datasets.

Subsequently, we manually modify the contents that do\nnot adhere to human language conventions and then have LLMs re-generate,\nsimulating authentic human-machine interaction scenarios. Finally, professional\nscholars annotate all the samples in the dataset. DiaHalu covers four common\nmulti-turn dialogue domains and five hallucination subtypes, extended from\nfactuality and faithfulness hallucination. Experiments through some well-known\nLLMs and detection methods on the dataset show that DiaHalu is a challenging\nbenchmark, holding significant value for further research.",

We introduce the Spatial Relation for\nGeneration (SR4G) dataset, which contains 9.9 millions image-caption pairs for\ntraining, and more than 60 thousand captions for evaluation. In order to test\ngeneralization we also provide an 'unseen' split, where the set of objects in\nthe train and test captions are disjoint. SR4G is the first dataset that can be\nused to spatially fine-tune text-to-image systems. We show that fine-tuning two\ndifferent Stable Diffusion models (denoted as SD$_{SR4G}$) yields up to 9\npoints improvements in the VISOR metric. The improvement holds in the 'unseen'\nsplit, showing that SD$_{SR4G}$ is able to generalize to unseen objects.\nSD$_{SR4G}$ improves the state-of-the-art with fewer parameters, and avoids\ncomplex architectures. Our analysis shows that improvement is consistent for\nall relations. The dataset and the code will be publicly available.",

CDFSL faces challenges in\ntransferring knowledge across dissimilar domains and fine-tuning models with\nlimited training data. To address these challenges, we initially extend the\nanalysis of loss landscapes from the parameter space to the representation\nspace, which allows us to simultaneously interpret the transferring and\nfine-tuning difficulties of CDFSL models. We observe that sharp minima in the\nloss landscapes of the representation space result in representations that are\nhard to transfer and fine-tune. Moreover, existing flatness-based methods have\nlimited generalization ability due to their short-range flatness. To enhance\nthe transferability and facilitate fine-tuning, we introduce a simple yet\neffective approach to achieve long-range flattening of the minima in the loss\nlandscape. This approach considers representations that are differently\nnormalized as minima in the loss landscape and flattens the high-loss region in\nthe middle by randomly sampling interpolated representations. We implement this\nmethod as a new normalization layer that replaces the original one in both CNNs\nand ViTs. This layer is simple and lightweight, introducing only a minimal\nnumber of additional parameters.

Knowing the type of unmanned aerial vehicle can go\na long way in determining any potential risks it carries. For instance,\nfixed-wing craft can carry more weight over longer distances, thus potentially\nposing a more significant threat. This paper presents a machine learning model\nfor classifying unmanned aerial vehicles as quadrotor, hexarotor, or\nfixed-wing. Our approach effectively applies a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network for the purpose of time series classification. We performed\nexperiments to test the effects of changing the timestamp sampling method and\naddressing the imbalance in the class distribution. Through these experiments,\nwe identified the top-performing sampling and class imbalance fixing methods.\nAveraging the macro f-scores across 10 folds of data, we found that the\nmajority quadrotor class was predicted well (98.16%), and, despite an extreme\nclass imbalance, the model could also predicted a majority of fixed-wing\nflights correctly (73.15%). Hexarotor instances were often misclassified as\nquadrotors due to the similarity of multirotors in general (42.15%). However,\nresults remained relatively stable across certain methods, which prompted us to\nanalyze and report on their tradeoffs.

Numerous datasets have been constructed for various IE tasks,\nleading to time-consuming and labor-intensive data annotations. Nevertheless,\nmost prevailing methods focus on training task-specific models, while the\ncommon knowledge among different IE tasks is not explicitly modeled. Moreover,\nthe same phrase may have inconsistent labels in different tasks, which poses a\nbig challenge for knowledge transfer using a unified model. In this study, we\npropose a regularization-based transfer learning method for IE (TIE) via an\ninstructed graph decoder. Specifically, we first construct an instruction pool\nfor datasets from all well-known IE tasks, and then present an instructed graph\ndecoder, which decodes various complex structures into a graph uniformly based\non corresponding instructions. In this way, the common knowledge shared with\nexisting datasets can be learned and transferred to a new dataset with new\nlabels. Furthermore, to alleviate the label inconsistency problem among various\nIE tasks, we introduce a task-specific regularization strategy, which does not\nupdate the gradients of two tasks with 'opposite direction'. We conduct\nextensive experiments on 12 datasets spanning four IE tasks, and the results\ndemonstrate the great advantages of our proposed method",

Such models are characterized\nby complex dynamics between neurons and spikes. These are very sensitive to the\nhyperparameters, making their optimization challenging. To tackle\nhyperparameter optimization of SNNs, we initially extended the signal loss\nissue of SNNs to what we call silent networks. These networks fail to emit\nenough spikes at their outputs due to mistuned hyperparameters or architecture.\nGenerally, search spaces are heavily restrained, sometimes even discretized, to\nprevent the sampling of such networks. By defining an early stopping criterion\ndetecting silent networks and by designing specific constraints, we were able\nto instantiate larger and more flexible search spaces. We applied a constrained\nBayesian optimization technique, which was asynchronously parallelized, as the\nevaluation time of a SNN is highly stochastic. Large-scale experiments were\ncarried-out on a multi-GPU Petascale architecture. By leveraging silent\nnetworks, results show an acceleration of the search, while maintaining good\nperformances of both the optimization algorithm and the best solution obtained.\nWe were able to apply our methodology to two popular training algorithms, known\nas spike timing dependent plasticity and surrogate gradient. Early detection\nallowed us to prevent worthless and costly computation, directing the search\ntoward promising hyperparameter combinations. Our methodology could be applied\nto multi-objective problems, where the spiking activity is often minimized to\nreduce the energy consumption.

However, these models also display significant limitations when\napplied to downstream tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a\nresult of ``decision shortcuts'' that hinder their generalization capabilities.\nIn this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features,\nencompassing both \\textit{desired invariant causal features} and\n\\textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP\non downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize\npre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements.

While deep learning approaches have demonstrated their great potential\nin this area, it still remains unsolved to establish a connection between\nmultiple driving scenes (e.g., merging, roundabout, intersection) and the\ndesign of deep learning models. Current learning-based methods typically use\none unified model to predict trajectories in different scenarios, which may\nresult in sub-optimal results for one individual scene. To address this issue,\nwe propose Multi-Scenes Network (aka. MS-Net), which is a multi-path sparse\nmodel trained by an evolutionary process. MS-Net selectively activates a subset\nof its parameters during the inference stage to produce prediction results for\neach scene. In the training stage, the motion prediction task under\ndifferentiated scenes is abstracted as a multi-task learning problem, an\nevolutionary algorithm is designed to encourage the network search of the\noptimal parameters for each scene while sharing common knowledge between\ndifferent scenes. Our experiment results show that with substantially reduced\nparameters, MS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on\nwell-established pedestrian motion prediction datasets, e.g., ETH and UCY, and\nranks the 2nd place on the INTERACTION challenge.",

This paper introduces DFIN (Decomposed\nFocused-In-Context), an innovative extension of DIN-SQL that enhances\nText-to-SQL conversion by addressing schema linking errors, which are a major\nsource of inaccuracies. DFIN uniquely alternates between prompting techniques\nand Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), adapting to the size and complexity\nof the database schema. A preprocessing phase embeds database definitions and\nleverages annotated files, akin to those in the BIRD dataset, facilitating the\nruntime retrieval of pertinent schema information. This strategy significantly\nreduces the token count for schema linking prompts, enabling the use of a\nstandard GPT-4 model over its larger context variant, thus handling large-scale\ndatabases more effectively and economically. Our evaluation on the BIRD\ndataset, a challenging real-world benchmark, demonstrates that DFIN not only\nscales efficiently but also improves accuracy, achieving a score of 51.69. This\nimprovement surpasses DIN-SQL method (the current third-place), which is the\nhighest-ranked model employing in-context learning rather than fine-tuning,\npreviously scoring 50.72.

The method employs orthogonal\nregression with feature weighting to retain sufficient statistical and\nstructural information related to local label correlations of the multi-label\ndata in the feature learning process. Additionally, both global feature\nredundancy and global label relevancy information have been considered in the\northogonal regression model, which could contribute to the search for\ndiscriminative and non-redundant feature subsets in the multi-label data. The\ncost function of GRROOR is an unbalanced orthogonal Procrustes problem on the\nStiefel manifold. A simple yet effective scheme is utilized to obtain an\noptimal solution.

We exploit\nlanguage's inherent correlations and predictability to constrain transmission\ncosts by allowing the destination to predict or complete words with potential\ndissimilarity with the source text. Concretely, our objective is to obtain\nachievable $(\\bar{c}, \\bar{s})$ pairs, where $\\bar{c}$ is the average\ntransmission cost at the source and $\\bar{s}$ is the average semantic\nsimilarity measured via cosine similarity between vector embedding of words at\nthe source and those predicted/completed at the destination. We obtain\n$(\\bar{c}, \\bar{s})$ pairs for neural language and first-order Markov\nchain-based small language models (SLM) for prediction, using both a threshold\npolicy that transmits a word if its cosine similarity with that\npredicted/completed at the destination is below a threshold, and a periodic\npolicy, which transmits words after a specific interval and predicts/completes\nthe words in between, at the destination. We adopt an SLM for word completion.\nWe demonstrate that, when communication occurs over a noiseless channel, the\nthreshold policy achieves a higher $\\bar{s}$ for a given $\\bar{c}$ than the\nperiodic policy and that the $\\bar{s}$ achieved with the neural SLM is greater\nthan or equal to that of the Markov chain-based algorithm for the same\n$\\bar{c}$. The improved performance comes with a higher complexity in terms of\ntime and computing requirements. However, when communication occurs over a\ncharacter-erasure channel, all prediction algorithms and scheduling policies\nperform poorly. Furthermore, if character-level Huffman coding is used, the\nrequired $\\bar{c}$ to achieve a given $\\bar{s}$ is reduced, but the above\nobservations still apply.",

Our survey offers a comprehensive review of route\nrecommendation work based on urban computing. It is organized by the following\nthree parts: 1) Methodology-wise. We categorize a large volume of traditional\nmachine learning and modern deep learning methods. Also, we discuss their\nhistorical relations and reveal the edge-cutting progress. 2)\nApplication\\-wise. We present numerous novel applications related to route\ncommendation within urban computing scenarios. 3) We discuss current problems\nand challenges and envision several promising research directions. We believe\nthat this survey can help relevant researchers quickly familiarize themselves\nwith the current state of route recommendation research and then direct them to\nfuture research trends.",

    "abstract": "We introduce SoftTiger, a clinical large language model (CLaM) designed as a\nfoundation model for healthcare workflows. The narrative and unstructured\nnature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization.\nWe address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data,\naccording to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate\ndata for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical\nimpression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a\nstate-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training\nis orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical\ntasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and\nthen learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we\naddress several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long\ncontext window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms\nother popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a\nmild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards\nhealthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release\nSoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as\ndatasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a\nsignificant contribution to the healthcare industry.",

    "abstract": "In contemporary rural healthcare settings, the principal challenge in\ndiagnosing brain images is the scarcity of available data, given that most of\nthe existing deep learning models demand extensive training data to optimize\ntheir performance, necessitating centralized processing methods that\npotentially compromise data privacy. This paper proposes a novel framework\ntailored for brain tissue segmentation in rural healthcare facilities. The\nframework employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment in tandem\nwith a refinement model (RM) deployed locally at rural healthcare sites. The\nproposed DRL model has a reduced parameter count and practicality for\nimplementation across distributed rural sites. To uphold data privacy and\nenhance model generalization without transgressing privacy constraints, we\nemploy federated learning (FL) for cooperative model training. We demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach by training the network with a limited data set\nand observing a substantial performance enhancement, mitigating inaccuracies\nand irregularities in segmentation across diverse sites. Remarkably, the DRL\nmodel attains an accuracy of up to 80%, surpassing the capabilities of\nconventional convolutional neural networks when confronted with data\ninsufficiency. Incorporating our RM results in an additional accuracy\nimprovement of at least 10%, while FL contributes to a further accuracy\nenhancement of up to 5%. Collectively, the framework achieves an average 92%\naccuracy rate within rural healthcare settings characterized by data\nconstraints.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a prominent generative AI tool,\nwhere the user enters a query and the LLM generates an answer. To reduce harm\nand misuse, efforts have been made to align these LLMs to human values using\nadvanced training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(RLHF). However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to\nadversarial jailbreak attempts aiming at subverting the embedded safety\nguardrails. To address this challenge, this paper defines and investigates the\nRefusal Loss of LLMs and then proposes a method called Gradient Cuff to detect\njailbreak attempts. Gradient Cuff exploits the unique properties observed in\nthe refusal loss landscape, including functional values and its smoothness, to\ndesign an effective two-step detection strategy. Experimental results on two\naligned LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and Vicuna-7B-V1.5) and six types of jailbreak\nattacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP, Base64, and LRL) show that Gradient Cuff can\nsignificantly improve the LLM's rejection capability for malicious jailbreak\nqueries, while maintaining the model's performance for benign user queries by\nadjusting the detection threshold.",

    "abstract": "In the long-tailed recognition field, the Decoupled Training paradigm has\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities among various methods. This paradigm\ndecouples the training process into separate representation learning and\nclassifier re-training. Previous works have attempted to improve both stages\nsimultaneously, making it difficult to isolate the effect of classifier\nre-training. Furthermore, recent empirical studies have demonstrated that\nsimple regularization can yield strong feature representations, emphasizing the\nneed to reassess existing classifier re-training methods. In this study, we\nrevisit classifier re-training methods based on a unified feature\nrepresentation and re-evaluate their performances. We propose a new metric\ncalled Logits Magnitude as a superior measure of model performance, replacing\nthe commonly used Weight Norm. However, since it is hard to directly optimize\nthe new metric during training, we introduce a suitable approximate invariant\ncalled Regularized Standard Deviation. Based on the two newly proposed metrics,\nwe prove that reducing the absolute value of Logits Magnitude when it is nearly\nbalanced can effectively decrease errors and disturbances during training,\nleading to better model performance. Motivated by these findings, we develop a\nsimple logits retargeting approach (LORT) without the requirement of prior\nknowledge of the number of samples per class. LORT divides the original one-hot\nlabel into small true label probabilities and large negative label\nprobabilities distributed across each class. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on various imbalanced datasets, including\nCIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.",

    "abstract": "Skill-based reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown considerable\npromise, especially in solving long-horizon tasks via hierarchical structures.\nThese skills, learned task-agnostically from offline datasets, can accelerate\nthe policy learning process for new tasks. Yet, the application of these skills\nin different domains remains restricted due to their inherent dependency on the\ndatasets, which poses a challenge when attempting to learn a skill-based policy\nvia RL for a target domain different from the datasets' domains. In this paper,\nwe present a novel offline skill learning framework DuSkill which employs a\nguided Diffusion model to generate versatile skills extended from the limited\nskills in datasets, thereby enhancing the robustness of policy learning for\ntasks in different domains. Specifically, we devise a guided diffusion-based\nskill decoder in conjunction with the hierarchical encoding to disentangle the\nskill embedding space into two distinct representations, one for encapsulating\ndomain-invariant behaviors and the other for delineating the factors that\ninduce domain variations in the behaviors. Our DuSkill framework enhances the\ndiversity of skills learned offline, thus enabling to accelerate the learning\nprocedure of high-level policies for different domains. Through experiments, we\nshow that DuSkill outperforms other skill-based imitation learning and RL\nalgorithms for several long-horizon tasks, demonstrating its benefits in\nfew-shot imitation and online RL.",

In this context,\naccessible and effective risk assessment is indispensable. Traditional\napproaches rely on resource-intensive diagnostic tests, typically administered\nafter the onset of symptoms. The widespread availability of electrocardiogram\n(ECG) technology and the power of Machine Learning are emerging as viable\nalternatives within smart healthcare. In this paper, we propose several\nmulti-modal approaches that combine 30-second ECG recordings and approximate\nlong-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data to estimate the risk of HF\nhospitalization. We introduce two survival models: an XGBoost model with\nAccelerated Failure Time (AFT) incorporating comprehensive ECG features and a\nResNet model that learns from the raw ECG. We extend these with our novel\nlong-term HRVs extracted from the combination of ultra-short-term beat-to-beat\nmeasurements taken over the day. To capture their temporal dynamics, we propose\na survival model comprising ResNet and Transformer architectures (TFM-ResNet).\nOur experiments demonstrate high model performance for HF risk assessment with\na concordance index of 0.8537 compared to 14 survival models and competitive\ndiscrimination power on various external ECG datasets.

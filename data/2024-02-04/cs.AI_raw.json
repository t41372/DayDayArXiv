    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques for optimizing data management problems have\nbeen extensively studied and widely deployed in recent five years. However\ntraditional ML methods have limitations on generalizability (adapting to\ndifferent scenarios) and inference ability (understanding the context).\nFortunately, large language models (LLMs) have shown high generalizability and\nhuman-competitive abilities in understanding context, which are promising for\ndata management tasks (e.g., database diagnosis, database tuning). However,\nexisting LLMs have several limitations: hallucination, high cost, and low\naccuracy for complicated tasks. To address these challenges, we design LLMDB,\nan LLM-enhanced data management paradigm which has generalizability and high\ninference ability while avoiding hallucination, reducing LLM cost, and\nachieving high accuracy. LLMDB embeds domain-specific knowledge to avoid\nhallucination by LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering. LLMDB reduces the high\ncost of LLMs by vector databases which provide semantic search and caching\nabilities. LLMDB improves the task accuracy by LLM agent which provides\nmultiple-round inference and pipeline executions. We showcase three real-world\nscenarios that LLMDB can well support, including query rewrite, database\ndiagnosis and data analytics. We also summarize the open research challenges of\nLLMDB.",

By contrast, systems such as causal models, that learn abstract\nvariables and causal relationships, can demonstrate increased robustness\nagainst changes in the distribution. One reason for this success is the\nexistence and use of Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICMs) representing\nhigh-level concepts that only sparsely interact. In this work, we apply two\nconcepts from causality to learn ICMs within LLMs. We develop a new LLM\narchitecture composed of multiple sparsely interacting language modelling\nmodules. We show that such causal constraints can improve out-of-distribution\nperformance on abstract and causal reasoning tasks.

In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset\nUniTSyn, which is capable of enhancing the prowess of LLMs for Unit Test\nSynthesis. Associating tests with the tested functions is crucial for LLMs to\ninfer the expected behavior and the logic paths to be verified. By leveraging\nLanguage Server Protocol, UniTSyn achieves the challenging goal of collecting\nfocal-test pairs without per-project execution setups or per-language\nheuristics that tend to be fragile and difficult to scale. It contains 2.7\nmillion focal-test pairs across five mainstream programming languages, making\nit possible to be utilized for enhancing the test generation ability of LLMs.\nThe details of UniTSyn can be found in Table 1.

Multiobjective Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques solve\nthis problem by determining a Pareto optimal parameter set for an MPC with\nstatic weights. However, a single parameter set may not deliver the most\noptimal closed-loop control performance when the context of the MPC operating\nconditions changes during its operation, urging the need to adapt the cost\nfunction weights at runtime. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms can\nautomatically learn context-dependent optimal parameter sets and dynamically\nadapt for a Weightsvarying MPC (WMPC). However, learning cost function weights\nfrom scratch in a continuous action space may lead to unsafe operating states.\nTo solve this, we propose a novel approach limiting the RL actions within a\nsafe learning space representing a catalog of pre-optimized BO Pareto-optimal\nweight sets. We conceive a RL agent not to learn in a continuous space but to\nproactively anticipate upcoming control tasks and to choose the most optimal\ndiscrete actions, each corresponding to a single set of Pareto optimal weights,\ncontext-dependent.

Assessing the competencies of tutors accurately\nand efficiently can drive the development of tailored tutor training programs.\nHowever, evaluating novice tutor ability during real-time tutoring remains\nchallenging as it typically requires experts-in-the-loop.

The local\nsub-graphs encode local volumetric gain locations as frontiers, based on the\ndirect pointcloud visibility, allowing fast graph building and path planning.\nAdditionally, the global graph is build in an efficient way, using node-edge\ninformation exchange only on overlapping regions of sequential sub-graphs.\nDifferent from the state-of-the-art graph based exploration methods, the\nproposed approach efficiently re-uses sub-graphs built in previous iterations\nto construct the global navigation layer. Another merit of the proposed scheme\nis the ability to handle scene changes (e.g. blocked pathways), adaptively\nupdating the obstructed part of the global graph from traversable to\nnot-traversable.

Pre-neural dependency parsers for MRLs subscribed to the joint\nmorpho-syntactic hypothesis, stating that morphological segmentation and\nsyntactic parsing should be solved jointly, rather than as a pipeline where\nsegmentation precedes parsing.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a\nwide range of tasks, but the associated expensive API cost greatly limits the\nreal application. Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and\ntree-of-thoughts (ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but\noverlook the rapidly increasing API cost, which could be particularly\nproblematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces.\nMotivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose \"Synergy of\nThoughts\"(SoT) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs with\ndifferent scales for efficient reasoning. By default, SoT uses smaller-scale\nlanguage models to generate multiple low-cost intuitive thoughts, which\nresembles the parallel intuitions produced by System 1. We then design a\nconfidence evaluator where the intuitive thoughts are cross-evaluated and\nintroduce a controllable threshold mechanism to decide their mutual conflict.\nIf these intuitive thoughts exhibit conflicts, SoT will invoke the reflective\nreasoning of scaled-up language models to emulate the intervention of System 2,\nwhich will override the intuitive thoughts and rectify the reasoning results.\nThis framework is model-agnostic and training-free, which can be flexibly\nimplemented with various off-the-shelf LLMs. Experiments on six representative\nreasoning tasks show that SoT substantially reduces the API cost by\n38.3%-75.1%, and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy\nand solution diversity. Notably, the average token cost reduction on open-ended\ntasks reaches up to 69.1%.",

Additionally, they are energy-intensive, leading to\nlimited battery lifespan. We present PixelGen, which re-imagines embedded\ncamera systems. Specifically, PixelGen combines sensors, transceivers, and\nlow-resolution image and infrared vision sensors to capture a broader world\nrepresentation. They are deliberately chosen for their simplicity, low bitrate,\nand power consumption, culminating in an energy-efficient platform. We show\nthat despite the simplicity, the captured data can be processed using\ntransformer-based image and language models to generate novel representations\nof the environment. For example, we demonstrate that it can allow the\ngeneration of high-definition images, while the camera utilises low-power,\nlow-resolution monochrome cameras. Furthermore, the capabilities of PixelGen\nextend beyond traditional photography, enabling visualization of phenomena\ninvisible to conventional cameras, such as sound waves. PixelGen can enable\nnumerous novel applications, and we demonstrate that it enables unique\nvisualization of the surroundings that are then projected on extended reality\nheadsets. We believe, PixelGen goes beyond conventional cameras and opens new\navenues for research and photography.",

    "abstract": "In robot learning, the observation space is crucial due to the distinct\ncharacteristics of different modalities, which can potentially become a\nbottleneck alongside policy design. In this study, we explore the influence of\nvarious observation spaces on robot learning, focusing on three predominant\nmodalities: RGB, RGB-D, and point cloud. We introduce OBSBench, a benchmark\ncomprising two simulators and 125 tasks, along with standardized pipelines for\nvarious encoders and policy baselines. Extensive experiments on diverse\ncontact-rich manipulation tasks reveal a notable trend: point cloud-based\nmethods, even those with the simplest designs, frequently outperform their RGB\nand RGB-D counterparts. This trend persists in both scenarios: training from\nscratch and utilizing pre-training. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that\npoint cloud observations often yield better policy performance and\nsignificantly stronger generalization capabilities across various geometric and\nvisual conditions. These outcomes suggest that the 3D point cloud is a valuable\nobservation modality for intricate robotic tasks. We also suggest that\nincorporating both appearance and coordinate information can enhance the\nperformance of point cloud methods. We hope our work provides valuable insights\nand guidance for designing more generalizable and robust robotic models. Codes\nare available at https://github.com/HaoyiZhu/PointCloudMatters.",

    "abstract": "Fast adapting to unknown peers (partners or opponents) with different\nstrategies is a key challenge in multi-agent games. To do so, it is crucial for\nthe agent to probe and identify the peer's strategy efficiently, as this is the\nprerequisite for carrying out the best response in adaptation. However,\nexploring the strategies of unknown peers is difficult, especially when the\ngames are partially observable and have a long horizon. In this paper, we\npropose a peer identification reward, which rewards the learning agent based on\nhow well it can identify the behavior pattern of the peer over the historical\ncontext, such as the observation over multiple episodes. This reward motivates\nthe agent to learn a context-aware policy for effective exploration and fast\nadaptation, i.e., to actively seek and collect informative feedback from peers\nwhen uncertain about their policies and to exploit the context to perform the\nbest response when confident. We evaluate our method on diverse testbeds that\ninvolve competitive (Kuhn Poker), cooperative (PO-Overcooked), or mixed\n(Predator-Prey-W) games with peer agents. We demonstrate that our method\ninduces more active exploration behavior, achieving faster adaptation and\nbetter outcomes than existing methods.",

For example, there are dozens of systems running on\nsmartphones, each with more than millions of downloadable applications. Sifting\nthrough this large amount of data and making sense requires new techniques,\nsuch as from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). To apply these\ntechniques successfully in CF, we need to justify and explain the results to\nthe stakeholders of CF, such as forensic analysts and members of the court, for\nthem to make an informed decision. If we want to apply AI successfully in CF,\nthere is a need to develop trust in AI systems. Some other factors in accepting\nthe use of AI in CF are to make AI authentic, interpretable, understandable,\nand interactive. This way, AI systems will be more acceptable to the public and\nensure alignment with legal standards. An explainable AI (XAI) system can play\nthis role in CF, and we call such a system XAI-CF. XAI-CF is indispensable and\nis still in its infancy. In this paper, we explore and make a case for the\nsignificance and advantages of XAI-CF. We strongly emphasize the need to build\na successful and practical XAI-CF system and discuss some of the main\nrequirements and prerequisites of such a system.

Even high\nquality discovery becomes futile when delivery fails. Many sophisticated\nalgorithms exist for discovering behavioral segments; however, these ignore the\ndelivery component. The problem is compounded because (i) the discovery is\nperformed on the behavior data space in firms' data (e.g., user clicks), while\nthe delivery is predicated on the static data space (e.g., geo, age) as defined\nby media; and (ii) firms work under budget constraint. We introduce a\nstochastic optimization based algorithm for delivery optimized discovery of\nbehavioral user segmentation and offer new metrics to address the joint\noptimization. We leverage optimization under a budget constraint for delivery\ncombined with a learning-based component for discovery.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has received significant\nattention for performing tasks without the need for costly manual reward design\nby aligning human preferences. It is crucial to consider diverse human feedback\ntypes and various learning methods in different environments. However,\nquantifying progress in RLHF with diverse feedback is challenging due to the\nlack of standardized annotation platforms and widely used unified benchmarks.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-RLHF, a comprehensive system\nimplementation tailored for RLHF. It aims to provide a complete workflow from\nreal human feedback, fostering progress in the development of practical\nproblems. Uni-RLHF contains three packages: 1) a universal multi-feedback\nannotation platform, 2) large-scale crowdsourced feedback datasets, and 3)\nmodular offline RLHF baseline implementations. Uni-RLHF develops a\nuser-friendly annotation interface tailored to various feedback types,\ncompatible with a wide range of mainstream RL environments. We then establish a\nsystematic pipeline of crowdsourced annotations, resulting in large-scale\nannotated datasets comprising more than 15 million steps across 30+ popular\ntasks. Through extensive experiments, the results in the collected datasets\ndemonstrate competitive performance compared to those from well-designed manual\nrewards. We evaluate various design choices and offer insights into their\nstrengths and potential areas of improvement. We wish to build valuable\nopen-source platforms, datasets, and baselines to facilitate the development of\nmore robust and reliable RLHF solutions based on realistic human feedback.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and ever-evolving\npractical requirements, finding an efficient and effective alignment method has\nnever been more critical. However, the tension between the complexity of\ncurrent alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment\nscenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach\nthat can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce Aligner,\na novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals\nbetween preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a\nmodel-agnostic, plug-and-play module, Aligner can be directly applied to\nvarious open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it\nsuitable for rapid iteration. Notably, Aligner can be applied to any powerful,\nlarge-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the\nupstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data,\nbreaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate\nperformance improvements by deploying the same Aligner model across 11\ndifferent LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and\nhonesty). Specifically, Aligner-7B has achieved an average improvement of 68.9%\nin helpfulness and 23.8% in harmlessness across the tested LLMs while also\neffectively reducing hallucination. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking\nAligner-2B on GPT-4 Turbo improved its LC Win Rate from 55.0% to 58.3%,\nsurpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5% Win Rate (community report).",

CoRaiS\nembeds the real-time states of multi-edge system and requests information, and\ncombines the embeddings with a policy network to schedule the requests, so that\nthe response time of all requests can be minimized. Evaluation results verify\nthat CoRaiS can make a high-quality scheduling decision in real time, and can\nbe generalized to other multi-edge computing system, regardless of system\nscales. Characteristic validation also demonstrates that CoRaiS successfully\nlearns to balance loads, perceive real-time state and recognize heterogeneity\nwhile scheduling.",

This has been particularly advantageous in fields like\nmedical image analysis, where labeled data are scarce. Although effective for\nclassification tasks, this methodology has shown limitations in more complex\napplications, such as medical image segmentation. In this paper, we introduce\nMedical imaging Enhanced with Dynamic Self-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation\n(MedSASS), a dedicated self-supervised framework tailored for medical image\nsegmentation. We evaluate MedSASS against existing state-of-the-art methods\nacross four diverse medical datasets, showcasing its superiority. MedSASS\noutperforms existing CNN-based self-supervised methods by 3.83% and matches the\nperformance of ViT-based methods. Furthermore, when MedSASS is trained\nend-to-end, covering both encoder and decoder, it demonstrates significant\nimprovements of 14.4% for CNNs and 6% for ViT-based architectures compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art self-supervised strategies.",

Over the course of training, complex\ncomputational structures form and re-form inside the neural network, leading to\nshifts in input/output behavior. It is a priority for the science of deep\nlearning to uncover principles governing the development of neural network\nstructure and behavior. Drawing on the framework of singular learning theory,\nwe propose that model development is deeply linked to degeneracy in the local\ngeometry of the loss landscape. We investigate this link by monitoring loss\nlandscape degeneracy throughout training, as quantified by the local learning\ncoefficient, for a transformer language model and an in-context linear\nregression transformer. We show that training can be divided into distinct\nperiods of change in loss landscape degeneracy, and that these changes in\ndegeneracy coincide with significant changes in the internal computational\nstructure and the input/output behavior of the transformers. This finding\nunderscores the potential of a degeneracy-based perspective for understanding\nmodern deep learning.",

    "abstract": "Although data-driven methods have achieved success in 3D human pose\nestimation, they often suffer from domain gaps and exhibit limited\ngeneralization. In contrast, optimization-based methods excel in fine-tuning\nfor specific cases but are generally inferior to data-driven methods in overall\nperformance. We observe that previous optimization-based methods commonly rely\non projection constraint, which only ensures alignment in 2D space, potentially\nleading to the overfitting problem. To address this, we propose an\nUncertainty-Aware testing-time Optimization (UAO) framework, which keeps the\nprior information of pre-trained model and alleviates the overfitting problem\nusing the uncertainty of joints. Specifically, during the training phase, we\ndesign an effective 2D-to-3D network for estimating the corresponding 3D pose\nwhile quantifying the uncertainty of each 3D joint. For optimization during\ntesting, the proposed optimization framework freezes the pre-trained model and\noptimizes only a latent state. Projection loss is then employed to ensure the\ngenerated poses are well aligned in 2D space for high-quality optimization.\nFurthermore, we utilize the uncertainty of each joint to determine how much\neach joint is allowed for optimization. The effectiveness and superiority of\nthe proposed framework are validated through extensive experiments on two\nchallenging datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Notably, our approach\noutperforms the previous best result by a large margin of 4.5% on Human3.6M.\nOur source code will be open-sourced.",

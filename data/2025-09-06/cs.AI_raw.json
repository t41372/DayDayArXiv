    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy; contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.",

We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL) setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains, broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.",

    "abstract": "While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic \"what-if\" analysis for strategic stress-testing.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver. Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.",

    "abstract": "Automated visual inspection in medical-device manufacturing faces unique challenges, including extremely low defect rates, limited annotated data, hardware restrictions on production lines, and the need for validated, explainable artificial-intelligence systems. This paper presents two attention-guided autoencoder architectures that address these constraints through complementary anomaly-detection strategies. The first employs a multi-scale structural-similarity (4-MS-SSIM) index for inline inspection, enabling interpretable, real-time defect detection on constrained hardware. The second applies a Mahalanobis-distance analysis of randomly reduced latent features for efficient feature-space monitoring and lifecycle verification. Both approaches share a lightweight backbone optimised for high-resolution imagery for typical manufacturing conditions. Evaluations on the Surface Seal Image (SSI) dataset-representing sterile-barrier packaging inspection-demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform reference baselines, including MOCCA, CPCAE, and RAG-PaDiM, under realistic industrial constraints. Cross-domain validation on the MVTec-Zipper benchmark confirms comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art anomaly-detection methods. The dual-mode framework integrates inline anomaly detection and supervisory monitoring, advancing explainable AI architectures toward greater reliability, observability, and lifecycle monitoring in safety-critical manufacturing environments. To facilitate reproducibility, the source code developed for the experiments has been released in the project repository, while the datasets were obtained from publicly available sources.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework. This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast convergence to the true performance.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar challenges.",

Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness through personalized intervention strategies.",

Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding, text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area. Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures, hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs (HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4) hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications and outline future research directions.

    "abstract": "Coding agents powered by large language models are becoming central modules of modern IDEs, helping users perform complex tasks by invoking tools. While powerful, tool invocation opens a substantial attack surface. Prior work has demonstrated attacks against general-purpose and domain-specific agents, but none have focused on the security risks of tool invocation in coding agents. To fill this gap, we conduct the first systematic red-teaming of six popular real-world coding agents: Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, and Trae. Our red-teaming proceeds in two phases. In Phase 1, we perform prompt leakage reconnaissance to recover system prompts. We discover a general vulnerability, ToolLeak, which allows malicious prompt exfiltration through benign argument retrieval during tool invocation. In Phase 2, we hijack the agent's tool-invocation behavior using a novel two-channel prompt injection in the tool description and return values, achieving remote code execution (RCE). We adaptively construct payloads using security information leaked in Phase 1. In emulation across five backends, our method outperforms baselines on Claude-Sonnet-4, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Grok-4, and GPT-5. On real agents, our approach succeeds on 19 of 25 agent-LLM pairs, achieving leakage on every agent using Claude and Grok backends. For tool-invocation hijacking, we obtain RCE on every tested agent-LLM pair, with our two-channel method delivering the highest success rate. We provide case studies on Cursor and Claude Code, analyze security guardrails of external and built-in tools, and conclude with practical defense recommendations.",

    "abstract": "The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis, including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and traceability.",

The prominent challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content, particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object. \\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured. InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs. Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial expressions.

More recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.\n  Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons, reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes. Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer generation.",

    "abstract": "Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents, offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on expert data alone.",

First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning. This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.",

We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fréchet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains modular modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.",

Physical neural networks try to exploit physical systems to perform machine learning more efficiently. In particular, optical systems can calculate with light using negligible energy. While their computational capabilities were long limited by the linearity of optical materials, nonlinear computations have recently been demonstrated through modified input encoding. Despite this breakthrough, our inability to determine if physical neural networks can learn arbitrary relationships between data -- a key requirement for deep learning known as universality -- hinders further progress. Here we present a fundamental theorem that establishes a universality condition for physical neural networks. It provides a powerful mathematical criterion that imposes device constraints, detailing how inputs should be encoded in the tunable parameters of the physical system. Based on this result, we propose a scalable architecture using free-space optics that is provably universal and achieves high accuracy on image classification tasks. Further, by combining the theorem with temporal multiplexing, we present a route to potentially huge effective system sizes in highly practical but poorly scalable on-chip photonic devices. Our theorem and scaling methods apply beyond optical systems and inform the design of a wide class of universal, energy-efficient physical neural networks, justifying further efforts in their development.",

As a result, it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share grew by 2\\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market share grew by 20\\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances. Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.",

To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.",

    "abstract": "Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed in this study.",

To address these challenges, we introduce SEASONED, an effective, self-explanatory, and robust framework for AEC detection.\n  SEASONED extracts semantic information from contract bytecode to construct a semantic relation graph (SRG), and employs a self-counterfactual explainable detector (SCFED) to classify SRGs and generate explanations that highlight the core attack logic. SCFED further enhances robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency by extracting representative information from these explanations. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEASONED, which showcases outstanding detection performance, robustness, generalizability, and data efficiency learning ability.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models, supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy, to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches, geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD applications.",

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.",

Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency.

Our curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs, encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search.

However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.",

BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94, significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline, while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency. Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by up to 48.1%.",

    "abstract": "Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs, respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe. In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised and unsupervised manners.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository, we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe deployment in diverse global contexts.",

    "abstract": "In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.",

This paper presents an in-depth case study of EchoLeak (CVE-2025-32711), a zero-click prompt injection vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot that enabled remote, unauthenticated data exfiltration via a single crafted email. By chaining multiple bypasses-evading Microsofts XPIA (Cross Prompt Injection Attempt) classifier, circumventing link redaction with reference-style Markdown, exploiting auto-fetched images, and abusing a Microsoft Teams proxy allowed by the content security policy-EchoLeak achieved full privilege escalation across LLM trust boundaries without user interaction. We analyze why existing defenses failed, and outline a set of engineering mitigations including prompt partitioning, enhanced input/output filtering, provenance-based access control, and strict content security policies. Beyond the specific exploit, we derive generalizable lessons for building secure AI copilots, emphasizing the principle of least privilege, defense-in-depth architectures, and continuous adversarial testing. Our findings establish prompt injection as a practical, high-severity vulnerability class in production AI systems and provide a blueprint for defending against future AI-native threats.",

To address these challenges, we apply Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints. These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic appeal with functional performance, suggesting that learning-based methods can effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs, OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks, offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue, they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples. This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for developing more capable AI systems.",

Unlike traditional transformer approaches that rely on attention mechanisms, TreeGPT employs bidirectional TreeFFN components that process sequences through adjacent connections in parallel, aiming to achieve computational efficiency while maintaining reasoning capabilities.\n  Our approach centers on a TreeFFN Encoder-Decoder mechanism: $$\\text{Encoder TreeFFN (L} \\rightarrow \\text{R)} + \\text{Decoder TreeFFN (R} \\leftarrow \\text{L)} \\rightarrow \\text{Parallel Processing}$$ where the encoder processes left-to-right dependencies while the decoder handles right-to-left patterns, both using simple neighbor-to-neighbor connections. This design eliminates attention computation while maintaining sequence modeling capabilities.\n  We evaluate our approach on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, where TreeGPT achieves 99\\% validation accuracy using 3.16M parameters. The model converges within 1500 training steps and demonstrates 100\\% token-level accuracy on selected evaluation samples. Our preliminary results suggest that for certain structured reasoning tasks, specialized TreeFFN architectures may offer advantages over attention-based approaches.

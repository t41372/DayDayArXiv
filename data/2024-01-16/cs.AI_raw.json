    "abstract": "We introduce the first Natural Office Talkers in Settings of Far-field Audio\nRecordings (``NOTSOFAR-1'') Challenge alongside datasets and baseline system.\nThe challenge focuses on distant speaker diarization and automatic speech\nrecognition (DASR) in far-field meeting scenarios, with single-channel and\nknown-geometry multi-channel tracks, and serves as a launch platform for two\nnew datasets: First, a benchmarking dataset of 315 meetings, averaging 6\nminutes each, capturing a broad spectrum of real-world acoustic conditions and\nconversational dynamics. It is recorded across 30 conference rooms, featuring\n4-8 attendees and a total of 35 unique speakers. Second, a 1000-hour simulated\ntraining dataset, synthesized with enhanced authenticity for real-world\ngeneralization, incorporating 15,000 real acoustic transfer functions. The\ntasks focus on single-device DASR, where multi-channel devices always share the\nsame known geometry. This is aligned with common setups in actual conference\nrooms, and avoids technical complexities associated with multi-device tasks. It\nalso allows for the development of geometry-specific solutions. The NOTSOFAR-1\nChallenge aims to advance research in the field of distant conversational\nspeech recognition, providing key resources to unlock the potential of\ndata-driven methods, which we believe are currently constrained by the absence\nof comprehensive high-quality training and benchmarking datasets.",

Current L2I models\neither suffer from poor editability via text or weak alignment between the\ngenerated image and the input layout. This limits their usability in practice.\nTo mitigate this, we propose to integrate adversarial supervision into the\nconventional training pipeline of L2I diffusion models (ALDM). Specifically, we\nemploy a segmentation-based discriminator which provides explicit feedback to\nthe diffusion generator on the pixel-level alignment between the denoised image\nand the input layout. To encourage consistent adherence to the input layout\nover the sampling steps, we further introduce the multistep unrolling strategy.\nInstead of looking at a single timestep, we unroll a few steps recursively to\nimitate the inference process, and ask the discriminator to assess the\nalignment of denoised images with the layout over a certain time window. Our\nexperiments show that ALDM enables layout faithfulness of the generated images,\nwhile allowing broad editability via text prompts. Moreover, we showcase its\nusefulness for practical applications: by synthesizing target distribution\nsamples via text control, we improve domain generalization of semantic\nsegmentation models by a large margin (~12 mIoU points).",

Current\nmulti-modal large language models, however, passively absorb sensory data as\ninputs, lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D\nenvironment and dynamically collect their multisensory information. To usher in\nthe study of this area, we propose MultiPLY, a multisensory embodied large\nlanguage model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data, including\nvisual, audio, tactile, and thermal information into large language models,\nthereby establishing the correlation among words, actions, and percepts. To\nthis end, we first collect Multisensory Universe, a large-scale multisensory\ninteraction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied\nagent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with\npre-trained LLM on such generated data, we first encode the 3D scene as\nabstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens\ndenoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment,\nas well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of\nthe agent at each time step. In the inference time, MultiPLY could generate\naction tokens, instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and\nobtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then\nappended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action\ntokens. We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin\nthrough a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval, tool use,\nmultisensory captioning, and task decomposition.",

Human ToM, on the\nother hand, is more than video or text understanding. People can flexibly\nreason about another person's mind based on conceptual representations (e.g.,\ngoals, beliefs, plans) extracted from any available data. To address this, we\nintroduce a multimodal Theory of Mind question answering (MMToM-QA) benchmark.\nMMToM-QA comprehensively evaluates machine ToM both on multimodal data and on\ndifferent kinds of unimodal data about a person's activity in a household\nenvironment. To engineer multimodal ToM capacity, we propose a novel method,\nBIP-ALM (Bayesian Inverse Planning Accelerated by Language Models). BIP-ALM\nextracts unified representations from multimodal data and utilizes language\nmodels for scalable Bayesian inverse planning. We conducted a systematic\ncomparison of human performance, BIP-ALM, and state-of-the-art models,\nincluding GPT-4.

This immersive perspective brings dramatic visual changes and\nunique challenges compared to third-person views. Synthetic data has empowered\nthird-person-view vision models, but its application to embodied egocentric\nperception tasks remains largely unexplored. A critical challenge lies in\nsimulating natural human movements and behaviors that effectively steer the\nembodied cameras to capture a faithful egocentric representation of the 3D\nworld. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoGen, a new synthetic data\ngenerator that can produce accurate and rich ground-truth training data for\negocentric perception tasks. At the heart of EgoGen is a novel human motion\nsynthesis model that directly leverages egocentric visual inputs of a virtual\nhuman to sense the 3D environment. Combined with collision-avoiding motion\nprimitives and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach, our motion\nsynthesis model offers a closed-loop solution where the embodied perception and\nmovement of the virtual human are seamlessly coupled. Compared to previous\nworks, our model eliminates the need for a pre-defined global path, and is\ndirectly applicable to dynamic environments. Combined with our easy-to-use and\nscalable data generation pipeline, we demonstrate EgoGen's efficacy in three\ntasks: mapping and localization for head-mounted cameras, egocentric camera\ntracking, and human mesh recovery from egocentric views. EgoGen will be fully\nopen-sourced, offering a practical solution for creating realistic egocentric\ntraining data and aiming to serve as a useful tool for egocentric computer\nvision research.

Moreover, the causal relations between these concepts should\nbe captured by the explainer to allow for reasoning about the explanations.\nLastly, explanation methods should be efficient and not compromise the\nperformance of the predictive task. Despite the rapid advances in AI\nexplainability in recent years, as far as we know to date, no method fulfills\nthese three properties. Indeed, mainstream methods for local concept\nexplainability do not produce causal explanations and incur a trade-off between\nexplainability and prediction performance. We present DiConStruct, an\nexplanation method that is both concept-based and causal, with the goal of\ncreating more interpretable local explanations in the form of structural causal\nmodels and concept attributions. Our explainer works as a distillation model to\nany black-box machine learning model by approximating its predictions while\nproducing the respective explanations. Because of this, DiConStruct generates\nexplanations efficiently while not impacting the black-box prediction task. We\nvalidate our method on an image dataset and a tabular dataset, showing that\nDiConStruct approximates the black-box models with higher fidelity than other\nconcept explainability baselines, while providing explanations that include the\ncausal relations between the concepts.",

However, CORL faces challenges\nin balancing stability and plasticity. Existing methods, employing Actor-Critic\nstructures and experience replay (ER), suffer from distribution shifts, low\nefficiency, and weak knowledge-sharing. We aim to investigate whether Decision\nTransformer (DT), another offline RL paradigm, can serve as a more suitable\noffline continuous learner to address these issues. We first compare AC-based\noffline algorithms with DT in the CORL framework. DT offers advantages in\nlearning efficiency, distribution shift mitigation, and zero-shot\ngeneralization but exacerbates the forgetting problem during supervised\nparameter updates. We introduce multi-head DT (MH-DT) and low-rank adaptation\nDT (LoRA-DT) to mitigate DT's forgetting problem. MH-DT stores task-specific\nknowledge using multiple heads, facilitating knowledge sharing with common\ncomponents. It employs distillation and selective rehearsal to enhance current\ntask learning when a replay buffer is available. In buffer-unavailable\nscenarios, LoRA-DT merges less influential weights and fine-tunes DT's decisive\nMLP layer to adapt to the current task.

Playful interactions emerged as an\nimportant way for users to make sense of the ever-changing AI technologies, yet\nremained underexamined. We target this gap by investigating playful\ninteractions exhibited by users of a popular AI technology, ChatGPT. Through a\nthematic analysis of 372 user-generated posts on the ChatGPT subreddit, we\nfound that more than half (54\\%) of user discourse revolved around playful\ninteractions. The analysis further allowed us to construct a preliminary\nframework to describe these interactions, categorizing them into six types:\nreflecting, jesting, imitating, challenging, tricking, and contriving; each\nincluded sub-categories. This study contributes to HCI and CSCW by identifying\nthe diverse ways users engage in playful interactions with AI. It examines how\nthese interactions can help users understand AI's agency, shape human-AI\nrelationships, and provide insights for designing AI systems.",

    "abstract": "The problem of traffic congestion not only causes a large amount of economic\nlosses, but also seriously endangers the urban environment. Predicting traffic\ncongestion has important practical significance. So far, most studies have been\nbased on historical data from sensors placed on different roads to predict\nfuture traffic flow and speed, to analyze the traffic congestion conditions of\na certain road segment. However, due to the fixed position of sensors, it is\ndifficult to mine new information. On the other hand, vehicle trajectory data\nis more flexible and can extract traffic information as needed. Therefore, we\nproposed a new traffic congestion prediction model - Multi Adjacency\nrelationship Attention Graph Convolutional Networks(MA2GCN). This model\ntransformed vehicle trajectory data into graph structured data in grid form,\nand proposed a vehicle entry and exit matrix based on the mobility between\ndifferent grids. At the same time, in order to improve the performance of the\nmodel, this paper also built a new adaptive adjacency matrix generation method\nand adjacency matrix attention module. This model mainly used gated temporal\nconvolution and graph convolution to extract temporal and spatial information,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "In large language models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the\nMixture of Experts paradigm has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing\nmodel expressiveness and accuracy. However, deploying GPT MoE models for\nparallel inference on distributed systems presents significant challenges,\nprimarily due to the extensive Alltoall communication required for expert\nrouting and aggregation. This communication bottleneck exacerbates the already\ncomplex computational landscape, hindering the efficient utilization of\nhigh-performance computing resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight\noptimization technique called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of\nthese MoE models. We take a new perspective on alleviating the communication\noverhead by exploiting the inter-layer expert affinity. Unlike previous\nmethods, our solution can be directly applied to pre-trained MoE models without\nany fine-tuning or accuracy degradation. By proposing a context-coherent expert\nparallelism on distributed systems, our design only uses one Alltoall\ncommunication to deliver the same functionality while previous methods all\nrequire two Alltoalls. By carefully examining the conditional probability in\ntokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE\nmodels implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity. We then design\nan efficient integer programming model to capture such features and show that\nby properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67%\ncross-GPU routing latency. Our solution beats the cutting-edge MoE\nimplementations with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2x improvement in\ninference throughput. We further provide a detailed study of how the model\nimplicitly acquires this expert affinity at the very early training stage and\nhow this affinity evolves and stabilizes during training.",

On the basis of our empirical\nstudy, we discover that training on good-practice commits significantly\ncontributes to the commit message generation. Motivated by this finding, we\npropose a novel knowledge-aware denoising learning method called KADEL.\nConsidering that good-practice commits constitute only a small proportion of\nthe dataset, we align the remaining training samples with these good-practice\ncommits. To achieve this, we propose a model that learns the commit knowledge\nby training on good-practice commits.

However, since the supplementary information may contain noise or\nprediction errors, we propose a dynamic denoising training method.

It sequences exercises that maximize\nlearning progress for each student. While previous studies demonstrated its\nefficacy in enhancing learning compared to hand-made curricula, its impact on\nstudent motivation remained unexplored. Furthermore, ZPDES previously lacked\nfeatures allowing student choice, a limitation in agency that conflicts with\nits foundation on models of curiosity-driven learning.

Results show that\nZPDES improves both learning performance and the learning experience. Moreover\nadding choice to ZPDES enhances intrinsic motivation and further strengthens\nits learning benefits. In contrast, incorporating choice into a fixed, linear\ncurriculum negatively impacts learning outcomes.

Nevertheless, numerous\nstudies and examples have shown that the PGA methods may fail to achieve the\ntight approximation ratio for continuous DR-submodular maximization problems.\nTo address this challenge, we present a boosting technique in this paper, which\ncan efficiently improve the approximation guarantee of the standard PGA to\n\\emph{optimal} with only small modifications on the objective function. The\nfundamental idea of our boosting technique is to exploit non-oblivious search\nto derive a novel auxiliary function $F$, whose stationary points are excellent\napproximations to the global maximum of the original DR-submodular objective\n$f$. Specifically, when $f$ is monotone and $\\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular, we\npropose an auxiliary function $F$ whose stationary points can provide a better\n$(1-e^{-\\gamma})$-approximation than the\n$(\\gamma^2/(1+\\gamma^2))$-approximation guaranteed by the stationary points of\n$f$ itself. Similarly, for the non-monotone case, we devise another auxiliary\nfunction $F$ whose stationary points can achieve an optimal\n$\\frac{1-\\min_{\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}}\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|_{\\infty}}{4}$-approximation\nguarantee where $\\mathcal{C}$ is a convex constraint set. In contrast, the\nstationary points of the original non-monotone DR-submodular function can be\narbitrarily bad~\\citep{chen2023continuous}. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nscalability of our boosting technique on four problems. In all of these four\nproblems, our resulting variants of boosting PGA algorithm beat the previous\nstandard PGA in several aspects such as approximation ratio and efficiency.\nFinally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments,\nwhich demonstrate the effectiveness of our boosting PGA methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents null-shot prompting. Null-shot prompting exploits\nhallucination in large language models (LLMs) by instructing LLMs to utilize\ninformation from the \"Examples\" section that never exists within the provided\ncontext to perform a task. While reducing hallucination is crucial and\nnon-negligible for daily and critical uses of LLMs, we propose that in the\ncurrent landscape in which these LLMs still hallucinate, it is possible, in\nfact, to exploit hallucination to increase performance in performing tasks\ncompared to standard zero-shot prompting. Experiments with eight LLMs show\nimprovements in performance across the majority of eight datasets, including\nreading comprehension, arithmetic reasoning, and closed-book question\nanswering. The observed inconsistency in increased relative performance across\nthe LLMs also potentially indicates a different degree of inherent\nhallucination in each model. These differences show that it is possible to\nutilize null-shot prompting as a way to detect degrees of hallucination in LLMs\nusing existing benchmarking datasets. We also perform ablation studies,\nincluding experimenting with a modified version of null-shot prompting that\nincorporates ideas from zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which shows\ndifferent trends of results.",

These attacks, however, generally assume that the victim model is\nmonolingual and cannot be used to target multilingual victim models, a\nsignificant limitation given the increased use of these models. For this\nreason, in this work we propose an approach to fine-tune a multilingual\nparaphrase model with an adversarial objective so that it becomes able to\ngenerate effective adversarial examples against multilingual classifiers. The\ntraining objective incorporates a set of pre-trained models to ensure text\nquality and language consistency of the generated text. In addition, all the\nmodels are suitably connected to the generator by vocabulary-mapping matrices,\nallowing for full end-to-end differentiability of the overall training\npipeline. The experimental validation over two multilingual datasets and five\nlanguages has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to\nexisting baselines, particularly in terms of query efficiency.

We defined These data forms as \"Indefinite Data\", characterized by\nmulti-structure data and multi-value representations.

To\naddress the dataset gap, we release two high-quality datasets - Causalogue and\nCausaction, containing text dialogue samples and video action samples with\ncausal annotations respectively. Moreover, the method gap arises from the\ncoexistence of multi-structure data and multi-value representations, breaking\nthe assumptions of all current methods and rendering them infeasible on\nIndefinite Data. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework as a\nbaseline, incorporating three designed highlights for this gap: 1) establishing\nCausation Condition of representations using the independence of noise terms\nunder non-fixed causal structures, 2) treating causal strength as a latent\nvariable and measuring the reconstruction loss in the correlation space, and 3)\nestimating the effects of latent confounders.

    "abstract": "Image compression constitutes a significant challenge amidst the era of\ninformation explosion. Recent studies employing deep learning methods have\ndemonstrated the superior performance of learning-based image compression\nmethods over traditional codecs. However, an inherent challenge associated with\nthese methods lies in their lack of interpretability. Following an analysis of\nthe varying degrees of compression degradation across different frequency\nbands, we propose the end-to-end optimized image compression model facilitated\nby the frequency-oriented transform. The proposed end-to-end image compression\nmodel consists of four components: spatial sampling, frequency-oriented\ntransform, entropy estimation, and frequency-aware fusion. The\nfrequency-oriented transform separates the original image signal into distinct\nfrequency bands, aligning with the human-interpretable concept. Leveraging the\nnon-overlapping hypothesis, the model enables scalable coding through the\nselective transmission of arbitrary frequency components. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate that our model outperforms all traditional codecs\nincluding next-generation standard H.266/VVC on MS-SSIM metric. Moreover,\nvisual analysis tasks (i.e., object detection and semantic segmentation) are\nconducted to verify the proposed compression method could preserve semantic\nfidelity besides signal-level precision.",

However, these models are computationally expensive. At\nscale, the cost of serving thousands of users increases massively affecting\nalso user experience. To address this problem, semantic caches are used to\ncheck for answers to similar queries (that may have been phrased differently)\nwithout hitting the LLM service. Due to the nature of these semantic cache\ntechniques that rely on query embeddings, there is a high chance of errors\nimpacting user confidence in the system.

    "abstract": "Early wildfire detection in remote and forest areas is crucial for minimizing\ndevastation and preserving ecosystems. Autonomous drones offer agile access to\nremote, challenging terrains, equipped with advanced imaging technology that\ndelivers both high-temporal and detailed spatial resolution, making them\nvaluable assets in the early detection and monitoring of wildfires. However,\nthe limited computation and battery resources of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\n(UAVs) pose significant challenges in implementing robust and efficient image\nclassification models. Current works in this domain often operate offline,\nemphasizing the need for solutions that can perform inference in real time,\ngiven the constraints of UAVs. To address these challenges, this paper aims to\ndevelop a real-time image classification and fire segmentation model. It\npresents a comprehensive investigation into hardware acceleration using the\nJetson Nano P3450 and the implications of TensorRT, NVIDIA's high-performance\ndeep-learning inference library, on fire classification accuracy and speed. The\nstudy includes implementations of Quantization Aware Training (QAT), Automatic\nMixed Precision (AMP), and post-training mechanisms, comparing them against the\nlatest baselines for fire segmentation and classification. All experiments\nutilize the FLAME dataset - an image dataset collected by low-altitude drones\nduring a prescribed forest fire. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts\nto enable real-time, on-board wildfire detection capabilities for UAVs,\naddressing speed and the computational and energy constraints of these crucial\nmonitoring systems. The results show a 13% increase in classification speed\ncompared to similar models without hardware optimization. Comparatively, loss\nand accuracy are within 1.225% of the original values.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel method for inpainting normal maps using a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN). Normal maps, often derived from a\nlightstage, are crucial in performance capture but can have obscured areas due\nto movement (e.g., by arms, hair, or props). Inpainting fills these missing\nareas with plausible data. Our approach extends previous general image\ninpainting techniques, employing a bow tie-like generator network and a\ndiscriminator network, with alternating training phases. The generator aims to\nsynthesize images aligning with the ground truth and deceive the discriminator,\nwhich differentiates between real and processed images. Periodically, the\ndiscriminator undergoes retraining to enhance its ability to identify processed\nimages. Importantly, our method adapts to the unique characteristics of normal\nmap data, necessitating modifications to the loss function. We utilize a cosine\nloss instead of mean squared error loss for generator training. Limited\ntraining data availability, even with synthetic datasets, demands significant\naugmentation, considering the specific nature of the input data. This includes\nappropriate image flipping and in-plane rotations to accurately alter normal\nvectors. Throughout training, we monitored key metrics such as average loss,\nStructural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n(PSNR) for the generator, along with average loss and accuracy for the\ndiscriminator. Our findings suggest that the proposed model effectively\ngenerates high-quality, realistic inpainted normal maps, suitable for\nperformance capture applications. These results establish a foundation for\nfuture research, potentially involving more advanced networks and comparisons\nwith inpainting of source images used to create the normal maps.",

Considering the popularity of mobile software applications\n(apps) among a wide range of individuals worldwide, mobile apps with unfair\nbehaviors and outcomes can affect a significant proportion of the global\npopulation, potentially more than any other type of software system. Users\nexpress a wide range of socio-technical concerns in mobile app reviews.

To this end, we first manually constructed a ground-truth\ndataset, including 1,132 fairness and 1,473 non-fairness reviews. Leveraging\nthe ground-truth dataset, we developed and evaluated a set of machine learning\nand deep learning models that distinguish fairness reviews from non-fairness\nreviews. Our experiments show that our best-performing model can detect\nfairness reviews with a precision of 94%. We then applied the best-performing\nmodel on approximately 9.5M reviews collected from 108 AI-based apps and\nidentified around 92K fairness reviews. Next, applying the K-means clustering\ntechnique to the 92K fairness reviews, followed by manual analysis, led to the\nidentification of six distinct types of fairness concerns (e.g., 'receiving\ndifferent quality of features and services in different platforms and devices'\nand 'lack of transparency and fairness in dealing with user-generated\ncontent'). Finally, the manual analysis of 2,248 app owners' responses to the\nfairness reviews identified six root causes (e.g., 'copyright issues') that app\nowners report to justify fairness concerns.",

    "abstract": "In medical image diagnosis, fairness has become increasingly crucial. Without\nbias mitigation, deploying unfair AI would harm the interests of the\nunderprivileged population and potentially tear society apart. Recent research\naddresses prediction biases in deep learning models concerning demographic\ngroups (e.g., gender, age, and race) by utilizing demographic (sensitive\nattribute) information during training. However, many sensitive attributes\nnaturally exist in dermatological disease images. If the trained model only\ntargets fairness for a specific attribute, it remains unfair for other\nattributes. Moreover, training a model that can accommodate multiple sensitive\nattributes is impractical due to privacy concerns. To overcome this, we propose\na method enabling fair predictions for sensitive attributes during the testing\nphase without using such information during training. Inspired by prior work\nhighlighting the impact of feature entanglement on fairness, we enhance the\nmodel features by capturing the features related to the sensitive and target\nattributes and regularizing the feature entanglement between corresponding\nclasses. This ensures that the model can only classify based on the features\nrelated to the target attribute without relying on features associated with\nsensitive attributes, thereby improving fairness and accuracy. Additionally, we\nuse disease masks from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance the quality\nof the learned feature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can improve fairness in classification compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods in two dermatological disease datasets.",

One example is\ngenerating academic reports or papers with little to no human contribution.\nConsequently, researchers have focused on developing detectors to address the\nmisuse of LLMs. However, most existing methods prioritize achieving higher\naccuracy on restricted datasets, neglecting the crucial aspect of\ngeneralizability.

    "abstract": "The potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often remains underutilized in\nhandling complex text-based problems, particularly when these problems could\nbenefit from visual representation. Resonating with humans' ability to solve\ncomplex text-based problems by (1) creating a visual diagram from the problem\nand (2) deducing what steps they need to take to solve it, we propose\nSelf-Imagine. We leverage a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate a\nstructured representation of the question using HTML, then render the HTML as\nan image, and finally use the same VLM to answer the question using both the\nquestion and the image. Our approach does not require any additional training\ndata or training. We evaluate our approach on three mathematics tasks and nine\ngeneral-purpose reasoning tasks using state-of-the-art (LLAVA-1.5 and GEMINI\nPRO) VLMs. Our approach boosts the performance of LLAVA-1.5 and GEMINI PRO on\nall math tasks (on average GSM8K: +3.1%; ASDIV: +3.2%; SVAMP: +6.9%) and the\nmajority of the general-purpose reasoning tasks by 3.2% to 6.0% on average.",

    "abstract": "Considering data insufficiency in metal additive manufacturing (AM), transfer\nlearning (TL) has been adopted to extract knowledge from source domains (e.g.,\ncompleted printings) to improve the modeling performance in target domains\n(e.g., new printings). Current applications use all accessible source data\ndirectly in TL with no regard to the similarity between source and target data.\nThis paper proposes a systematic method to find appropriate subsets of source\ndata based on similarities between the source and target datasets for a given\nset of limited target domain data. Such similarity is characterized by the\nspatial and model distance metrics. A Pareto frontier-based source data\nselection method is developed, where the source data located on the Pareto\nfrontier defined by two similarity distance metrics are selected iteratively.\nThe method is integrated into an instance-based TL method (decision tree\nregression model) and a model-based TL method (fine-tuned artificial neural\nnetwork). Both models are then tested on several regression tasks in metal AM.\nComparison results demonstrate that 1) the source data selection method is\ngeneral and supports integration with various TL methods and distance metrics,\n2) compared with using all source data, the proposed method can find a small\nsubset of source data from the same domain with better TL performance in metal\nAM regression tasks involving different processes and machines, and 3) when\nmultiple source domains exist, the source data selection method could find the\nsubset from one source domain to obtain comparable or better TL performance\nthan the model constructed using data from all source domains.",

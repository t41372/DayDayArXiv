    "abstract": "Regression is a fundamental task in machine learning that has garnered\nextensive attention over the past decades. The conventional approach for\nregression involves employing loss functions that primarily concentrate on\naligning model prediction with the ground truth for each individual data\nsample. Recent research endeavors have introduced novel perspectives by\nincorporating label similarity to regression via imposing extra pairwise\nregularization on the latent feature space and demonstrated the effectiveness.\nHowever, there are two drawbacks for those approaches: i) their pairwise\noperation in latent feature space is computationally more expensive than\nconventional regression losses; ii) it lacks of theoretical justifications\nbehind such regularization. In this work, we propose GAR (Gradient Aligned\nRegression) as a competitive alternative method in label space, which is\nconstituted by a conventional regression loss and two pairwise label difference\nlosses for gradient alignment including magnitude and direction. GAR enjoys: i)\nthe same level efficiency as conventional regression loss because the quadratic\ncomplexity for the proposed pairwise losses can be reduced to linear\ncomplexity; ii) theoretical insights from learning the pairwise label\ndifference to learning the gradient of the ground truth function. We limit our\ncurrent scope as regression on the clean data setting without noises, outliers\nor distributional shifts, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod practically on two synthetic datasets and on eight extensive real-world\ntasks from six benchmark datasets with other eight competitive baselines.\nRunning time experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed\nGAR over existing methods with pairwise regularization in latent feature space\nand ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component for GAR.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly common for representing\nlarge-scale linked data. However, their immense size has required graph\nlearning systems to assist humans in analysis, interpretation, and pattern\ndetection. While there have been promising results for researcher- and\nclinician- empowerment through a variety of KG learning systems, we identify\nfour key deficiencies in state-of-the-art graph learning that simultaneously\nlimit KG learning performance and diminish the ability of humans to interface\noptimally with these learning systems. These deficiencies are: 1) lack of\nexpert knowledge integration, 2) instability to node degree extremity in the\nKG, 3) lack of consideration for uncertainty and relevance while learning, and\n4) lack of explainability. Furthermore, we characterise state-of-the-art\nattempts to solve each of these problems and note that each attempt has largely\nbeen isolated from attempts to solve the other problems. Through a\nformalisation of these problems and a review of the literature that addresses\nthem, we adopt the position that not only are deficiencies in these four key\nareas holding back human-KG empowerment, but that the divide-and-conquer\napproach to solving these problems as individual units rather than a whole is a\nsignificant barrier to the interface between humans and KG learning systems. We\npropose that it is only through integrated, holistic solutions to the\nlimitations of KG learning systems that human and KG learning co-empowerment\nwill be efficiently affected. We finally present our \"Veni, Vidi, Vici\"\nframework that sets a roadmap for effectively and efficiently shifting to a\nholistic co-empowerment model in both the KG learning and the broader machine\nlearning domain.",

TWIG learns weights from inputs\nthat consist of topological features of the graph data, with no coding for\nlatent representations of entities or edges. Our experiments on the UMLS\ndataset show that a single TWIG neural network can predict the results of\nstate-of-the-art ComplEx-N3 KGE model nearly exactly on across all\nhyperparameter configurations. To do this it uses a total of 2590 learnable\nparameters, but accurately predicts the results of 1215 different\nhyperparameter combinations with a combined cost of 29,322,000 parameters.\nBased on these results, we make two claims: 1) that KGEs do not learn latent\nsemantics, but only latent representations of structural patterns; 2) that\nhyperparameter choice in KGEs is a deterministic function of the KGE model and\ngraph structure. We further hypothesise that, as TWIG can simulate KGEs without\nembeddings, that node and edge embeddings are not needed to learn to accurately\npredict new facts in KGs. Finally, we formulate all of our findings under the\numbrella of the ``Structural Generalisation Hypothesis\", which suggests that\n``twiggy\" embedding-free / data-structure-based learning methods can allow a\nsingle neural network to simulate KGE performance, and perhaps solve the Link\nPrediction task, across many KGs from diverse domains and with different\nsemantics.",

We extend this approach to the Positive Unlabeled (PU) setting, where\nonly a small set of labeled positives and a large unlabeled pool -- containing\nboth positives and negatives are available. We study this problem under two\nregimes: (i) without access to the class prior, and (ii) when the prior is\nknown or can be estimated. We introduce Positive Unlabeled Contrastive Learning\n(puCL), an unbiased and variance reducing contrastive objective that integrates\nweak supervision from labeled positives judiciously into the contrastive loss.\nWhen the class prior is known, we propose Positive Unlabeled InfoNCE (puNCE), a\nprior-aware extension that re-weights unlabeled samples as soft positive\nnegative mixtures. For downstream classification, we develop a pseudo-labeling\nalgorithm that leverages the structure of the learned embedding space via PU\naware clustering. Our framework is supported by theory; offering bias-variance\nanalysis, convergence insights, and generalization guarantees via augmentation\nconcentration; and validated empirically across standard PU benchmarks, where\nit consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-supervision\nregimes.",

Specifically, during the\ninitial phase of training, the DT-guided DRL yields up to an 184% increase in\naccumulated reward. Moreover, even after reaching convergence, it maintains a\nsuperior performance, ending with up to 53% more reward than standard DRL in\nlarge maze problems.

    "abstract": "As Vision Transformers (ViTs) increasingly set new benchmarks in computer\nvision, their practical deployment on inference engines is often hindered by\ntheir significant memory bandwidth and (on-chip) memory footprint requirements.\nThis paper addresses this memory limitation by introducing an activation-aware\nmodel compression methodology that uses selective low-rank weight tensor\napproximations of different layers to reduce the parameter count of ViTs. The\nkey idea is to decompose the weight tensors into a sum of two\nparameter-efficient tensors while minimizing the error between the product of\nthe input activations with the original weight tensor and the product of the\ninput activations with the approximate tensor sum. This approximation is\nfurther refined by adopting an efficient layer-wise error compensation\ntechnique that uses the gradient of the layer's output loss. The combination of\nthese techniques achieves excellent results while it avoids being trapped in a\nshallow local minimum early in the optimization process and strikes a good\nbalance between the model compression and output accuracy. Notably, the\npresented method significantly reduces the parameter count of DeiT-B by 60%\nwith less than 1% accuracy drop on the ImageNet dataset, overcoming the usual\naccuracy degradation seen in low-rank approximations. In addition to this, the\npresented compression technique can compress large DeiT/ViT models to have\nabout the same model size as smaller DeiT/ViT variants while yielding up to\n1.8% accuracy gain. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach,\npresenting a viable solution for embedding ViTs in memory-constrained\nenvironments without compromising their performance.",

    "abstract": "Classical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) assumes risk neutrality\nand complete objectivity for agents. However, in settings where agents need to\nconsider or model human economic or social preferences, a notion of risk must\nbe incorporated into the RL optimization problem. This will be of greater\nimportance in MARL where other human or non-human agents are involved, possibly\nwith their own risk-sensitive policies. In this work, we consider\nrisk-sensitive and non-cooperative MARL with cumulative prospect theory (CPT),\na non-convex risk measure and a generalization of coherent measures of risk.\nCPT is capable of explaining loss aversion in humans and their tendency to\noverestimate/underestimate small/large probabilities. We propose a distributed\nsampling-based actor-critic (AC) algorithm with CPT risk for network\naggregative Markov games (NAMGs), which we call Distributed Nested CPT-AC.\nUnder a set of assumptions, we prove the convergence of the algorithm to a\nsubjective notion of Markov perfect Nash equilibrium in NAMGs. The experimental\nresults show that subjective CPT policies obtained by our algorithm can be\ndifferent from the risk-neutral ones, and agents with a higher loss aversion\nare more inclined to socially isolate themselves in an NAMG.",

However, its\ncurrent model is trained on a diverse dataset not tailored to medical images,\nparticularly ultrasound images. Ultrasound images tend to have a lot of noise,\nmaking it difficult to segment out important structures. In this project, we\ndeveloped ClickSAM, which fine-tunes the Segment Anything Model using click\nprompts for ultrasound images. ClickSAM has two stages of training: the first\nstage is trained on single-click prompts centered in the ground-truth contours,\nand the second stage focuses on improving the model performance through\nadditional positive and negative click prompts. By comparing the first stage\npredictions to the ground-truth masks, true positive, false positive, and false\nnegative segments are calculated. Positive clicks are generated using the true\npositive and false negative segments, and negative clicks are generated using\nthe false positive segments. The Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation algorithm is\nthen employed to collect positive and negative click prompts in each segment\nthat are used to enhance the model performance during the second stage of\ntraining. With click-train methods, ClickSAM exhibits superior performance\ncompared to other existing models for ultrasound image segmentation.",

    "abstract": "In service-oriented architectures, accurately predicting the Quality of\nService (QoS) is crucial for maintaining reliability and enhancing user\nsatisfaction. However, significant challenges remain due to existing methods\nalways overlooking high-order latent collaborative relationships between users\nand services and failing to dynamically adjust feature learning for every\nspecific user-service invocation, which are critical for learning accurate\nfeatures. Additionally, reliance on RNNs for capturing QoS evolution hampers\nmodels' ability to detect long-term trends due to difficulties in managing\nlong-range dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose the\n\\underline{T}arget-Prompt \\underline{O}nline \\underline{G}raph\n\\underline{C}ollaborative \\underline{L}earning (TOGCL) framework for\ntemporal-aware QoS prediction. TOGCL leverages a dynamic user-service\ninvocation graph to model historical interactions, providing a comprehensive\nrepresentation of user-service relationships. Building on this graph, it\ndevelops a target-prompt graph attention network to extract online deep latent\nfeatures of users and services at each time slice, simultaneously considering\nimplicit collaborative relationships between target users/services and their\nneighbors, as well as relevant historical QoS values. Additionally, a\nmulti-layer Transformer encoder is employed to uncover temporal feature\nevolution patterns of users and services, leading to temporal-aware QoS\nprediction. Extensive experiments conducted on the WS-DREAM dataset demonstrate\nthat our proposed TOGCL framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods across multiple metrics, achieving improvements of up to 38.80\\%.

This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a\ngeneralizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can\nincorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment\nmultiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio,\nthermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human\nannotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we\nintroduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules\nassociated with each accessible modality.

Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive\nmultimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and\nmodality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across\nvarious assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM\nwhile improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language\nreasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA\nand Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance\nagainst strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while\nreducing over 90% trainable parameters.

With rapidly growing\ninterest in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf of\nhuman users, such LLM agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In this\npaper, we study how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We develop\nNegotiationArena: a flexible framework for evaluating and probing the\nnegotiation abilities of LLM agents. We implemented three types of scenarios in\nNegotiationArena to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources\n(ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games) and buy/sell goods\n(price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns of flexible\ndialogues between LLM agents to allow for more complex negotiations.\nInterestingly, LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by\nemploying certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolate\nand desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20\\% when negotiating against\nthe standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited\nby the LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together,\n\\NegotiationArena offers a new environment to investigate LLM interactions,\nenabling new insights into LLM's theory of mind, irrationality, and reasoning\nabilities.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing focus on adapting predictive models into agent-like\nsystems, most notably AI assistants based on language models. We outline two\nstructural reasons for why these models can fail when turned into agents.\nFirst, we discuss auto-suggestive delusions. Prior work has shown theoretically\nthat models fail to imitate agents that generated the training data if the\nagents relied on hidden observations: the hidden observations act as\nconfounding variables, and the models treat actions they generate as evidence\nfor nonexistent observations. Second, we introduce and formally study a\nrelated, novel limitation: predictor-policy incoherence. When a model generates\na sequence of actions, the model's implicit prediction of the policy that\ngenerated those actions can serve as a confounding variable. The result is that\nmodels choose actions as if they expect future actions to be suboptimal,\ncausing them to be overly conservative. We show that both of those failures are\nfixed by including a feedback loop from the environment, that is, re-training\nthe models on their own actions. We give simple demonstrations of both\nlimitations using Decision Transformers and confirm that empirical results\nagree with our conceptual and formal analysis. Our treatment provides a\nunifying view of those failure modes, and informs the question of why\nfine-tuning offline learned policies with online learning makes them more\neffective.",

To improve upon manually designed algorithms, the parameterization\nof this learned objective function must be expressive enough to represent novel\nprinciples of learning (instead of merely recovering already established ones)\nwhile still generalizing to a wide range of settings outside of its\nmeta-training distribution. However, existing methods focus on discovering\nobjective functions that, like many widely used objective functions in\nreinforcement learning, do not take into account the total number of steps\nallowed for training, or \"training horizon\". In contrast, humans use a plethora\nof different learning objectives across the course of acquiring a new ability.\nFor instance, students may alter their studying techniques based on the\nproximity to exam deadlines and their self-assessed capabilities. This paper\ncontends that ignoring the optimization time horizon significantly restricts\nthe expressive potential of discovered learning algorithms. We propose a simple\naugmentation to two existing objective discovery approaches that allows the\ndiscovered algorithm to dynamically update its objective function throughout\nthe agent's training procedure, resulting in expressive schedules and increased\ngeneralization across different training horizons. In the process, we find that\ncommonly used meta-gradient approaches fail to discover such adaptive objective\nfunctions while evolution strategies discover highly dynamic learning rules.

    "abstract": "Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) task tends to restore the details and\nvisual information from corrupted low-light images. Most existing methods learn\nthe mapping function between low/normal-light images by Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) on sRGB and HSV color space. Nevertheless, enhancement involves\namplifying image signals, and applying these color spaces to low-light images\nwith a low signal-to-noise ratio can introduce sensitivity and instability into\nthe enhancement process. Consequently, this results in the presence of color\nartifacts and brightness artifacts in the enhanced images. To alleviate this\nproblem, we propose a novel trainable color space, named\nHorizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI). It not only decouples brightness and color\nfrom RGB channels to mitigate the instability during enhancement but also\nadapts to low-light images in different illumination ranges due to the\ntrainable parameters. Further, we design a novel Color and Intensity Decoupling\nNetwork (CIDNet) with two branches dedicated to processing the decoupled image\nbrightness and color in the HVI space. Within CIDNet, we introduce the\nLightweight Cross-Attention (LCA) module to facilitate interaction between\nimage structure and content information in both branches, while also\nsuppressing noise in low-light images. Finally, we conducted 22 quantitative\nand qualitative experiments to show that the proposed CIDNet outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose R$^3$: Learning Reasoning through Reverse\nCurriculum Reinforcement Learning (RL), a novel method that employs only\noutcome supervision to achieve the benefits of process supervision for large\nlanguage models. The core challenge in applying RL to complex reasoning is to\nidentify a sequence of actions that result in positive rewards and provide\nappropriate supervision for optimization. Outcome supervision provides sparse\nrewards for final results without identifying error locations, whereas process\nsupervision offers step-wise rewards but requires extensive manual annotation.\nR$^3$ overcomes these limitations by learning from correct demonstrations.\nSpecifically, R$^3$ progressively slides the start state of reasoning from a\ndemonstration's end to its beginning, facilitating easier model exploration at\nall stages. Thus, R$^3$ establishes a step-wise curriculum, allowing outcome\nsupervision to offer step-level signals and precisely pinpoint errors. Using\nLlama2-7B, our method surpasses RL baseline on eight reasoning tasks by $4.1$\npoints on average. Notebaly, in program-based reasoning on GSM8K, it exceeds\nthe baseline by $4.2$ points across three backbone models, and without any\nextra data, Codellama-7B + R$^3$ performs comparable to larger models or\nclosed-source models.",

Our work InkSight, aims to bridge the gap by empowering physical\nnote-takers to effortlessly convert their work (offline handwriting) to digital\nink (online handwriting), a process we refer to as derendering. Prior research\non the topic has focused on the geometric properties of images, resulting in\nlimited generalization beyond their training domains. Our approach combines\nreading and writing priors, allowing training a model in the absence of large\namounts of paired samples, which are difficult to obtain. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first work that effectively derenders handwritten text in arbitrary\nphotos with diverse visual characteristics and backgrounds. Furthermore, it\ngeneralizes beyond its training domain into simple sketches. Our human\nevaluation reveals that 87% of the samples produced by our model on the\nchallenging HierText dataset are considered as a valid tracing of the input\nimage and 67% look like a pen trajectory traced by a human.",

    "abstract": "Learning in general-sum games often yields collectively sub-optimal results.\nAddressing this, opponent shaping (OS) methods actively guide the learning\nprocesses of other agents, empirically leading to improved individual and group\nperformances in many settings. Early OS methods use higher-order derivatives to\nshape the learning of co-players, making them unsuitable for shaping multiple\nlearning steps. Follow-up work, Model-free Opponent Shaping (M-FOS), addresses\nthese by reframing the OS problem as a meta-game. In contrast to early OS\nmethods, there is little theoretical understanding of the M-FOS framework.\nProviding theoretical guarantees for M-FOS is hard because A) there is little\nliterature on theoretical sample complexity bounds for meta-reinforcement\nlearning B) M-FOS operates in continuous state and action spaces, so\ntheoretical analysis is challenging. In this work, we present R-FOS, a tabular\nversion of M-FOS that is more suitable for theoretical analysis. R-FOS\ndiscretises the continuous meta-game MDP into a tabular MDP. Within this\ndiscretised MDP, we adapt the $R_{max}$ algorithm, most prominently used to\nderive PAC-bounds for MDPs, as the meta-learner in the R-FOS algorithm. We\nderive a sample complexity bound that is exponential in the cardinality of the\ninner state and action space and the number of agents. Our bound guarantees\nthat, with high probability, the final policy learned by an R-FOS agent is\nclose to the optimal policy, apart from a constant factor. Finally, we\ninvestigate how R-FOS's sample complexity scales in the size of state-action\nspace. Our theoretical results on scaling are supported empirically in the\nMatching Pennies environment.",

In order to enhance visual\nrecognition accuracy, the utilization of large-scale datasets is imperative for\ntraining models to acquire implicit knowledge related to the handling of\nvarious objects. Creating datasets from scratch is a time and labor-intensive\nprocess. Moreover, existing datasets often contain errors due to automated\nannotations aimed at expediency, making the improvement of these datasets a\nsubstantial research challenge. Consequently, several issues have been\nidentified in the annotation of grasp bounding boxes within the popular\nJacquard Grasp. We propose utilizing a Human-In-The-Loop(HIL) method to enhance\ndataset quality. This approach relies on backbone deep learning networks to\npredict object positions and orientations for robotic grasping. Predictions\nwith Intersection over Union (IOU) values below 0.2 undergo an assessment by\nhuman operators. After their evaluation, the data is categorized into False\nNegatives(FN) and True Negatives(TN). FN are then subcategorized into either\nmissing annotations or catastrophic labeling errors. Images lacking labels are\naugmented with valid grasp bounding box information, whereas images afflicted\nby catastrophic labeling errors are completely removed. The open-source tool\nLabelbee was employed for 53,026 iterations of HIL dataset enhancement, leading\nto the removal of 2,884 images and the incorporation of ground truth\ninformation for 30,292 images.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has shed light\non the risk of deep learning (DL) models exacerbating clinical biases towards\nvulnerable patient populations. While prior literature has focused on\nquantifying biases exhibited by trained DL models, demographically targeted\nadversarial bias attacks on DL models and its implication in the clinical\nenvironment remains an underexplored field of research in medical imaging. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that demographically targeted label poisoning attacks\ncan introduce undetectable underdiagnosis bias in DL models. Our results across\nmultiple performance metrics and demographic groups like sex, age, and their\nintersectional subgroups show that adversarial bias attacks demonstrate\nhigh-selectivity for bias in the targeted group by degrading group model\nperformance without impacting overall model performance. Furthermore, our\nresults indicate that adversarial bias attacks result in biased DL models that\npropagate prediction bias even when evaluated with external datasets.",

    "abstract": "Speech-driven 3D facial animation is important for many multimedia\napplications. Recent work has shown promise in using either Diffusion models or\nTransformer architectures for this task. However, their mere aggregation does\nnot lead to improved performance. We suspect this is due to a shortage of\npaired audio-4D data, which is crucial for the Transformer to effectively\nperform as a denoiser within the Diffusion framework. To tackle this issue, we\npresent DiffSpeaker, a Transformer-based network equipped with novel biased\nconditional attention modules. These modules serve as substitutes for the\ntraditional self/cross-attention in standard Transformers, incorporating\nthoughtfully designed biases that steer the attention mechanisms to concentrate\non both the relevant task-specific and diffusion-related conditions. We also\nexplore the trade-off between accurate lip synchronization and non-verbal\nfacial expressions within the Diffusion paradigm. Experiments show our model\nnot only achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, but also\nfast inference speed owing to its ability to generate facial motions in\nparallel.",

    "abstract": "The integration of physiological computing into mixed-initiative human-robot\ninteraction systems offers valuable advantages in autonomous task allocation by\nincorporating real-time features as human state observations into the\ndecision-making system. This approach may alleviate the cognitive load on human\noperators by intelligently allocating mission tasks between agents.\nNevertheless, accommodating a diverse pool of human participants with varying\nphysiological and behavioral measurements presents a substantial challenge. To\naddress this, resorting to a probabilistic framework becomes necessary, given\nthe inherent uncertainty and partial observability on the human's state. Recent\nresearch suggests to learn a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process\n(POMDP) model from a data set of previously collected experiences that can be\nsolved using Offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) methods. In the present work,\nwe not only highlight the potential of partially observable representations and\nphysiological measurements to improve human operator state estimation and\nperformance, but also enhance the overall mission effectiveness of a\nhuman-robot team. Importantly, as the fixed data set may not contain enough\ninformation to fully represent complex stochastic processes, we propose a\nmethod to incorporate model uncertainty, thus enabling risk-sensitive\nsequential decision-making. Experiments were conducted with a group of\ntwenty-six human participants within a simulated robot teleoperation\nenvironment, yielding empirical evidence of the method's efficacy. The obtained\nadaptive task allocation policy led to statistically significant higher scores\nthan the one that was used to collect the data set, allowing for generalization\nacross diverse participants also taking into account risk-sensitive metrics.",

To achieve this, we present\nMATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a\nuser's input query, enabling the LLM to take social consequences into account\nbefore responding.

    "abstract": "When humans and autonomous systems operate together as what we refer to as a\nhybrid team, we of course wish to ensure the team operates successfully and\neffectively. We refer to team members as agents. In our proposed framework, we\naddress the case of hybrid teams in which, at any time, only one team member\n(the control agent) is authorized to act as control for the team. To determine\nthe best selection of a control agent, we propose the addition of an AI manager\n(via Reinforcement Learning) which learns as an outside observer of the team.\nThe manager learns a model of behavior linking observations of agent\nperformance and the environment/world the team is operating in, and from these\nobservations makes the most desirable selection of a control agent. We restrict\nthe manager task by introducing a set of constraints. The manager constraints\nindicate acceptable team operation, so a violation occurs if the team enters a\ncondition which is unacceptable and requires manager intervention. To ensure\nminimal added complexity or potential inefficiency for the team, the manager\nshould attempt to minimize the number of times the team reaches a constraint\nviolation and requires subsequent manager intervention. Therefore our manager\nis optimizing its selection of authorized agents to boost overall team\nperformance while minimizing the frequency of manager intervention. We\ndemonstrate our manager performance in a simulated driving scenario\nrepresenting the case of a hybrid team of agents composed of a human driver and\nautonomous driving system. We perform experiments for our driving scenario with\ninterfering vehicles, indicating the need for collision avoidance and proper\nspeed control.

    "abstract": "Existing approaches to fairness in stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB)\nprimarily focus on exposure guarantee to individual arms. When arms are\nnaturally grouped by certain attribute(s), we propose Bi-Level Fairness, which\nconsiders two levels of fairness. At the first level, Bi-Level Fairness\nguarantees a certain minimum exposure to each group. To address the unbalanced\nallocation of pulls to individual arms within a group, we consider meritocratic\nfairness at the second level, which ensures that each arm is pulled according\nto its merit within the group. Our work shows that we can adapt a UCB-based\nalgorithm to achieve a Bi-Level Fairness by providing (i) anytime Group\nExposure Fairness guarantees and (ii) ensuring individual-level Meritocratic\nFairness within each group. We first show that one can decompose regret bounds\ninto two components: (a) regret due to anytime group exposure fairness and (b)\nregret due to meritocratic fairness within each group. Our proposed algorithm\nBF-UCB balances these two regrets optimally to achieve the upper bound of\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ on regret; $T$ being the stopping time. With the help of\nsimulated experiments, we further show that BF-UCB achieves sub-linear regret;\nprovides better group and individual exposure guarantees compared to existing\nalgorithms; and does not result in a significant drop in reward with respect to\nUCB algorithm, which does not impose any fairness constraint.",

Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by\nmessage passing to generate informative node features for various downstream\ntasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing\nHNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which\nlimits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative\napproach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the\nmodel learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing\nmodule, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing\nstage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph\nneural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically\nsupport the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is\nmore training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much\ninformation as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust\nagainst the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions.\nExperiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node\nclassification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art\nHNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training\nefficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN\noutperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with\njust 1% of the training time of that baseline.",

It then optimizes a policy on the\npenalized private model, without any further interaction with the system or\naccess to the dataset. In addition to offering strong theoretical foundations,\nwe demonstrate empirically that PriMORL enables the training of private RL\nagents on offline continuous control tasks with deep function approximations,\nwhereas current methods are limited to simpler tabular and linear Markov\nDecision Processes (MDPs). We furthermore outline the trade-offs involved in\nachieving privacy in this setting.",

    "abstract": "The growing concern about data privacy has led to the development of private\ninference (PI) frameworks in client-server applications which protects both\ndata privacy and model IP. However, the cryptographic primitives required yield\nsignificant latency overhead which limits its wide-spread application. At the\nsame time, changing environments demand the PI service to be robust against\nvarious naturally occurring and gradient-based perturbations. Despite several\nworks focused on the development of latency-efficient models suitable for PI,\nthe impact of these models on robustness has remained unexplored. Towards this\ngoal, this paper presents RLNet, a class of robust linearized networks that can\nyield latency improvement via reduction of high-latency ReLU operations while\nimproving the model performance on both clean and corrupted images. In\nparticular, RLNet models provide a \"triple win ticket\" of improved\nclassification accuracy on clean, naturally perturbed, and gradient-based\nperturbed images using a shared-mask shared-weight architecture with over an\norder of magnitude fewer ReLUs than baseline models. To demonstrate the\nefficacy of RLNet, we perform extensive experiments with ResNet and WRN model\nvariants on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. Our experimental\nevaluations show that RLNet can yield models with up to 11.14x fewer ReLUs,\nwith accuracy close to the all-ReLU models, on clean, naturally perturbed, and\ngradient-based perturbed images. Compared with the SoTA non-robust linearized\nmodels at similar ReLU budgets, RLNet achieves an improvement in adversarial\naccuracy of up to ~47%, naturally perturbed accuracy up to ~16.4%, while\nimproving clean image accuracy up to ~1.5%.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Assess whether ChatGPT 4.0 is accurate enough to perform research\nevaluations on journal articles to automate this time-consuming task.\nDesign/methodology/approach: Test the extent to which ChatGPT-4 can assess the\nquality of journal articles using a case study of the published scoring\nguidelines of the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 to create a\nresearch evaluation ChatGPT. This was applied to 51 of my own articles and\ncompared against my own quality judgements. Findings: ChatGPT-4 can produce\nplausible document summaries and quality evaluation rationales that match the\nREF criteria. Its overall scores have weak correlations with my self-evaluation\nscores of the same documents (averaging r=0.281 over 15 iterations, with 8\nbeing statistically significantly different from 0). In contrast, the average\nscores from the 15 iterations produced a statistically significant positive\ncorrelation of 0.509. Thus, averaging scores from multiple ChatGPT-4 rounds\nseems more effective than individual scores. The positive correlation may be\ndue to ChatGPT being able to extract the author's significance, rigour, and\noriginality claims from inside each paper. If my weakest articles are removed,\nthen the correlation with average scores (r=0.200) falls below statistical\nsignificance, suggesting that ChatGPT struggles to make fine-grained\nevaluations. Research limitations: The data is self-evaluations of a\nconvenience sample of articles from one academic in one field. Practical\nimplications: Overall, ChatGPT does not yet seem to be accurate enough to be\ntrusted for any formal or informal research quality evaluation tasks. Research\nevaluators, including journal editors, should therefore take steps to control\nits use.

    "abstract": "Numerous mobile apps have leveraged deep learning capabilities. However,\non-device models are vulnerable to attacks as they can be easily extracted from\ntheir corresponding mobile apps. Existing on-device attacking approaches only\ngenerate black-box attacks, which are far less effective and efficient than\nwhite-box strategies. This is because mobile deep learning frameworks like\nTFLite do not support gradient computing, which is necessary for white-box\nattacking algorithms. Thus, we argue that existing findings may underestimate\nthe harmfulness of on-device attacks. To this end, we conduct a study to answer\nthis research question: Can on-device models be directly attacked via white-box\nstrategies? We first systematically analyze the difficulties of transforming\nthe on-device model to its debuggable version, and propose a Reverse\nEngineering framework for On-device Models (REOM), which automatically reverses\nthe compiled on-device TFLite model to the debuggable model. Specifically, REOM\nfirst transforms compiled on-device models into Open Neural Network Exchange\nformat, then removes the non-debuggable parts, and converts them to the\ndebuggable DL models format that allows attackers to exploit in a white-box\nsetting. Our experimental results show that our approach is effective in\nachieving automated transformation among 244 TFLite models. Compared with\nprevious attacks using surrogate models, REOM enables attackers to achieve\nhigher attack success rates with a hundred times smaller attack perturbations.\nIn addition, because the ONNX platform has plenty of tools for model format\nexchanging, the proposed method based on the ONNX platform can be adapted to\nother model formats. Our findings emphasize the need for developers to\ncarefully consider their model deployment strategies, and use white-box methods\nto evaluate the vulnerability of on-device models.",

To automate the identification of valid and invalid\nnarratives, we train and validate nine Machine Learning models on the\nclassified datasets. Leveraging these models, we extend our analysis to predict\nthe classifications of the remaining 21,120 narratives. All the ML models\nexcelled at classifying valid narratives as valid, but experienced challenges\nat simultaneously classifying invalid narratives as invalid.

    "abstract": "While mixture density networks (MDNs) have been extensively used for\nregression tasks, they have not been used much for classification tasks. One\nreason for this is that the usability of MDNs for classification is not clear\nand straightforward. In this paper, we propose two MDN-based models for\nclassification tasks. Both models fit mixtures of Gaussians to the the data and\nuse the fitted distributions to classify a given sample by evaluating the\nlearnt cumulative distribution function for the given input features. While the\nproposed MDN-based models perform slightly better than, or on par with, five\nbaseline classification models on three publicly available datasets, the real\nutility of our models comes out through a real-world product bundling\napplication. Specifically, we use our MDN-based models to learn the\nwillingness-to-pay (WTP) distributions for two products from synthetic sales\ndata of the individual products. The Gaussian mixture representation of the\nlearnt WTP distributions is then exploited to obtain the WTP distribution of\nthe bundle consisting of both the products. The proposed MDN-based models are\nable to approximate the true WTP distributions of both products and the bundle\nwell.",

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and\nwidely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics\nfunction. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in\ndifferentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients\nof the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a\nresult, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be\nlearned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of\nprior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned\nto directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient\nloss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI\nfor imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with\nhigh-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward\npolicy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15\nmodel-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional\nimage and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art\nmethods in both domains.

In recent years,\nphysics-informed machine learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in crowd simulation but fail to model the heterogeneity and\nmulti-modality of human movement comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a\nsocial physics-informed diffusion model named SPDiff to mitigate the above gap.\nSPDiff takes both the interactive and historical information of crowds in the\ncurrent timeframe to reverse the diffusion process, thereby generating the\ndistribution of pedestrian movement in the subsequent timeframe. Inspired by\nthe well-known social physics model, i.e., Social Force, regarding crowd\ndynamics, we design a crowd interaction module to guide the denoising process\nand further enhance this module with the equivariant properties of crowd\ninteractions. To mitigate error accumulation in long-term simulations, we\npropose a multi-frame rollout training algorithm for diffusion modeling.\nExperiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of SPDiff in terms of macroscopic and microscopic evaluation\nmetrics.

We introduce Learning\nPrinciples (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on\nthese few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit\ntask-specific \"principles\" from them, which help solve similar problems and\navoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test\nquestions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general\nprinciples. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop\nquestion answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning,\nand math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the\nstrongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and\nClaude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting\nusing GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA.

    "abstract": "Robotic systems are typically composed of various subsystems, such as\nlocalization and navigation, each encompassing numerous configurable components\n(e.g., selecting different planning algorithms). Once an algorithm has been\nselected for a component, its associated configuration options must be set to\nthe appropriate values. Configuration options across the system stack interact\nnon-trivially. Finding optimal configurations for highly configurable robots to\nachieve desired performance poses a significant challenge due to the\ninteractions between configuration options across software and hardware that\nresult in an exponentially large and complex configuration space. These\nchallenges are further compounded by the need for transferability between\ndifferent environments and robotic platforms. Data efficient optimization\nalgorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization) have been increasingly employed to\nautomate the tuning of configurable parameters in cyber-physical systems.\nHowever, such optimization algorithms converge at later stages, often after\nexhausting the allocated budget (e.g., optimization steps, allotted time) and\nlacking transferability. This paper proposes CURE -- a method that identifies\ncausally relevant configuration options, enabling the optimization process to\noperate in a reduced search space, thereby enabling faster optimization of\nrobot performance. CURE abstracts the causal relationships between various\nconfiguration options and robot performance objectives by learning a causal\nmodel in the source (a low-cost environment such as the Gazebo simulator) and\napplying the learned knowledge to perform optimization in the target (e.g.,\nTurtlebot 3 physical robot). We demonstrate the effectiveness and\ntransferability of CURE by conducting experiments that involve varying degrees\nof deployment changes in both physical robots and simulation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in various high-impact applications, including\nfraud detection and content recommendation. Despite the success of TGNNs, they\nare prone to the prevalent noise found in real-world dynamic graphs like\ntime-deprecated links and skewed interaction distribution. The noise causes two\ncritical issues that significantly compromise the accuracy of TGNNs: (1) models\nare supervised by inferior interactions, and (2) noisy input induces high\nvariance in the aggregated messages. However, current TGNN denoising techniques\ndo not consider the diverse and dynamic noise pattern of each node. In\naddition, they also suffer from the excessive mini-batch generation overheads\ncaused by traversing more neighbors. We believe the remedy for fast and\naccurate TGNNs lies in temporal adaptive sampling. In this work, we propose\nTASER, the first adaptive sampling method for TGNNs optimized for accuracy,\nefficiency, and scalability. TASER adapts its mini-batch selection based on\ntraining dynamics and temporal neighbor selection based on the contextual,\nstructural, and temporal properties of past interactions. To alleviate the\nbottleneck in mini-batch generation, TASER implements a pure GPU-based temporal\nneighbor finder and a dedicated GPU feature cache. We evaluate the performance\nof TASER using two state-of-the-art backbone TGNNs. On five popular datasets,\nTASER outperforms the corresponding baselines by an average of 2.3% in Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) while achieving an average of 5.1x speedup in training\ntime.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multimodal\nlearning systems (MMLS) have gained traction for their ability to process and\nintegrate information from diverse modality inputs. Their expanding use in\nvital sectors such as healthcare has made safety assurance a critical concern.\nHowever, the absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant\nbarrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first\ntaxonomy that systematically categorizes and assesses MMLS safety. This\ntaxonomy is structured around four fundamental pillars that are critical to\nensuring the safety of MMLS: robustness, alignment, monitoring, and\ncontrollability. Leveraging this taxonomy, we review existing methodologies,\nbenchmarks, and the current state of research, while also pinpointing the\nprincipal limitations and gaps in knowledge. Finally, we discuss unique\nchallenges in MMLS safety. In illuminating these challenges, we aim to pave the\nway for future research, proposing potential directions that could lead to\nsignificant advancements in the safety protocols of MMLS.",

    "abstract": "People aptly exhibit general intelligence behaviors in solving a variety of\ntasks with flexibility and ability to adapt to novel situations by reusing and\napplying high-level knowledge acquired over time. But artificial agents are\nmore like specialists, lacking such generalist behaviors. Artificial agents\nwill require understanding and exploiting critical structured knowledge\nrepresentations. We present a metacognitive generalization framework,\nKnowledge-Interaction-eXecution (KIX), and argue that interactions with objects\nleveraging type space facilitate the learning of transferable interaction\nconcepts and generalization. It is a natural way of integrating knowledge into\nreinforcement learning and is promising to act as an enabler for autonomous and\ngeneralist behaviors in artificial intelligence systems.",

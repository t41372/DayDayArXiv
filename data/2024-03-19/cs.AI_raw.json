    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are trained to minimize the rendering loss of\npredicted viewpoints. However, the photometric loss often does not provide\nenough information to disambiguate between different possible geometries\nyielding the same image. Previous work has thus incorporated depth supervision\nduring NeRF training, leveraging dense predictions from pre-trained depth\nnetworks as pseudo-ground truth. While these depth priors are assumed to be\nperfect once filtered for noise, in practice, their accuracy is more\nchallenging to capture. This work proposes a novel approach to uncertainty in\ndepth priors for NeRF supervision. Instead of using custom-trained depth or\nuncertainty priors, we use off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion models to predict\ndepth and capture uncertainty during the denoising process. Because we know\nthat depth priors are prone to errors, we propose to supervise the ray\ntermination distance distribution with Earth Mover's Distance instead of\nenforcing the rendered depth to replicate the depth prior exactly through\nL2-loss. Our depth-guided NeRF outperforms all baselines on standard depth\nmetrics by a large margin while maintaining performance on photometric\nmeasures.",

    "abstract": "The performance of deep models, including Vision Transformers, is known to be\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. Many existing defenses against these\nattacks, such as adversarial training, rely on full-model fine-tuning to induce\nrobustness in the models. These defenses require storing a copy of the entire\nmodel, that can have billions of parameters, for each task. At the same time,\nparameter-efficient prompt tuning is used to adapt large transformer-based\nmodels to downstream tasks without the need to save large copies. In this\npaper, we examine parameter-efficient prompt tuning of Vision Transformers for\ndownstream tasks under the lens of robustness. We show that previous\nadversarial defense methods, when applied to the prompt tuning paradigm, suffer\nfrom gradient obfuscation and are vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We introduce\nADAPT, a novel framework for performing adaptive adversarial training in the\nprompt tuning paradigm. Our method achieves competitive robust accuracy of ~40%\nw.r.t. SOTA robustness methods using full-model fine-tuning, by tuning only ~1%\nof the number of parameters.",

Computing\nthe optimal (i.e., most likely) word sequence starting with a given initial\nstate is an intractable problem, so we propose methods to compute highly likely\nsequences of $N$ words in time that is a low order polynomial in $N$ and in the\nvocabulary size of the $n$-gram.

In\nour case we use a greedy heuristic that generates as next word one that has the\nhighest probability. We show with analysis, examples, and computational\nexperimentation that our methods are capable of generating highly likely\nsequences with a modest increase in computation over the greedy heuristic.\nWhile our analysis and experiments are focused on Markov chains of the type\narising in transformer and ChatGPT-like models, our methods apply to general\nfinite-state Markov chains, and related inference applications of Hidden Markov\nModels (HMM), where Viterbi decoding is used extensively.",

This scoping review\naims to comprehensively review label noise management in deep learning-based\nmedical prediction problems, which includes label noise detection, label noise\nhandling, and evaluation.

HuLP offers an innovative approach that enables human\nexpert intervention, empowering clinicians to interact with and correct models'\npredictions, thus fostering collaboration between humans and AI models to\nproduce more accurate prognosis. Additionally, HuLP addresses the challenges of\nmissing data by utilizing neural networks and providing a tailored methodology\nthat effectively handles missing data. Traditional methods often struggle to\ncapture the nuanced variations within patient populations, leading to\ncompromised prognostic predictions. HuLP imputes missing covariates based on\nimaging features, aligning more closely with clinician workflows and enhancing\nreliability.

In contrast, our\nTexTile metric effectively evaluates the tileable properties of a texture,\nopening the door to more informed synthesis and analysis of tileable textures.\nUnder the hood, TexTile is formulated as a binary classifier carefully built\nfrom a large dataset of textures of different styles, semantics, regularities,\nand human annotations.Key to our method is a set of architectural modifications\nto baseline pre-train image classifiers to overcome their shortcomings at\nmeasuring tileability, along with a custom data augmentation and training\nregime aimed at increasing robustness and accuracy. We demonstrate that TexTile\ncan be plugged into different state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods,\nincluding diffusion-based strategies, and generate tileable textures while\nkeeping or even improving the overall texture quality.

Despite their\npromise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain\nshifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time\nPrototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt\nVLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the\nnotion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By\npre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text\nencoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for\nsubsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current\nadvancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift\nvectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively\nbridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect\nof our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands\nwhen compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations\nacross 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts\nand cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual\nreasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults while reducing resource requirements.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models can perform well on in-distribution data but often\nfail on biased subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data,\nhindering the robustness of models for reliable applications. Such subgroups\nare typically unknown due to the absence of subgroup labels. Discovering biased\nsubgroups is the key to understanding models' failure modes and further\nimproving models' robustness. Most previous works of subgroup discovery make an\nimplicit assumption that models only underperform on a single biased subgroup,\nwhich does not hold on in-the-wild data where multiple biased subgroups exist.\n  In this work, we propose Decomposition, Interpretation, and Mitigation (DIM),\na novel method to address a more challenging but also more practical problem of\ndiscovering multiple biased subgroups in image classifiers. Our approach\ndecomposes the image features into multiple components that represent multiple\nsubgroups. This decomposition is achieved via a bilinear dimension reduction\nmethod, Partial Least Square (PLS), guided by useful supervision from the image\nclassifier. We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup\ncomponent by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language\nfoundation models. Finally, DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups\nsimultaneously via two strategies, including the data- and model-centric\nstrategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased\nsubgroups. Furthermore, DIM uncovers the failure modes of the classifier on\nHard ImageNet, showcasing its broader applicability to understanding model bias\nin image classifiers.

However, the traditional\nway of training those models from many pre-annotated images leaves several\nunanswered questions. Hence methodologies, such as Feature Learning from Image\nMarkers (FLIM), have involved an expert in the learning loop to reduce human\neffort in data annotation and build models sufficiently deep for a given\nproblem. FLIM has been successfully used to create encoders, estimating the\nfilters of all convolutional layers from patches centered at marker voxels. In\nthis work, we present Multi-Step (MS) FLIM - a user-assisted approach to\nestimating and selecting the most relevant filters from multiple FLIM\nexecutions. MS-FLIM is used only for the first convolutional layer, and the\nresults already indicate improvement over FLIM. For evaluation, we build a\nsimple U-shaped encoder-decoder network, named sU-Net, for glioblastoma\nsegmentation using T1Gd and FLAIR MRI scans, varying the encoder's training\nmethod, using FLIM, MS-FLIM, and backpropagation algorithm. Also, we compared\nthese sU-Nets with two State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep-learning models using two\ndatasets. The results show that the sU-Net based on MS-FLIM outperforms the\nother training methods and achieves effectiveness within the standard\ndeviations of the SOTA models.",

The most relevant passages from these\ndocuments are presented along with links to the original documents and the\ngenerated queries, enabling users to dissect and leverage the information for\ntheir unique circumstances. The system successfully overcomes two predominant\nchallenges: understanding complex user inputs, and delivering accurate answers,\nfree of hallucinations, that passengers can rely on for making informed\ndecisions. A user study comparing the chatbot to a Google search demonstrated\nthe chatbot's usefulness and ease of use. Beyond the primary goal of providing\naccurate and timely information to air passengers regarding their rights, we\nhope that this system will also enable further research exploring the tradeoff\nbetween the user-friendly conversational interface of chatbots and the accuracy\nof retrieval systems.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBMs) are often used for\nsemi-supervised anomaly detection, where they are trained using only normal\ndata points. In GBRBM-based anomaly detection, normal and anomalous data are\nclassified based on a score that is identical to an energy function of the\nmarginal GBRBM. However, the classification threshold is difficult to set to an\nappropriate value, as this score cannot be interpreted. In this study, we\npropose a measure that improves score's interpretability based on its\ncumulative distribution, and establish a guideline for setting the threshold\nusing the interpretable measure. The results of numerical experiments show that\nthe guideline is reasonable when setting the threshold solely using normal data\npoints. Moreover, because identifying the measure involves computationally\ninfeasible evaluation of the minimum score value, we also propose an evaluation\nmethod for the minimum score based on simulated annealing, which is widely used\nfor optimization problems. The proposed evaluation method was also validated\nusing numerical experiments.",

This\nresearch area, particularly in the context of DRS, is nascent and faces three\ncore challenges.

Secondly, the\nexisting literature's lack of detailed analysis on selection attributes, based\non large-scale datasets and a thorough comparison among selection techniques\nand DRS backbones, restricts the generalizability of findings and impedes\ndeployment on DRS.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become vitally important in modern recommender\nsystems, effectively improving performance and interpretability. Fundamentally,\nrecommender systems aim to identify user interests based on historical\ninteractions and recommend suitable items. However, existing works overlook two\nkey challenges: (1) an interest corresponds to a potentially large set of\nrelated items, and (2) the lack of explicit, fine-grained exploitation of KG\ninformation and interest connectivity. This leads to an inability to reflect\ndistinctions between entities and interests when modeling them in a single way.\nAdditionally, the granularity of concepts in the knowledge graphs used for\nrecommendations tends to be coarse, failing to match the fine-grained nature of\nuser interests. This homogenization limits the precise exploitation of\nknowledge graph data and interest connectivity. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce a novel embedding-based model called InBox. Specifically, various\nknowledge graph entities and relations are embedded as points or boxes, while\nuser interests are modeled as boxes encompassing interaction history.\nRepresenting interests as boxes enables containing collections of item points\nrelated to that interest. We further propose that an interest comprises diverse\nbasic concepts, and box intersection naturally supports concept combination.\nAcross three training steps, InBox significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods like HAKG and KGIN on recommendation tasks. Further analysis provides\nmeaningful insights into the variable value of different KG data for\nrecommendations. In summary, InBox advances recommender systems through\nbox-based interest and concept modeling for sophisticated knowledge graph\nexploitation.",

    "abstract": "Many NLP researchers rely on free computational services, such as Google\nColab, to fine-tune their Transformer models, causing a limitation for\nhyperparameter optimization (HPO) in long-text classification due to the method\nhaving quadratic complexity and needing a bigger resource. In Indonesian, only\na few works were found on long-text classification using Transformers. Most\nonly use a small amount of data and do not report any HPO. In this study, using\n18k news articles, we investigate which pretrained models are recommended to\nuse based on the output length of the tokenizer. We then compare some hacks to\nshorten and enrich the sequences, which are the removals of stopwords,\npunctuation, low-frequency words, and recurring words. To get a fair\ncomparison, we propose and run an efficient and dynamic HPO procedure that can\nbe done gradually on a limited resource and does not require a long-running\noptimization library. Using the best hack found, we then compare 512, 256, and\n128 tokens length. We find that removing stopwords while keeping punctuation\nand low-frequency words is the best hack. Some of our setups manage to\noutperform taking 512 first tokens using a smaller 128 or 256 first tokens\nwhich manage to represent the same information while requiring less\ncomputational resources. The findings could help developers to efficiently\npursue optimal performance of the models using limited resources.",

    "abstract": "The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have been accelerated by access to\nlarge-scale data and compute. These large-scale resources have been used to\ntrain progressively larger models which are resource intensive in terms of\ncompute, data, energy, and carbon emissions. These costs are becoming a new\ntype of entry barrier to researchers and practitioners with limited access to\nresources at such scale, particularly in the Global South. In this work, we\ntake a comprehensive look at the landscape of existing DL models for medical\nimage analysis tasks and demonstrate their usefulness in settings where\nresources are limited. To account for the resource consumption of DL models, we\nintroduce a novel measure to estimate the performance per resource unit, which\nwe call the PePR score. Using a diverse family of 131 unique DL architectures\n(spanning 1M to 130M trainable parameters) and three medical image datasets, we\ncapture trends about the performance-resource trade-offs. In applications like\nmedical image analysis, we argue that small-scale, specialized models are\nbetter than striving for large-scale models. Furthermore, we show that using\nexisting pretrained models that are fine-tuned on new data can significantly\nreduce the computational resources and data required compared to training\nmodels from scratch.

    "abstract": "This paper reviews Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) and its various\ndefinitions. Considering the principles respected in any society, TAI is often\ncharacterized by a few attributes, some of which have led to confusion in\nregulatory or engineering contexts. We argue against using terms such as\nResponsible or Ethical AI as substitutes for TAI. And to help clarify any\nconfusion, we suggest leaving them behind. Given the subjectivity and\ncomplexity inherent in TAI, developing a universal framework is deemed\ninfeasible. Instead, we advocate for approaches centered on addressing key\nattributes and properties such as fairness, bias, risk, security,\nexplainability, and reliability. We examine the ongoing regulatory landscape,\nwith a focus on initiatives in the EU, China, and the USA. We recognize that\ndifferences in AI regulations based on geopolitical and geographical reasons\npose an additional challenge for multinational companies. We identify risk as a\ncore factor in AI regulation and TAI. For example, as outlined in the EU-AI\nAct, organizations must gauge the risk level of their AI products to act\naccordingly (or risk hefty fines). We compare modalities of TAI implementation\nand how multiple cross-functional teams are engaged in the overall process.\nThus, a brute force approach for enacting TAI renders its efficiency and\nagility, moot. To address this, we introduce our framework\nSet-Formalize-Measure-Act (SFMA). Our solution highlights the importance of\ntransforming TAI-aware metrics, drivers of TAI, stakeholders, and\nbusiness/legal requirements into actual benchmarks or tests. Finally,\nover-regulation driven by panic of powerful AI models can, in fact, harm TAI\ntoo. Based on GitHub user-activity data, in 2023, AI open-source projects rose\nto top projects by contributor account.

    "abstract": "Events describe the state changes of entities. In a document, multiple events\nare connected by various relations (e.g., Coreference, Temporal, Causal, and\nSubevent). Therefore, obtaining the connections between events through\nEvent-Event Relation Extraction (ERE) is critical to understand natural\nlanguage. There are two main problems in the current ERE works: a. Only\nembeddings of the event triggers are used for event feature representation,\nignoring event arguments (e.g., time, place, person, etc.) and their structure\nwithin the event. b. The interconnection between relations (e.g., temporal and\ncausal relations usually interact with each other ) is ignored. To solve the\nabove problems, this paper proposes a jointly multiple ERE framework called\nGraphERE based on Graph-enhanced Event Embeddings. First, we enrich the event\nembeddings with event argument and structure features by using static AMR\ngraphs and IE graphs; Then, to jointly extract multiple event relations, we use\nNode Transformer and construct Task-specific Dynamic Event Graphs for each type\nof relation. Finally, we used a multi-task learning strategy to train the whole\nframework. Experimental results on the latest MAVEN-ERE dataset validate that\nGraphERE significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analyses indicate\nthe effectiveness of the graph-enhanced event embeddings and the joint\nextraction strategy.",

In\nthis work, we first demonstrate empirically across an extended range of\nlarge-scale tasks and architectures that LS consistently degrades SC.

This elucidates previously reported experimental results where strong\nclassifiers underperform in SC.

(1) Previous methods solely use CXR reports, which are insufficient\nfor comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially when additional\nhealth-related data like medication history and prior diagnoses are needed. (2)\nPrevious methods use raw CXR reports, which are often arbitrarily structured.\nWhile modern language models can understand various text formats, restructuring\nreports for clearer, organized anatomy-based information could enhance their\nusefulness. (3) Current evaluation methods for CXR-VQA primarily emphasize\nlinguistic correctness, lacking the capability to offer nuanced assessments of\nthe generated answers. In this work, to address the aforementioned caveats, we\nintroduce WoLF, a Wide-scope Large Language Model Framework for CXR\nunderstanding. To resolve (1), we capture multi-faceted records of patients,\nwhich are utilized for accurate diagnoses in real-world clinical scenarios.\nSpecifically, we adopt the Electronic Health Records (EHR) to generate\ninstruction-following data suited for CXR understanding.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have become an essential paradigm in\nneuroscience and artificial intelligence, providing brain-inspired computation.\nRecent advances in literature have studied the network representations of deep\nneural networks. However, there has been little work that studies\nrepresentations learned by SNNs, especially using unsupervised local learning\nmethods like spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Recent work by\n\\cite{barannikov2021representation} has introduced a novel method to compare\ntopological mappings of learned representations called Representation Topology\nDivergence (RTD). Though useful, this method is engineered particularly for\nfeedforward deep neural networks and cannot be used for recurrent networks like\nRecurrent SNNs (RSNNs).

We propose a novel reformulation of RSNNs using\nfeedforward autoencoder networks with skip connections to help us compute the\nRTD for recurrent networks. Thus, we investigate the learning capabilities of\nRSNN trained using STDP and the role of heterogeneity in the synaptic dynamics\nin learning such representations.

In this paper, we propose Non-negative\nContrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization\n(NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its\nenforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's\ncapability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not\nonly aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's\ninterpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled\nrepresentation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically,\nwe establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of\nNCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL\nsignificantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as\ndownstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily\nextended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well.\nCode is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/non_neg.",

With the rise of generative models,\nespecially diffusion models, the ability to generate realistic images close to\nthe real data distribution has been well recognized. These generated\nhigh-equality images have been successfully applied to enhance contrastive\nrepresentation learning, a technique termed ``data inflation''. However, we\nfind that the generated data (even from a good diffusion model like DDPM) may\nsometimes even harm contrastive learning. We investigate the causes behind this\nfailure from the perspective of both data inflation and data augmentation. For\nthe first time, we reveal the complementary roles that stronger data inflation\nshould be accompanied by weaker augmentations, and vice versa.

Drawing from these insights, we\npropose Adaptive Inflation (AdaInf), a purely data-centric strategy without\nintroducing any extra computation cost. On benchmark datasets, AdaInf can bring\nsignificant improvements for various contrastive learning methods.

In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been\nproposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals\nof the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic\nfeatures that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective\nState Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a\nsystem, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution\nacross temporal dimension.

While the advancement of learning from offline\nexpert data in sequential decision-making has been witnessed in various\ndomains, how to rally-wise imitate the behaviors of human players from offline\nbadminton matches has remained underexplored. Replicating opponents' behavior\nbenefits players by allowing them to undergo strategic development with\ndirection before matches. However, directly applying existing methods suffers\nfrom the inherent hierarchy of the match and the compounding effect due to the\nturn-based nature of players alternatively taking actions.

(ii) RallyNet leverages the experience to generate context as\nthe agent's intent in the rally. (iii) To generate more realistic behavior,\nRallyNet leverages Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to model the interactions\nbetween players by introducing a valuable inductive bias for learning player\nbehaviors.

Moreover, the proposed model significantly outperformed\nprevious work and other comparative models in the tasks of poems' sentiment\nanalysis, achieving an accuracy of 78.95\\%, and poetry meter classification\n(99.03\\% accuracy), while significantly expanding the scope of these two\nproblems. The dataset used in this study, contains more than 2.09 million\nverses collected from online sources, each associated with various attributes\nsuch as meter, sub-meter, poet, rhyme, and topic. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed model in understanding and analyzing Arabic\npoetry, achieving state-of-the-art results in several tasks and outperforming\nprevious works and other language models included in the study.

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal learning plays a crucial role in mobile computing techniques\nto empower smart cites. While existing research has made great efforts to\nachieve accurate predictions on the overall dataset, they still neglect the\nsignificant performance heterogeneity across samples. In this work, we\ndesignate the performance heterogeneity as the reason for unfair spatiotemporal\nlearning, which not only degrades the practical functions of models, but also\nbrings serious potential risks to real-world urban applications. To fix this\ngap, we propose a model-independent Fairness-aware framework for SpatioTemporal\nGraph learning (FairSTG), which inherits the idea of exploiting advantages of\nwell-learned samples to challenging ones with collaborative mix-up.\nSpecifically, FairSTG consists of a spatiotemporal feature extractor for model\ninitialization, a collaborative representation enhancement for knowledge\ntransfer between well-learned samples and challenging ones, and fairness\nobjectives for immediately suppressing sample-level performance heterogeneity.\nExperiments on four spatiotemporal datasets demonstrate that our FairSTG\nsignificantly improves the fairness quality while maintaining comparable\nforecasting accuracy. Case studies show FairSTG can counter both spatial and\ntemporal performance heterogeneity by our sample-level retrieval and\ncompensation, and our work can potentially alleviate the risks on\nspatiotemporal resource allocation for underrepresented urban regions.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and interpretable user satisfaction estimation (USE) is critical for\nunderstanding, evaluating, and continuously improving conversational systems.\nUsers express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with diverse conversational\npatterns in both general-purpose (ChatGPT and Bing Copilot) and task-oriented\n(customer service chatbot) conversational systems. Existing approaches based on\nfeaturized ML models or text embeddings fall short in extracting generalizable\npatterns and are hard to interpret. In this work, we show that LLMs can extract\ninterpretable signals of user satisfaction from their natural language\nutterances more effectively than embedding-based approaches. Moreover, an LLM\ncan be tailored for USE via an iterative prompting framework using supervision\nfrom labeled examples. The resulting method, Supervised Prompting for User\nsatisfaction Rubrics (SPUR), not only has higher accuracy but is more\ninterpretable as it scores user satisfaction via learned rubrics with a\ndetailed breakdown.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical event extraction is an information extraction task to obtain\nevents from biomedical text, whose targets include the type, the trigger, and\nthe respective arguments involved in an event. Traditional biomedical event\nextraction usually adopts a pipelined approach, which contains trigger\nidentification, argument role recognition, and finally event construction\neither using specific rules or by machine learning. In this paper, we propose\nan n-ary relation extraction method based on the BERT pre-training model to\nconstruct Binding events, in order to capture the semantic information about an\nevent's context and its participants. The experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves promising results on the GE11 and GE13 corpora of the BioNLP\nshared task with F1 scores of 63.14% and 59.40%, respectively. It demonstrates\nthat by significantly improving theperformance of Binding events, the overall\nperformance of the pipelined event extraction approach or even exceeds those of\ncurrent joint learning methods.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant\nenhancements in the performance of chatbot systems. Many researchers have\ndedicated their efforts to the development of bringing characteristics to\nchatbots. While there have been commercial products for developing role-driven\nchatbots using LLMs, it is worth noting that academic research in this area\nremains relatively scarce. Our research focuses on investigating the\nperformance of LLMs in constructing Characteristic AI Agents by simulating\nreal-life individuals across different settings. Current investigations have\nprimarily focused on act on roles with simple profiles. In response to this\nresearch gap, we create a benchmark for the characteristic AI agents task,\nincluding dataset, techniques, and evaluation metrics. A dataset called\n``Character100'' is built for this benchmark, comprising the most-visited\npeople on Wikipedia for language models to role-play. With the constructed\ndataset, we conduct comprehensive assessment of LLMs across various settings.\nIn addition, we devise a set of automatic metrics for quantitative performance\nevaluation. The experimental results underscore the potential directions for\nfurther improvement in the capabilities of LLMs in constructing characteristic\nAI agents.

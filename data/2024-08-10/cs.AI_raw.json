    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the\ndomain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning\nabilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the\ncontext lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex\ntasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value\n(KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new\nbottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen\nAttention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby\nreducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to\nexisting KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with\nthem. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we\ndemonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache\nsizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop\nin performance.

    "abstract": "Distributed sensors in the internet-of-things (IoT) generate vast amounts of\nsparse data. Analyzing this high-dimensional data and identifying relevant\npredictors pose substantial challenges, especially when data is preferred to\nremain on the device where it was collected for reasons such as data integrity,\ncommunication bandwidth, and privacy. This paper introduces a federated\nquantile regression algorithm to address these challenges. Quantile regression\nprovides a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables than\nmean regression models. However, traditional approaches face difficulties when\ndealing with nonconvex sparse penalties and the inherent non-smoothness of the\nloss function. For this purpose, we propose a federated smoothing proximal\ngradient (FSPG) algorithm that integrates a smoothing mechanism with the\nproximal gradient framework, thereby enhancing both precision and computational\nspeed. This integration adeptly handles optimization over a network of devices,\neach holding local data samples, making it particularly effective in federated\nlearning scenarios. The FSPG algorithm ensures steady progress and reliable\nconvergence in each iteration by maintaining or reducing the value of the\nobjective function. By leveraging nonconvex penalties, such as the minimax\nconcave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the\nproposed method can identify and preserve key predictors within sparse models.\nComprehensive simulations validate the robust theoretical foundations of the\nproposed algorithm and demonstrate improved estimation precision and reliable\nconvergence.",

Despite their success, current retinal foundation\nmodels are generally restricted to a single imaging modality, such as Color\nFundus Photography (CFP) or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), limiting their\nversatility. Moreover, these models may struggle to fully leverage expert\nannotations and overlook the valuable domain knowledge essential for\ndomain-specific representation learning. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce UrFound, a retinal foundation model designed to learn universal\nrepresentations from both multimodal retinal images and domain knowledge.\nUrFound is equipped with a modality-agnostic image encoder and accepts either\nCFP or OCT images as inputs. To integrate domain knowledge into representation\nlearning, we encode expert annotation in text supervision and propose a\nknowledge-guided masked modeling strategy for model pre-training. It involves\nreconstructing randomly masked patches of retinal images while predicting\nmasked text tokens conditioned on the corresponding retinal image. This\napproach aligns multimodal images and textual expert annotations within a\nunified latent space, facilitating generalizable and domain-specific\nrepresentation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that UrFound exhibits\nstrong generalization ability and data efficiency when adapting to various\ntasks in retinal image analysis.

But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle\non climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to\nthe vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We\naddress this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using\nmulti-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network\ndecomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of\ndynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US\nmetropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find\nthat vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide\nintersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety,\nand with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel\nand Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50%\nof the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of\nintersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the\ncomposition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably\nacross different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful\nstrategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of\neco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle\nelectrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant.

    "abstract": "Assembly code search is vital for reducing the burden on reverse engineers,\nallowing them to quickly identify specific functions using natural language\nwithin vast binary programs. Despite its significance, this critical task is\nimpeded by the complexities involved in building high-quality datasets. This\npaper explores training a Large Language Model (LLM) to emulate a general\ncompiler. By leveraging Ubuntu packages to compile a dataset of 20 billion\ntokens, we further continue pre-train CodeLlama as a Virtual Compiler (ViC),\ncapable of compiling any source code of any language to assembly code. This\napproach allows for virtual compilation across a wide range of programming\nlanguages without the need for a real compiler, preserving semantic equivalency\nand expanding the possibilities for assembly code dataset construction.\nFurthermore, we use ViC to construct a sufficiently large dataset for assembly\ncode search. Employing this extensive dataset, we achieve a substantial\nimprovement in assembly code search performance, with our model surpassing the\nleading baseline by 26%.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potentially harmful biases that\nreinforce culturally inherent stereotypes, cloud moral judgments, or amplify\npositive evaluations of majority groups. Previous explanations mainly\nattributed bias in LLMs to human annotators and the selection of training data.\nConsequently, they have typically been addressed with bottom-up approaches such\nas reinforcement learning or debiasing corpora. However, these methods only\ntreat the effects of LLM biases by indirectly influencing the model\narchitecture, but do not address the underlying causes in the computational\nprocess. Here, we propose metacognitive myopia as a cognitive-ecological\nframework that can account for a conglomerate of established and emerging LLM\nbiases and provide a lever to address problems in powerful but vulnerable\ntools. Our theoretical framework posits that a lack of the two components of\nmetacognition, monitoring and control, causes five symptoms of metacognitive\nmyopia in LLMs: integration of invalid tokens and embeddings, susceptibility to\nredundant information, neglect of base rates in conditional computation,\ndecision rules based on frequency, and inappropriate higher-order statistical\ninference for nested data structures. As a result, LLMs produce erroneous\noutput that reaches into the daily high-stakes decisions of humans. By\nintroducing metacognitive regulatory processes into LLMs, engineers and\nscientists can develop precise remedies for the underlying causes of these\nbiases. Our theory sheds new light on flawed human-machine interactions and\nraises ethical concerns regarding the increasing, imprudent implementation of\nLLMs in organizational structures.",

Although some works explore\nsimilarity-based strategies to address such noise, they suffer from sub-optimal\nsimilarity predictions influenced by modality-exclusive information (MEI),\ne.g., background noise in images and abstract definitions in texts. This issue\narises as MEI is not shared across modalities, thus aligning it in training can\nmarkedly mislead similarity predictions.

Inspired by the robustness of\ninformation bottlenecks against noise, we introduce DisNCL, a novel\ninformation-theoretic framework for feature Disentanglement in Noisy\nCorrespondence Learning, to adaptively balance the extraction of MII and MEI\nwith certifiable optimal cross-modal disentanglement efficacy. DisNCL then\nenhances similarity predictions in modality-invariant subspace, thereby greatly\nboosting similarity-based alleviation strategy for noisy correspondences.\nFurthermore, DisNCL introduces soft matching targets to model noisy\nmany-to-many relationships inherent in multi-modal input for noise-robust and\naccurate cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments confirm DisNCL's efficacy\nby 2% average recall improvement.

Specifically, we\nperturb selected point clouds with non-target categories in both shape-wise and\npoint-wise manners before inserting trigger patterns without changing their\nlabels. The features of perturbed samples are similar to those of benign\nsamples from the target class. As such, models trained on the watermarked\ndataset will have a distinctive yet stealthy backdoor behavior, i.e.,\nmisclassifying samples from the target class whenever triggers appear, since\nthe trained DNNs will treat the inserted trigger pattern as a signal to deny\npredicting the target label.

Nevertheless, there\nis a lack of simulation infrastructure capable of accurately modeling versatile\nhardware-software behaviors in LLM serving systems without extensively\nextending the simulation time. This paper aims to develop an effective\nsimulation tool, called LLMServingSim, to support future research in LLM\nserving systems. In designing LLMServingSim, we focus on two limitations of\nexisting simulators: (1) they lack consideration of the dynamic workload\nvariations of LLM inference serving due to its autoregressive nature, and (2)\nthey incur repetitive simulations without leveraging algorithmic redundancies\nin LLMs. To address these limitations, LLMServingSim simulates the LLM serving\nin the granularity of iterations, leveraging the computation redundancies\nacross decoder blocks and reusing the simulation results from previous\niterations. Additionally, LLMServingSim provides a flexible framework that\nallows users to plug in any accelerator compiler-and-simulation stacks for\nexploring various system designs with heterogeneous processors. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LLMServingSim produces simulation results closely following\nthe performance behaviors of real GPU-based LLM serving system with less than\n14.7% error rate, while offering 91.5x faster simulation speed compared to\nexisting accelerator simulators.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) are attracting\nincreasing interest due to their improving performance and applications across\nvarious domains and tasks. However, LLMs and VLMs can produce erroneous\nresults, especially when a deep understanding of the problem domain is\nrequired. For instance, when planning and perception are needed simultaneously,\nthese models often struggle because of difficulties in merging multi-modal\ninformation. To address this issue, fine-tuned models are typically employed\nand trained on specialized data structures representing the environment. This\napproach has limited effectiveness, as it can overly complicate the context for\nprocessing. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent architecture for embodied\ntask planning that operates without the need for specific data structures as\ninput. Instead, it uses a single image of the environment, handling free-form\ndomains by leveraging commonsense knowledge. We also introduce a novel, fully\nautomatic evaluation procedure, PG2S, designed to better assess the quality of\na plan. We validated our approach using the widely recognized ALFRED dataset,\ncomparing PG2S to the existing KAS metric to further evaluate the quality of\nthe generated plans.",

    "abstract": "Image generation using generative artificial intelligence has become a\npopular activity. However, text-to-image generation - where images are produced\nfrom typed prompts - can be less engaging in public settings since the act of\ntyping tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its\nsuitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we\nexplore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of\ninstallations at public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with\ngenerative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image\ngeneration with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this\nconcept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to\ntransform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at\nan event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our\nsemi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body\nprompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience to the\ninstallation's visitors. We present insights into participants' experience of\nbody prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of\nembodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual\ninteraction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to\ndesign interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public\nevent spaces.",

Drawing inspiration from the intriguing human ability to\nqualitatively visualize and describe dynamic events from past experiences\nwithout explicitly engaging in mathematical computations, this paper\ninvestigates the application of recent transformer architectures as a\nneuro-animator model.

    "abstract": "Audio-driven talking face video generation has attracted increasing attention\ndue to its huge industrial potential. Some previous methods focus on learning a\ndirect mapping from audio to visual content. Despite progress, they often\nstruggle with the ambiguity of the mapping process, leading to flawed results.\nAn alternative strategy involves facial structural representations (e.g.,\nfacial landmarks) as intermediaries. This multi-stage approach better preserves\nthe appearance details but suffers from error accumulation due to the\nindependent optimization of different stages. Moreover, most previous methods\nrely on generative adversarial networks, prone to training instability and mode\ncollapse. To address these challenges, our study proposes a novel\nlandmark-based diffusion model for talking face generation, which leverages\nfacial landmarks as intermediate representations while enabling end-to-end\noptimization. Specifically, we first establish the less ambiguous mapping from\naudio to landmark motion of lip and jaw. Then, we introduce an innovative\nconditioning module called TalkFormer to align the synthesized motion with the\nmotion represented by landmarks via differentiable cross-attention, which\nenables end-to-end optimization for improved lip synchronization. Besides,\nTalkFormer employs implicit feature warping to align the reference image\nfeatures with the target motion for preserving more appearance details.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can synthesize\nhigh-fidelity and lip-synced talking face videos, preserving more subject\nappearance details from the reference image.",

Individuals exhibit distinct\nlip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking\nstyles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync.\nEarlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized\nspeaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general\nstyles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary\naudio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not\npreserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation.\nThis work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that\neffectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio\nfrom style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip\nsync.

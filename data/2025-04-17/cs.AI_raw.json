    "abstract": "This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the\nvariables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary\nmotivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers\nwhen solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with\nnon-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to\nanalyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems\nquantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated\nby Minorminer, an algorithm provided by D-Wave and widely recognized as the\nstandard minor-embedding technique in the literature. Regarding the first\nobjective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain\nlength of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This\nunderscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing\nperformance. For the second objective, we focus on the Minorminer technique,\nassessing its capacity to embed problems, the quality of the embeddings\nproduced, and the robustness of the results. We also compare its performance\nwith Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is\ndeterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum\nannealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate\nthat there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, as it has not\nconsistently outperformed the worst-case scenario.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the market for AI models in which firms compete to\nprovide accurate model predictions and consumers exhibit heterogeneous\npreferences for model accuracy. We develop a consumer-firm duopoly model to\nanalyze how competition affects firms' incentives to improve model accuracy.\nEach firm aims to minimize its model's error, but this choice can often be\nsuboptimal. Counterintuitively, we find that in a competitive market, firms\nthat improve overall accuracy do not necessarily improve their profits. Rather,\neach firm's optimal decision is to invest further on the error dimension where\nit has a competitive advantage. By decomposing model errors into false positive\nand false negative rates, firms can reduce errors in each dimension through\ninvestments. Firms are strictly better off investing on their superior\ndimension and strictly worse off with investments on their inferior dimension.\nProfitable investments adversely affect consumers but increase overall welfare.",

Our\nmethod is motivated by a simple experiment in which we find training a\ndiscriminator using the offline dataset plus an additional expert dataset and\nthen performing discriminator-weighted behavior cloning gives strong results on\nvarious types of datasets. That optimal discriminator weight is quite similar\nto the learned visitation distribution ratio in Dual-RL, however, we find that\ncurrent Dual-RL methods do not correctly estimate that ratio. In IDRL, we\npropose a correction method to iteratively approach the optimal visitation\ndistribution ratio in the offline dataset given no addtional expert dataset.\nDuring each iteration, IDRL removes zero-weight suboptimal transitions using\nthe learned ratio from the previous iteration and runs Dual-RL on the remaining\nsubdataset. This can be seen as replacing the behavior visitation distribution\nwith the optimized visitation distribution from the previous iteration, which\ntheoretically gives a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios\nthat are closer to the optimal discriminator weight.

To improve efficiency, convolutional\noperators have been utilized to facilitate weight sharing and local\nconnections, yet they are constrained by limited receptive fields. In this\npaper, we introduce Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) Factorization, a novel\nneural network operator that implements tensor summation at multiple scales,\nwhere each tensor to be summed is obtained through Tucker-decomposition-like\nmode products. Unlike other tensor decomposition methods in the literature, MTS\nis not introduced as a network compression tool; instead, as a new backbone\nneural layer. MTS not only reduces the number of parameters required while\nenhancing the efficiency of weight optimization compared to traditional dense\nlayers (i.e., unfactorized weight matrices in MLP layers), but it also\ndemonstrates clear advantages over convolutional layers. The proof-of-concept\nexperimental comparison of the proposed MTS networks with MLPs and\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrates their effectiveness across\nvarious tasks, such as classification, compression, and signal restoration.\nAdditionally, when integrated with modern non-linear units such as the\nmulti-head gate (MHG), also introduced in this study, the corresponding neural\nnetwork, MTSNet, demonstrates a more favorable complexity-performance tradeoff\ncompared to state-of-the-art transformers in various computer vision\napplications.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of AI systems in the economy hinges on their ability\nto generate economic value that outweighs their inference costs. Evaluating\nthis tradeoff requires metrics that account for both performance and costs. We\npropose a framework grounded in production theory for evaluating language\nmodels by combining accuracy and inference cost. We introduce \"cost-of-pass\",\nthe expected monetary cost of generating a correct solution. We then define the\n\"frontier cost-of-pass\" as the minimum cost-of-pass achievable across available\nmodels or the \"human-expert, using the approximate cost of hiring an expert.\nOur analysis reveals distinct economic insights. First, lightweight models are\nmost cost-effective for basic quantitative tasks, large models for\nknowledge-intensive ones, and reasoning models for complex quantitative\nproblems, despite higher per-token costs. Second, tracking this frontier\ncost-of-pass over the past year reveals significant progress, particularly for\ncomplex quantitative tasks where the cost has roughly halved every few months.\nThird, to trace key innovations driving this progress, we examine\ncounterfactual frontiers: estimates of cost-efficiency without specific model\nclasses. We find that innovations in lightweight, large, and reasoning models\nhave been essential for pushing the frontier in basic quantitative,\nknowledge-intensive, and complex quantitative tasks, respectively. Finally, we\nassess the cost-reductions afforded by common inference-time techniques like\nmajority voting and self-refinement, finding that their marginal accuracy gains\nrarely justify their costs. Our findings underscore that complementary\nmodel-level innovations are the primary drivers of cost-efficiency, and our\neconomic framework provides a principled tool for measuring this progress and\nguiding deployment.",

Damage to menisci can lead to onset and\nprogression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of\ndisability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated\nsegmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of\nmeniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci\nplay in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of\nconvolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large\nvision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a\nso-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a\nrange of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the\nmodel. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation\nof menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained\nas a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was\nunable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\\pm0.03$,\ncompared to $0.87\\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set.

Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both\nconfigurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus\nmorphology.

    "abstract": "Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery\nholds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster\nresponse. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of\nannotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object\ndetection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in\nsatellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of\nthe technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise.\nFurthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of\nsupervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we\nintroduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based\nSAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an\nunlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\\textsuperscript{2}\nground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach\ncapitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate\nobjects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from\nthe background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the\ndisproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive\nsampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution\nduring training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach\nallows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3\nor UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such\nas DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark\nSAR datasets.",

To bridge this gap, we adopted the\nInterpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) as an analytic lens to analyze 59,607\nposts from Reddit's r/SuicideWatch, categorizing them into SI dimensions\n(Loneliness, Lack of Reciprocal Love, Self Hate, and Liability) and risk\nfactors (Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Acquired\nCapability of Suicide). We found that high-risk SI posts express planning and\nattempts, methods and tools, and weaknesses and pain. In addition, we also\nexamined the language of supportive responses through psycholinguistic and\ncontent analyses to find that individuals respond differently to different\nstages of Suicidal Ideation (SI) posts. Finally, we explored the role of AI\nchatbots in providing effective supportive responses to suicidal ideation\nposts.

This disconnect between\ncausal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain\nexperts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal\nresearchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods.\nTo address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that\noperationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model\nframework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for\nboth tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal\ninference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result\ninterpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive\nrefinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists\nwhile preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art\ncausal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding\naccess to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich,\nreal-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance\ncompared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible\nsolution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world\napplicability in causal analysis.

Findings: Smaller-scale models can\nsucceed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance\ntasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show\nbetter resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy\nimprovement.

    "abstract": "How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real\nimprovements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we\npropose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models.\nMIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal\npathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit\nlocalization track compares methods that locate the model components - and\nconnections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,\nattribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable\nlocalization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate\nmodel features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find\nthat attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit\nlocalization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS\nmethod performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,\nstandard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB\nenables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that\nthere has been real progress in the field.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential as agents,\nexcelling at tasks that require multiple rounds of reasoning and interactions.\nRejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as an effective method for\nfinetuning LLMs as agents: it first imitates expert-generated successful\ntrajectories and further improves agentic skills through iterative fine-tuning\non successful, self-generated trajectories. However, since the expert (e.g.,\nGPT-4) succeeds primarily on simpler subtasks and RFT inherently favors simpler\nscenarios, many complex subtasks remain unsolved and persistently\nout-of-distribution (OOD). Upon investigating these challenging subtasks, we\ndiscovered that previously failed expert trajectories can often provide\nvaluable guidance, e.g., plans and key actions, that can significantly improve\nagent exploration efficiency and acquisition of critical skills. Motivated by\nthese observations, we propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which\nidentifies beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories and integrates\nthem into the training dataset. Potentially harmful actions are meticulously\nexcluded to prevent contamination of the model learning process. By leveraging\nthe beneficial actions in expert failures, EEF successfully solves some\npreviously unsolvable subtasks and improves agent tuning performance.\nRemarkably, our approach achieved a 62\\% win rate in WebShop, outperforming RFT\n(53. 6\\%) and GPT-4 (35. 6\\%), and to the best of our knowledge, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and\nexceed 81 in SciWorld.",

Additionally, we introduce a suite of\nmetrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a\nVLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our\nbenchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly\nunderperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the\nperformance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased\ninstructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key\nelements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality;\n3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed\nin a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple\nmetrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for\nboth direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe\na ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model\ntraining, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly\nsynthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon\nthat intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.",

Imposing such constraints can be naturally\nframed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting\ndistribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution\n-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for\ncontrolled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC\nframework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific\nconstraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational\nresources in light of new information during the course of generation. By\ncomparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains\n-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and\nmolecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach\nallows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,\nas well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic\nperspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better\napproximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework\nof Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic\nprogramming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a\nbroad variety of controlled generation problems.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has\nexperienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement\nof textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training\nparadigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality\nimage-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the\navailability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce\nand saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.\nThis study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for\nvision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale\nlow-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a\nviable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)\nachieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language\nmodels through empirical validation. This paper presents following key\ncontributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,\nlow-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO\nmethodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,\nthe non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.3%\nto 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals\nthat our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their\ncounterparts. Across 15 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data\nachieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to identical\nimages with alt-text. In 20 common cognitive domains, the model trained with\nour data outperforms the alt-text data by at least 7.5%. Meanwhile, it also\noffers considerable support in the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the\nFID score is reduced by 17.1 on a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on\nthe MSCOCO validation benchmark.",

Recent advances in Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) like GPT-4V and DALLE-3 have sparked debate about whether their\noutputs reflect combinational creativity--defined by M. A. Boden (1998) as\nsynthesizing novel ideas through combining existing concepts--or sophisticated\npattern matching of training data. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science,\nwe investigate the combinational creativity of VLMs from the lens of concept\nblending. We propose the Identification-Explanation-Implication (IEI)\nframework, which decomposes creative processes into three levels: identifying\ninput spaces, extracting shared attributes, and deriving novel semantic\nimplications. To validate this framework, we curate CreativeMashup, a\nhigh-quality dataset of 666 artist-generated visual mashups annotated according\nto the IEI framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in\ncomprehension tasks, best VLMs have surpassed average human performance while\nfalling short of expert-level understanding; in generation tasks, incorporating\nour IEI framework into the generation pipeline significantly enhances the\ncreative quality of VLMs' outputs.

The\ndevelopment of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces\nchallenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex\nenvironmental interference.

However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous\nuser queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources\nwhile also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant\ndocuments. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in\nisolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or\nrobustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors\nsimultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and\nMisinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and\nrealistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including\nambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent\napproach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple\nrounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to\ndisambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby\nhandling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which\nrequires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over\nstrong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires\nsuppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with\nLlama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for\nexisting RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match\nscore).

Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,\nand lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and\ndisease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand\ncardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an\nindividual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly\nexploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have\nbegun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data\nand focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a\ncomprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a\ncomprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of\nindividual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,\nViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling\na complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with\ndetailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This\nmulti-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including\ncardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and\nclassification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified\nframework.

    "abstract": "In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and\nefficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced\nin partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse\ncontext representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances\naccuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this\ndichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse\ncontexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce\nseveral strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within\nthe prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the\nprototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes\nsearchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we\nimplement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal\nreconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared\nspace, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts\nduring encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide\nweak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual\nrepresentations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and\nQVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing\nefficiency.",

Existing methods typically rely on a\nthought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these\napproaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex\ntasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by\nleveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In\nthis paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability)\nin applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution\nwithin a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these\nchallenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths\n(sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to\nexpand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to\nimprove task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained\nend-to-end to optimize overall planning performance.

Coreset selection\naddresses these challenges by identifying and retaining the most informative\nsamples, constructing a compact subset for target domain training. However,\ncurrent methods primarily rely on instance-level difficulty assessments,\noverlooking crucial category-level characteristics and consequently\nunder-representing minority classes. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nNon-Uniform Class-Wise Coreset Selection (NUCS), a novel framework that\nintegrates both class-level and instance-level criteria. NUCS automatically\nallocates data selection budgets for each class based on intrinsic category\ndifficulty and adaptively selects samples within optimal difficulty ranges.

Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates the rationale behind\nadaptive budget allocation and sample selection, while extensive experiments\nacross 14 diverse datasets and model architectures demonstrate NUCS's\nconsistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior\naccuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, on CIFAR100 and Food101, NUCS\nmatches full-data training accuracy while retaining just 30% of samples and\nreducing computation time by 60%.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin\nHeidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)\nand Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively\ncomplete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs\nand an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are\nbridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze\nuser queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT\nspecialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide\nactionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited\nto categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological\nexistential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query\nprocessing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as\nmetaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves\nformalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's\nFundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of\nbeings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way\nfor a universal query analysis tool.

Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction\ntagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter\nvalue-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction\nmechanism to filter non-conflicting values.We conduct extensive experiments on\nvarious LLMs across countries, and the results provide insights into assisting\nin the identification of misaligned scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate that\nNaVAB can be combined with alignment techniques to effectively reduce value\nconcerns by aligning LLMs' values with the target country.",

To address these challenges, we explore the\ncombination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an\ninformation gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (IGCIDB) framework.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents\nas a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in\nmachine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and\nanalyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on\nhow they could enhance multilingual digital communication.

To demonstrate\nthe feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study\nin legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized\nAI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and\n(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the\npotential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual\nawareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in\nvarious vision tasks.

In\ncontrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored,\nlimiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address\nthis gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS,\nbased on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates\nrealistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane,\nsampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the\npoint cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization\nexperiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale,\nperturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the\ngenerated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from\npronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our\ncross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet\ngeometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to\ntheir specific surface characteristics.

    "abstract": "Generating multi-subject stylized images remains a significant challenge due\nto the ambiguity in defining style attributes (e.g., color, texture,\natmosphere, and structure) and the difficulty in consistently applying them\nacross multiple subjects. Although recent diffusion-based text-to-image models\nhave achieved remarkable progress, existing methods typically rely on\ncomputationally expensive inversion procedures or large-scale stylized\ndatasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle with maintaining multi-subject\nsemantic fidelity and are limited by high inference costs. To address these\nlimitations, we propose ICAS (IP-Adapter and ControlNet-based Attention\nStructure), a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject\nstyle transfer. Instead of full-model tuning, ICAS adaptively fine-tunes only\nthe content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, thereby\npreserving identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability.\nBy combining IP-Adapter for adaptive style injection with ControlNet for\nstructural conditioning, our framework ensures faithful global layout\npreservation alongside accurate local style synthesis. Furthermore, ICAS\nintroduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism, which enables\neffective style transfer under limited-data settings without the need for\nextensive stylized corpora.

However, their typical use is for evaluating\npotential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be\ninverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization\napproaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and\ncomprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting\nclimate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address\nthese limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate\nsimulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,\nincluding reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state\nspaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.\nAdditionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions\ninterpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation\nfor more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important\nlimitations and areas for future research.",

In this paper, we propose GeoGen, a\npipeline that can automatically generates step-wise reasoning paths for\ngeometry diagrams. By leveraging the precise symbolic reasoning,\n\\textbf{GeoGen} produces large-scale, high-quality question-answer pairs.

Experimental\nresults show that our approach consistently improves the performance of MLLMs,\nachieving remarkable results on benchmarks for geometric reasoning tasks.

At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the\nmajor bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be\neffectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However,\nexisting multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying\nglobal features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized\ncharacteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This\nglobal-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific\ndiscriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and\nPersonalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly\nidentifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively\nsupplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features\nusing a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining\nstrong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights\ninto the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby\ndemonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature\nselection approaches.",

While CLIP demonstrates\nremarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature\nspaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text\nfeature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing\nworks attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or\nfine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or\ndegradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a\npost-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and\nfine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training\non small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To\nthis end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and\nhybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features\nto follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random\nreference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid\nsoft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and\noutputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both\nmaintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.\nOur extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show\nthat CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the\nzero-shot performance.",

    "abstract": "Local optima networks (LONs) capture fitness landscape information. They are\ntypically constructed in a black-box manner; information about the problem\nstructure is not utilised. This also applies to the analysis of LONs: knowledge\nabout the problem, such as interaction between variables, is not considered. We\nchallenge this status-quo with an alternative approach: we consider how LON\nanalysis can be improved by incorporating subfunction-based information - this\ncan either be known a-priori or learned during search. To this end, LONs are\nconstructed for several benchmark pseudo-boolean problems using three\napproaches: firstly, the standard algorithm; a second algorithm which uses\ndeterministic grey-box crossover; and a third algorithm which selects\nperturbations based on learned information about variable interactions. Metrics\nrelated to subfunction changes in a LON are proposed and compared with metrics\nfrom previous literature which capture other aspects of a LON. Incorporating\nproblem structure in LON construction and analysing it can bring enriched\ninsight into optimisation dynamics. Such information may be crucial to\nunderstanding the difficulty of solving a given problem with state-of-the-art\nlinkage learning optimisers. In light of the results, we suggest incorporation\nof problem structure as an alternative paradigm in landscape analysis for\nproblems with known or suspected subfunction structure.",

    "abstract": "Incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously acquire knowledge\nfrom evolving data streams while preserving previously learned capabilities.\nWhile current research predominantly focuses on unimodal incremental learning\nand multimodal incremental learning where the modalities are consistent,\nreal-world scenarios often present data from entirely new modalities, posing\nadditional challenges. This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a\nunified model capable of incremental learning across continuously evolving\nmodal sequences. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm called Modality\nIncremental Learning (MIL), where each learning stage involves data from\ndistinct modalities. To address this task, we propose a novel framework named\nHarmony, designed to achieve modal alignment and knowledge retention, enabling\nthe model to reduce the modal discrepancy and learn from a sequence of distinct\nmodalities, ultimately completing tasks across multiple modalities within a\nunified framework. Our approach introduces the adaptive compatible feature\nmodulation and cumulative modal bridging. Through constructing historical modal\nfeatures and performing modal knowledge accumulation and alignment, the\nproposed components collaboratively bridge modal differences and maintain\nknowledge retention, even with solely unimodal data available at each learning\nphase.These components work in concert to establish effective modality\nconnections and maintain knowledge retention, even when only unimodal data is\navailable at each learning stage. Extensive experiments on the MIL task\ndemonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing\nincremental learning methods, validating its effectiveness in MIL scenarios.",

This behavior indicates that\nabstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential\nfor the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion\noccurs.

Despite its benefits, MoE is still too expensive to\ndeploy on resource-constrained edge devices, especially with the demands of\non-device inference services. Recent research efforts often apply model\ncompression techniques, such as quantization, pruning and merging, to restrict\nMoE complexity. Unfortunately, due to their predefined static model\noptimization strategies, they cannot always achieve the desired\nquality-overhead trade-off when handling multiple requests, finally degrading\nthe on-device quality of service. These limitations motivate us to propose the\nD$^2$MoE, an algorithm-system co-design framework that matches diverse task\nrequirements by dynamically allocating the most proper bit-width to each\nexpert. Specifically, inspired by the nested structure of matryoshka dolls, we\npropose the matryoshka weight quantization (MWQ) to progressively compress\nexpert weights in a bit-nested manner and reduce the required runtime memory.\nOn top of it, we further optimize the I/O-computation pipeline and design a\nheuristic scheduling algorithm following our hottest-expert-bit-first (HEBF)\nprinciple, which maximizes the expert parallelism between I/O and computation\nqueue under constrained memory budgets, thus significantly reducing the idle\ntemporal bubbles waiting for the experts to load.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for\nautonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might\nhave severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks\nthat can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly\nclassified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In\nthis study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning\n(HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate\nrobustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding\nthem into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and\nvgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our\nHCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack\n(FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted\nadversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during\nadversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain\naccuracy above 95\\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\\% for GA and FGSA\nattacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our\nalexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\\% compared to C-DL\nmodels that achieved accuracies below 21\\%. Our results highlight that the\nHCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under\nadversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.",

One\nsignificant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to\ngenerate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced\nreadability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to\ninvestigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art\ncode LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both\nquantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive\nand manifests at various granularities and extents, including character,\nstatement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition\npatterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique\ndesigned to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep\nusing both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results\ndemonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing\nrepetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3,\nrep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1\nincrease of 208.3% over greedy search).

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Robo-SGG, i.e.,\nLayout-Oriented Normalization and Restitution for Robust Scene Graph\nGeneration. Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph\ngeneration aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,\nwith the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted\nimages. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to\ncompromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To\nobtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is\ndomain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted\nimages. Specifically, we employ Instance Normalization(IN) to filter out the\ndomain-specific feature and recover the unchangeable structural features, i.e.,\nthe positional and semantic relationships among objects by the proposed\nLayout-Oriented Restitution. Additionally, we propose a Layout-Embedded Encoder\n(LEE) that augments the existing object and predicate encoders within the SGG\nframework, enriching the robust positional and semantic features of objects and\npredicates. Note that our proposed Robo-SGG module is designed as a\nplug-and-play component, which can be easily integrated into any baseline SGG\nmodel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating the\nstate-of-the-art method into our proposed Robo-SGG, we achieve relative\nimprovements of 5.6%, 8.0%, and 6.5% in mR@50 for PredCls, SGCls, and SGDet\ntasks on the VG-C dataset, respectively, and achieve new state-of-the-art\nperformance in corruption scene graph generation benchmark (VG-C and GQA-C).

In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,\nLLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,\nand we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this\ninformation to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting\nthe language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic\nimprovements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability\ntechniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to\nwhich that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is\npossible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate\nwith the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of\nthese layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high\nperformance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information\nrequired to produce a correct response is contained within the representations\nof the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning\nis significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error\nafter finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest\nthat it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent\nto which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially\nincreasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons\nrelated to the prior probability of token sequences.",

Therefore, the confidence\nintervals provided could be invalid, especially in a changing traffic\nenvironment. To fill this gap, we propose an efficient method, CONTINA\n(Conformal Traffic Intervals with Adaptation) to provide interval predictions\nthat can adapt to external changes. By collecting the errors of interval during\ndeployment, the method can adjust the interval in the next step by widening it\nif the errors are too large or shortening it otherwise. Furthermore, we\ntheoretically prove that the coverage of the confidence intervals provided by\nour method converges to the target coverage level. Experiments across four\nreal-world datasets and prediction models demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan provide valid confidence intervals with shorter lengths. Our method can\nhelp traffic management personnel develop a more reasonable and robust\noperation plan in practice. And we release the code, model and dataset in\n\\href{ https://github.com/xiannanhuang/CONTINA/}{ Github}.",

    "abstract": "In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align\nthe agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including\ncost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires\nanticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general\nsetting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from\nsparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety\nmodel that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact\non the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their\ncorresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory\nis safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to\ndemonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep.\nThird, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and\nderive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally,\nour empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is\neffective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various\ncontinuous control tasks.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing\nworkflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of\ncomputer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative\nevents enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However,\nprivacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection\nfrom OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR\nworkflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for\nprivacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage,\nwe leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic\nsegmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from\nconventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a\nfused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for\nOR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38\nsimulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results\nindicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves\nperformance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on\ndetecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow\nanalysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions\nand they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating\ndomain-specific appearance differences.",

    "abstract": "To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B\nfamily of models, and the \"prefix-prompting\" extraction technique, we were able\nto auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one\nentire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens.\nWe were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books,\npiece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We\nshow that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus,\nlikely duplication in the training data.\n  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama\n3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this\nundoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated\nprimarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the\nlimits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework\nfor studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in\naligned LLMs.",

    "abstract": "We formalise the notion of an anonymous public announcement in the tradition\nof public announcement logic. Such announcements can be seen as in-between a\npublic announcement from ``the outside\" (an announcement of $\\phi$) and a\npublic announcement by one of the agents (an announcement of $K_a\\phi$): we get\nmore information than just $\\phi$, but not (necessarily) about exactly who made\nit. Even if such an announcement is prima facie anonymous, depending on the\nbackground knowledge of the agents it might reveal the identity of the\nannouncer: if I post something on a message board, the information might reveal\nwho I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore, like in the Russian Cards\npuzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention was to stay anonymous, that\nin fact might reveal more information. In this paper we first look at the case\nwhen no assumption about intentions are made, in which case the logic with an\nanonymous public announcement operator is reducible to epistemic logic. We then\nlook at the case when we assume common knowledge of the intention to stay\nanonymous, which is both more complex and more interesting: in several ways it\nboils down to the notion of a ``safe\" announcement (again, similarly to Russian\nCards). Main results include formal expressivity results and axiomatic\ncompleteness for key logical languages.",

    "abstract": "Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety,\ngenerating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective\ninvestigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few\nprior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from\nthese events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented\nthe first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events\nthrough the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It\nfocuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and\ncriminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The\nNER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot\nprompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical\ninformation from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and\nsocial media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora\ndemonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER,\nachieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores.\nMeanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a\nresource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed\nthat increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the\ngains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior\nadaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.",

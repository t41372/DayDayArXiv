    "abstract": "Simulating ultra-high-granularity detector responses in Particle Physics\nrepresents a critical yet computationally demanding task. This thesis aims to\novercome this challenge for the Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD) at the Belle II\nexperiment, which features over 7.5M pixel channels-the highest spatial\nresolution detector simulation dataset ever analysed with generative models.\nThis thesis starts off by a comprehensive and taxonomic review on generative\nmodels for simulating detector signatures. Then, it presents the Intra-Event\nAware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN), a new geometry-aware generative\nmodel that introduces a relational attentive reasoning and Self-Supervised\nLearning to approximate an \"event\" in the detector. This study underscores the\nimportance of intra-event correlation for downstream physics analyses. Building\nupon this, the work drifts towards a more generic approach and presents\nYonedaVAE, a Category Theory-inspired generative model that tackles the open\nproblem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) simulation. YonedaVAE introduces a\nlearnable Yoneda embedding to capture the entirety of an event based on its\nsensor relationships, formulating a Category theoretical language for\nintra-event relational reasoning. This is complemented by introducing a\nSelf-Supervised learnable prior for VAEs and an Adaptive Top-q sampling\nmechanism, enabling the model to sample point clouds with variable\nintra-category cardinality in a zero-shot manner. Variable Intra-event\ncardinality has not been approached before and is vital for simulating\nirregular detector geometries. Trained on an early experiment data, YonedaVAE\ncan reach a reasonable OOD simulation precision of a later experiment with\nalmost double luminosity. This study introduces, for the first time, the\nresults of using deep generative models for ultra-high granularity detector\nsimulation in Particle Physics.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous parallel-style on-ramp merging in human controlled traffic\ncontinues to be an existing issue for autonomous vehicle control. Existing\nnon-learning based solutions for vehicle control rely on rules and optimization\nprimarily. These methods have been seen to present significant challenges.\nRecent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning have shown promise and have\nreceived significant academic interest however the available learning based\napproaches show inadequate attention to other highway vehicles and often rely\non inaccurate road traffic assumptions. In addition, the parallel-style case is\nrarely considered. A novel learning based model for acceleration and lane\nchange decision making that explicitly considers the utility to both the ego\nvehicle and its surrounding vehicles which may be cooperative or uncooperative\nto produce behaviour that is socially acceptable is proposed. The novel reward\nfunction makes use of Social Value Orientation to weight the vehicle's level of\nsocial cooperation and is divided into ego vehicle and surrounding vehicle\nutility which are weighted according to the model's designated Social Value\nOrientation. A two-lane highway with an on-ramp divided into a taper-style and\nparallel-style section is considered. Simulation results indicated the\nimportance of considering surrounding vehicles in reward function design and\nshow that the proposed model matches or surpasses those in literature in terms\nof collisions while also introducing socially courteous behaviour avoiding near\nmisses and anti-social behaviour through direct consideration of the effect of\nmerging on surrounding vehicles.",

Fair-ness considerations in the development\nof ML-based solutions for health have particular implications for Africa, which\nalready faces inequitable power imbalances between the Global North and\nSouth.This paper seeks to explore fairness for global health, with Africa as a\ncase study. We conduct a scoping review to propose axes of disparities for\nfairness consideration in the African context and delineate where they may come\ninto play in different ML-enabled medical modalities. We then conduct\nqualitative research studies with 672 general population study participants and\n28 experts inML, health, and policy focused on Africa to obtain corroborative\nevidence on the proposed axes of disparities. Our analysis focuses on\ncolonialism as the attribute of interest and examines the interplay between\nartificial intelligence (AI), health, and colonialism. Among the pre-identified\nattributes, we found that colonial history, country of origin, and national\nincome level were specific axes of disparities that participants believed would\ncause an AI system to be biased.However, there was also divergence of opinion\nbetween experts and general population participants. Whereas experts generally\nexpressed a shared view about the relevance of colonial history for the\ndevelopment and implementation of AI technologies in Africa, the majority of\nthe general population participants surveyed did not think there was a direct\nlink between AI and colonialism. Based on these findings, we provide practical\nrecommendations for developing fairness-aware ML solutions for health in\nAfrica.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation, the technique of transferring knowledge from large,\ncomplex models to smaller ones, marks a pivotal step towards efficient AI\ndeployment. Distilling Step-by-Step~(DSS), a novel method utilizing\nchain-of-thought~(CoT) distillation, has demonstrated promise by imbuing\nsmaller models with the superior reasoning capabilities of their larger\ncounterparts. In DSS, the distilled model acquires the ability to generate\nrationales and predict labels concurrently through a multi-task learning\nframework. However, DSS overlooks the intrinsic relationship between the two\ntraining tasks, leading to ineffective integration of CoT knowledge with the\ntask of label prediction. To this end, we investigate the mutual relationship\nof the two tasks from Information Bottleneck perspective and formulate it as\nmaximizing the mutual information of the representation features of the two\ntasks. We propose a variational approach to solve this optimization problem\nusing a learning-based method. Our experimental results across four datasets\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art DSS. Our findings\noffer insightful guidance for future research on language model distillation as\nwell as applications involving CoT.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an advanced approach for fortifying Federated Learning\n(FL) systems against label-flipping attacks. We propose a simplified\nconsensus-based verification process integrated with an adaptive thresholding\nmechanism. This dynamic thresholding is designed to adjust based on the\nevolving landscape of model updates, offering a refined layer of anomaly\ndetection that aligns with the real-time needs of distributed learning\nenvironments. Our method necessitates a majority consensus among participating\nclients to validate updates, ensuring that only vetted and consensual\nmodifications are applied to the global model. The efficacy of our approach is\nvalidated through experiments on two benchmark datasets in deep learning,\nCIFAR-10 and MNIST. Our results indicate a significant mitigation of\nlabel-flipping attacks, bolstering the FL system's resilience. This method\ntranscends conventional techniques that depend on anomaly detection or\nstatistical validation by incorporating a verification layer reminiscent of\nblockchain's participatory validation without the associated cryptographic\noverhead. The innovation of our approach rests in striking an optimal balance\nbetween heightened security measures and the inherent limitations of FL\nsystems, such as computational efficiency and data privacy.

Our architecture consists of two components: a declarative\nrule-based model for transparent classification and a neural component to\nenhance rule generalizability through semantic text matching. Notably, our\nsemantic matcher is trained in an unsupervised domain-agnostic way, solely with\nsynthetic data. Further, these components are loosely coupled, allowing for\nrule modifications without retraining the semantic matcher.

Further, we show that our approach\nremains modular and pliable, i.e., the corresponding rules can be locally\nmodified to improve the overall model. Human interventions to the rules for the\nTACRED relation \\texttt{org:parents} boost the performance on that relation by\nas much as 26\\% relative improvement, without negatively impacting the other\nrelations, and without retraining the semantic matching component.",

Firstly, it is the innovative\nparallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs\nand Martin Heidegger's concepts of \"ready-to-hand\" and \"present-at-hand,\" which\nencapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in\ninteracting with the world. This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning\nLLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding\nlight on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning. Secondly,\na structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of\ntruth as \"unconcealment\" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to\nmap out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning\ninto four distinct categories. Respective cognitive faculties are delineated,\nallowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus\nclarifying their strengths and inherent limitations. Our findings reveal that\nwhile LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo\nRational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no\ncreative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI\nmodels such as the Faculty of Judgement. The potential and risks of LLMs when\nthey are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated. The results\nindicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning\nabilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is\nyet unattained. This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but\nalso propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the\nway for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.",

Manual analysis of EEG is labor-intensive and requires\nexpertise, making automatic EEG interpretation crucial for reducing workload\nand accurately assessing seizures. In epilepsy diagnosis, prolonged EEG\nmonitoring generates extensive data, often spanning hours, days, or even weeks.\nWhile machine learning techniques for automatic EEG interpretation have\nadvanced significantly in recent decades, there remains a gap in its ability to\nefficiently analyze large datasets with a balance of accuracy and computational\nefficiency. To address the challenges mentioned above, an Attention Recurrent\nNeural Network (ARNN) is proposed that can process a large amount of data\nefficiently and accurately. This ARNN cell recurrently applies attention layers\nalong a sequence and has linear complexity with the sequence length and\nleverages parallel computation by processing multi-channel EEG signals rather\nthan single-channel signals. In this architecture, the attention layer is a\ncomputational unit that efficiently applies self-attention and cross-attention\nmechanisms to compute a recurrent function over a wide number of state vectors\nand input signals. This framework is inspired in part by the attention layer\nand long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, but it scales this typical cell up by\nseveral orders to parallelize for multi-channel EEG signals. It inherits the\nadvantages of attention layers and LSTM gate while avoiding their respective\ndrawbacks. The model's effectiveness is evaluated through extensive experiments\nwith heterogeneous datasets, including the CHB-MIT and UPenn and Mayo's Clinic\ndatasets.",

To measure these risks of malicious\nuse, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for\nhazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private,\npreventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on\nonly a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we\npublicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a\ndataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of\nhazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP\nwas developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was\nstringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public\nrelease. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge\nin LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such\nhazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a\nstate-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations.\nRMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in\nareas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a\nconcrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our\nbenchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai",

    "abstract": "The integration of learning and reasoning is high on the research agenda in\nAI. Nevertheless, there is only a little attention to use existing background\nknowledge for reasoning about partially observed scenes to answer questions\nabout the scene. Yet, we as humans use such knowledge frequently to infer\nplausible answers to visual questions (by eliminating all inconsistent ones).\nSuch knowledge often comes in the form of constraints about objects and it\ntends to be highly domain or environment-specific. We contribute a novel\nbenchmark called CLEVR-POC for reasoning-intensive visual question answering\n(VQA) in partially observable environments under constraints. In CLEVR-POC,\nknowledge in the form of logical constraints needs to be leveraged to generate\nplausible answers to questions about a hidden object in a given partial scene.\nFor instance, if one has the knowledge that all cups are colored either red,\ngreen or blue and that there is only one green cup, it becomes possible to\ndeduce the color of an occluded cup as either red or blue, provided that all\nother cups, including the green one, are observed. Through experiments, we\nobserve that the low performance of pre-trained vision language models like\nCLIP (~ 22%) and a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 (~ 46%) on CLEVR-POC\nascertains the necessity for frameworks that can handle reasoning-intensive\ntasks where environment-specific background knowledge is available and crucial.\nFurthermore, our demonstration illustrates that a neuro-symbolic model, which\nintegrates an LLM like GPT-4 with a visual perception network and a formal\nlogical reasoner, exhibits exceptional performance on CLEVR-POC.",

We introduce\nCradle, a modular and flexible LMM-powered framework, as a preliminary attempt\ntowards GCC. Enhanced by six key modules, Cradle can understand input\nscreenshots and output executable code for low-level keyboard and mouse control\nafter high-level planning, so that Cradle can interact with any software and\ncomplete long-horizon complex tasks without relying on any built-in APIs.\nExperimental results show that Cradle exhibits remarkable generalizability and\nimpressive performance across four previously unexplored commercial video\ngames, five software applications, and a comprehensive benchmark, OSWorld.\nCradle is the first to enable foundation agents to follow the main storyline\nand complete 40-minute-long real missions in the complex AAA game Red Dead\nRedemption 2 (RDR2).

However, optimizing proxy\nrewards frequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function\nceases to be a good proxy and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect\nto the unspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have\nbeen impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this\ngap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation\nbetween proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a \"reference\npolicy\" that breaks down under optimization. We show that this definition\ncaptures reward hacking behavior across several realistic settings, including\nin reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Using our formulation, we\nshow theoretically that regularization to the reference policy can effectively\nprevent reward hacking. While the current practice in RLHF applies a KL penalty\nbetween action distributions for this purpose, our theory suggests regularizing\nthe $\\chi^2$ divergence between the policies' occupancy measures can be more\neffective. We intuitively show the benefits of this type of regularization and\ndemonstrate that it better mitigates reward hacking in practice across four\nrealistic settings, including RLHF.

    "abstract": "Generative modeling of complex behaviors from labeled datasets has been a\nlongstanding problem in decision making. Unlike language or image generation,\ndecision making requires modeling actions - continuous-valued vectors that are\nmultimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources,\nwhere generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class\nof models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing\nactions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means\nstruggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and\nlacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range\nactions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer\n(VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal\naction prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT\naugments BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector\nquantization module. Across seven environments including simulated\nmanipulation, autonomous driving, and robotics, VQ-BeT improves on\nstate-of-the-art models such as BeT and Diffusion Policies. Importantly, we\ndemonstrate VQ-BeT's improved ability to capture behavior modes while\naccelerating inference speed 5x over Diffusion Policies.

Central to our approach is a compact\npoint-based representation of affordance, which bridges the VLM's predictions\non observed images and the robot's actions in the physical world. By prompting\nthe pre-trained VLM, our approach utilizes the VLM's commonsense knowledge and\nconcept understanding acquired from broad data sources to predict affordances\nand generate motions. To facilitate the VLM's reasoning in zero-shot and\nfew-shot manners, we propose a visual prompting technique that annotates marks\non images, converting affordance reasoning into a series of visual\nquestion-answering problems that are solvable by the VLM. We further explore\nmethods to enhance performance with robot experiences collected by MOKA through\nin-context learning and policy distillation.

    "abstract": "Reaching consensus is key to multi-agent coordination. To accomplish a\ncooperative task, agents need to coherently select optimal joint actions to\nmaximize the team reward. However, current cooperative multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) methods usually do not explicitly take consensus\ninto consideration, which may cause miscoordination problem. In this paper, we\npropose a model-based consensus mechanism to explicitly coordinate multiple\nagents. The proposed Multi-agent Goal Imagination (MAGI) framework guides\nagents to reach consensus with an Imagined common goal. The common goal is an\nachievable state with high value, which is obtained by sampling from the\ndistribution of future states. We directly model this distribution with a\nself-supervised generative model, thus alleviating the \"curse of dimensinality\"\nproblem induced by multi-agent multi-step policy rollout commonly used in\nmodel-based methods. We show that such efficient consensus mechanism can guide\nall agents cooperatively reaching valuable future states. Results on\nMulti-agent Particle-Environments and Google Research Football environment\ndemonstrate the superiority of MAGI in both sample efficiency and performance.",

    "abstract": "Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks.\nOut-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with\nfalse text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences.\nCurrent methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing\nexplanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking\nmisinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich\nknowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation\ngeneration, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the\nsubtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel\nmultimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation\ndetection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on\nInstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic\nobjects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only\nGPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's\ndiscriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not\nonly detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external\nknowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER\nsurpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in detection accuracy.

We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics:\nthe Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving\napproximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry\nout the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that\nbreak down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders\nfor problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing\nthe calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating\nthat, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final\nHartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases.\nAggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out\nof 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the\nrequisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in\nquantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two\nprimary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from\npapers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation\nsteps, demonstrating good results in both cases.

On the other hand, more recent work has employed deep neural\nnetworks to predict complexity, but these models remain difficult to interpret,\nand do not guide a theoretical understanding of the problem.

We use\nstate-of-the-art segmentation models, SAM and FC-CLIP, to quantify the number\nof segments at multiple granularities, and the number of classes in an image\nrespectively. We find that complexity is well-explained by a simple linear\nmodel with these two features across six diverse image-sets of naturalistic\nscene and art images.

Fast moving\nplatforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and\nmapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time\nLiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving\nplatforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep\nlearning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between\nLiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more\naccurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic\ninformation in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to\nthe process, where matching occur between different objects of the same\nsemantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly\nidentifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our\nexperiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the\nrobustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental\nevaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information\nand rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry\nand mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is\ntypical for fast moving platforms.",

Black box methods do so by training\noff-the-shelf sequence models end-to-end. By contrast, task inference methods\nexplicitly infer a posterior distribution over the unknown task, typically\nusing distinct objectives and sequence models designed to enable task\ninference. Recent work has shown that task inference methods are not necessary\nfor strong performance. However, it remains unclear whether task inference\nsequence models are beneficial even when task inference objectives are not. In\nthis paper, we present evidence that task inference sequence models are indeed\nstill beneficial. In particular, we investigate sequence models with\npermutation invariant aggregation, which exploit the fact that, due to the\nMarkov property, the task posterior does not depend on the order of data. We\nempirically confirm the advantage of permutation invariant sequence models\nwithout the use of task inference objectives.

Consequently, the detection of these URLs\nis of crucial importance; however, current Machine Learning (ML) models are\nsusceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks involve manipulating a small\npercentage of training data labels, such as Label Flipping (LF), which changes\nbenign labels to malicious ones and vice versa. This manipulation results in\nmisclassification and leads to incorrect model behavior. Therefore, integrating\ndefense mechanisms into the architecture of ML models becomes an imperative\nconsideration to fortify against potential attacks.\n  The focus of this study is on backdoor attacks in the context of URL\ndetection using ensemble trees.

To\nthis end, we devise a \\underline{M}ulti-\\underline{C}oncept \\underline{P}arsed\n\\underline{S}emantic \\underline{M}atching framework based on the pre-trained\nlanguage models, abbreviated as \\textbf{MCP-SM}, to extract various concepts\nand infuse them into the classification tokens. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on English datasets QQP and MRPC, and Chinese dataset Medical-SM.\nBesides, we experiment on Arabic datasets MQ2Q and XNLI, the outstanding\nperformance further prove MCP-SM's applicability in low-resource languages.",

One of the mainstream\nbackdoor defenses is model reconstruction-based. Such defenses adopt model\nunlearning or pruning to eliminate backdoors. However, little attention has\nbeen paid to survive from such defenses. To bridge the gap, we propose Venom,\nthe first generic backdoor attack enhancer to improve the survivability of\nexisting backdoor attacks against model reconstruction-based defenses. We\nformalize Venom as a binary-task optimization problem. The first is the\noriginal backdoor attack task to preserve the original attack capability, while\nthe second is the attack enhancement task to improve the attack survivability.\nTo realize the second task, we propose attention imitation loss to force the\ndecision path of poisoned samples in backdoored models to couple with the\ncrucial decision path of benign samples, which makes backdoors difficult to\neliminate. Our extensive evaluation on two DNNs and three datasets has\ndemonstrated that Venom significantly improves the survivability of eight\nstate-of-the-art attacks against eight state-of-the-art defenses without\nimpacting the capability of the original attacks.",

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive\ndeployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained\nby complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve\ncomprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle,\ntraditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to\ndesign and deploy sensors.

Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on\nhistorical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods\nand resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the\ncomplex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak\ngeneralizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of\nspatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively,\ndynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is\nthe \\textbf{first} proposal (\\textit{termed DynST}) of an\n\\textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level.\nHowever, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of\nspatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve\nthis goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional\nmapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the\ntraining process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training,\nrepeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that\ncontribute the least to future predictions.",

However, the safety issues of their\nintegration with a vision module, or vision language models (VLMs), remain\nrelatively underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreaking attack\nagainst VLMs, aiming to bypass their safety barrier when a user inputs harmful\ninstructions. A scenario where our poisoned (image, text) data pairs are\nincluded in the training data is assumed. By replacing the original textual\ncaptions with malicious jailbreak prompts, our method can perform jailbreak\nattacks with the poisoned images. Moreover, we analyze the effect of poison\nratios and positions of trainable parameters on our attack's success rate. For\nevaluation, we design two metrics to quantify the success rate and the\nstealthiness of our attack. Together with a list of curated harmful\ninstructions, a benchmark for measuring attack efficacy is provided. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our attack by comparing it with baseline methods.",

A promising\ntechnique is to leverage the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained\nvision-language models for more guided adaptation.

Moreover, prompting only the\nlanguage branch lacks flexibility to adapt both modalities dynamically. To\nbridge this gap, we propose Domain-Agnostic Mutual Prompting (DAMP) to exploit\ndomain-invariant semantics by mutually aligning visual and textual embeddings.\nSpecifically, the image contextual information is utilized to prompt the\nlanguage branch in a domain-agnostic and instance-conditioned way. Meanwhile,\nvisual prompts are imposed based on the domain-agnostic textual prompt to\nelicit domain-invariant visual embeddings. These two branches of prompts are\nlearned mutually with a cross-attention module and regularized with a\nsemantic-consistency loss and an instance-discrimination contrastive loss.\nExperiments on three UDA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DAMP over\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the task of long-term person re-identification.\nTypically, person re-identification assumes that people do not change their\nclothes, which limits its applications to short-term scenarios. To overcome\nthis limitation, we investigate long-term person re-identification, which\nconsiders both clothes-changing and clothes-consistent scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework that effectively learns and utilizes both\nglobal and local information. The proposed framework consists of three streams:\nglobal, local body part, and head streams. The global and head streams encode\nidentity-relevant information from an entire image and a cropped image of the\nhead region, respectively. Both streams encode the most distinct, less\ndistinct, and average features using the combinations of adversarial erasing,\nmax pooling, and average pooling. The local body part stream extracts\nidentity-related information for each body part, allowing it to be compared\nwith the same body part from another image. Since body part annotations are not\navailable in re-identification datasets, pseudo-labels are generated using\nclustering. These labels are then utilized to train a body part segmentation\nhead in the local body part stream. The proposed framework is trained by\nbackpropagating the weighted summation of the identity classification loss, the\npair-based loss, and the pseudo body part segmentation loss. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three\npublicly available datasets (Celeb-reID, PRCC, and VC-Clothes).

One main bottleneck lies in its voracious appetite\nfor high-quality labeled data e.g. 3D bounding boxes and semantic segmentation,\nwhich are notoriously expensive to manually annotate. The difficulty is further\npronounced due to the prominent fact that the behaviors within samples in AD\noften suffer from long tailed distribution. In other words, a large part of\ncollected data can be trivial (e.g. simply driving forward in a straight road)\nand only a few cases are safety-critical. In this paper, we explore a\npractically important yet under-explored problem about how to achieve sample\nand label efficiency for end-to-end AD. Specifically, we design a\nplanning-oriented active learning method which progressively annotates part of\ncollected raw data according to the proposed diversity and usefulness criteria\nfor planning routes. Empirically, we show that our planning-oriented approach\ncould outperform general active learning methods by a large margin. Notably,\nour method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art end-to-end AD\nmethods - by using only 30% nuScenes data.

Therefore, without revealing the private dataset,\nthe clients can obtain a deep learning (DL) model with high performance.\nHowever, recent research proposed poisoning attacks that cause a catastrophic\nloss in the accuracy of the global model when adversaries, posed as benign\nclients, are present in a group of clients. Therefore, recent studies suggested\nbyzantine-robust FL methods that allow the server to train an accurate global\nmodel even with the adversaries present in the system. However, many existing\nmethods require the knowledge of the number of malicious clients or the\nauxiliary (clean) dataset or the effectiveness reportedly decreased hugely when\nthe private dataset was non-independently and identically distributed\n(non-IID). In this work, we propose FLGuard, a novel byzantine-robust FL method\nthat detects malicious clients and discards malicious local updates by\nutilizing the contrastive learning technique, which showed a tremendous\nimprovement as a self-supervised learning method. With contrastive models, we\ndesign FLGuard as an ensemble scheme to maximize the defensive capability. We\nevaluate FLGuard extensively under various poisoning attacks and compare the\naccuracy of the global model with existing byzantine-robust FL methods.

    "abstract": "Creating effective educational materials generally requires expensive and\ntime-consuming studies of student learning outcomes. To overcome this barrier,\none idea is to build computational models of student learning and use them to\noptimize instructional materials. However, it is difficult to model the\ncognitive processes of learning dynamics. We propose an alternative approach\nthat uses Language Models (LMs) as educational experts to assess the impact of\nvarious instructions on learning outcomes. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5 to\nevaluate the overall effect of instructional materials on different student\ngroups and find that it can replicate well-established educational findings\nsuch as the Expertise Reversal Effect and the Variability Effect. This\ndemonstrates the potential of LMs as reliable evaluators of educational\ncontent. Building on this insight, we introduce an instruction optimization\napproach in which one LM generates instructional materials using the judgments\nof another LM as a reward function. We apply this approach to create math word\nproblem worksheets aimed at maximizing student learning gains. Human teachers'\nevaluations of these LM-generated worksheets show a significant alignment\nbetween the LM judgments and human teacher preferences. We conclude by\ndiscussing potential divergences between human and LM opinions and the\nresulting pitfalls of automating instructional design.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, personalized recommendation technology has flourished and\nbecome one of the hot research directions. The matrix factorization model and\nthe metric learning model which proposed successively have been widely studied\nand applied. The latter uses the Euclidean distance instead of the dot product\nused by the former to measure the latent space vector. While avoiding the\nshortcomings of the dot product, the assumption of Euclidean distance is\nneglected, resulting in limited recommendation quality of the model. In order\nto solve this problem, this paper combines the Variationl Information\nBottleneck with metric learning model for the first time, and proposes a new\nmetric learning model VIB-DML (Variational Information Bottleneck Distance\nMetric Learning) for rating prediction, which limits the mutual information of\nthe latent space feature vector to improve the robustness of the model and\nsatisfiy the assumption of Euclidean distance by decoupling the latent space\nfeature vector. In this paper, the experimental results are compared with the\nroot mean square error (RMSE) on the three public datasets. The results show\nthat the generalization ability of VIB-DML is excellent. Compared with the\ngeneral metric learning model MetricF, the prediction error is reduced by\n7.29%. Finally, the paper proves the strong robustness of VIBDML through\nexperiments.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be very superior to conventional\nmethods in various tasks. However, their expensive computations and high memory\nrequirements are prohibitive for deployment. Model quantization is an effective\nmethod for reducing this overhead. The problem is that in most previous works,\nthe quantized model was calibrated using few samples from the training data,\nwhich might affect the generalization of the quantized LLMs to unknown cases\nand tasks. Hence in this work, we explore an important question: Can we design\na data-independent quantization method for LLMs to guarantee its generalization\nperformance? In this work, we propose EasyQuant, a training-free and\ndata-independent weight-only quantization algorithm for LLMs. Our observation\nindicates that two factors: outliers in the weight and quantization ranges, are\nessential for reducing the quantization error. Therefore, in EasyQuant, we\nleave the outliers (less than 1%) unchanged and optimize the quantization range\nto reduce the reconstruction error. With these methods, we surprisingly find\nthat EasyQuant achieves comparable performance to the original model. Since\nEasyQuant does not depend on any training data, the generalization performance\nof quantized LLMs is safely guaranteed. Moreover, EasyQuant can be implemented\nin parallel so that the quantized model could be attained in a few minutes even\nfor LLMs over 100B. To our best knowledge, we are the first work that achieves\nalmost lossless quantization performance for LLMs under a data-independent\nsetting and our algorithm runs over 10 times faster than the data-dependent\nmethods.",

This can make it more difficult to extract, recognize,\nand analyze features in the images, as well as impair the accuracy of\ncomputer-assisted diagnostic techniques and the ability of doctors to interpret\nthe images. Reducing speckle noise, therefore, is a crucial step in the\npreprocessing of ultrasound images. Researchers have proposed several speckle\nreduction methods, but no single method takes all relevant factors into\naccount. In this paper, we compare seven such methods: Median, Gaussian,\nBilateral, Average, Weiner, Anisotropic and Denoising auto-encoder without and\nwith skip connections in terms of their ability to preserve features and edges\nwhile effectively reducing noise. In an experimental study, a convolutional\nnoise-removing auto-encoder with skip connection, a deep learning method, was\nused to improve ultrasound images of breast cancer. This method involved adding\nspeckle noise at various levels. The results of the deep learning method were\ncompared to those of traditional image enhancement methods, and it was found\nthat the proposed method was more effective.

Firstly, we found that all three\nAI generators exhibited bias against women and African Americans. Moreover, we\nfound that the evident gender and racial biases uncovered in our analysis were\neven more pronounced than the status quo when compared to labor force\nstatistics or Google images, intensifying the harmful biases we are actively\nstriving to rectify in our society. Secondly, our study uncovered more nuanced\nprejudices in the portrayal of emotions and appearances. For example, women\nwere depicted as younger with more smiles and happiness, while men were\ndepicted as older with more neutral expressions and anger, posing a risk that\ngenerative AI models may unintentionally depict women as more submissive and\nless competent than men. Such nuanced biases, by their less overt nature, might\nbe more problematic as they can permeate perceptions unconsciously and may be\nmore difficult to rectify. Although the extent of bias varied depending on the\nmodel, the direction of bias remained consistent in both commercial and\nopen-source AI generators. As these tools become commonplace, our study\nhighlights the urgency to identify and mitigate various biases in generative\nAI, reinforcing the commitment to ensuring that AI technologies benefit all of\nhumanity for a more inclusive future.",

Although\nmany attack methods have been proposed, they mainly focus on fixed-budget\nattacks, aiming at finding the most adversarial perturbations within a fixed\nbudget for target node. However, considering the varied robustness of each\nnode, there is an inevitable dilemma caused by the fixed budget, i.e., no\nsuccessful perturbation is found when the budget is relatively small, while if\nit is too large, the yielding redundant perturbations will hurt the\ninvisibility. To break this dilemma, we propose a new type of topology attack,\nnamed minimum-budget topology attack, aiming to adaptively find the minimum\nperturbation sufficient for a successful attack on each node. To this end, we\npropose an attack model, named MiBTack, based on a dynamic projected gradient\ndescent algorithm, which can effectively solve the involving non-convex\nconstraint optimization on discrete topology. Extensive results on three GNNs\nand four real-world datasets show that MiBTack can successfully lead all target\nnodes misclassified with the minimum perturbation edges. Moreover, the obtained\nminimum budget can be used to measure node robustness, so we can explore the\nrelationships of robustness, topology, and uncertainty for nodes, which is\nbeyond what the current fixed-budget topology attacks can offer.",

    "abstract": "Graph-level contrastive learning, aiming to learn the representations for\neach graph by contrasting two augmented graphs, has attracted considerable\nattention. Previous studies usually simply assume that a graph and its\naugmented graph as a positive pair, otherwise as a negative pair. However, it\nis well known that graph structure is always complex and multi-scale, which\ngives rise to a fundamental question: after graph augmentation, will the\nprevious assumption still hold in reality? By an experimental analysis, we\ndiscover the semantic information of an augmented graph structure may be not\nconsistent as original graph structure, and whether two augmented graphs are\npositive or negative pairs is highly related with the multi-scale structures.\nBased on this finding, we propose a multi-scale subgraph contrastive learning\narchitecture which is able to characterize the fine-grained semantic\ninformation. Specifically, we generate global and local views at different\nscales based on subgraph sampling, and construct multiple contrastive\nrelationships according to their semantic associations to provide richer\nself-supervised signals. Extensive experiments and parametric analyzes on eight\ngraph classification real-world datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method.",

To mitigate these issues, we have\nfinetuned LLMs specifically for Vietnamese and developed a comprehensive\nevaluation framework encompassing 10 common tasks and 31 metrics. Our\nevaluation results reveal that the fine-tuned LLMs exhibit enhanced\ncomprehension and generative capabilities in Vietnamese. Moreover, our analysis\nindicates that models with more parameters can introduce more biases and\nuncalibrated outputs and the key factor influencing LLM performance is the\nquality of the training or fine-tuning datasets.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized\nnatural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models\nincur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of\n175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point\noperations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on\nrepeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However,\nexisting caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among\nLLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable\nfalse hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric\nsemantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar\nqueries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a\nuser's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather\nthan re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and\nenvironmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to\ncollaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy.\nBy placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces\nthe latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false\nhit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query,\noffering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query\nresponses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the\nstate-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately\n17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache\nhit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It\nalso reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache\nhit-and-miss decisions by 11%.",

    "abstract": "Photonic computing has emerged as a promising solution for accelerating\ncomputation-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, offering\nunparalleled speed and energy efficiency, especially in resource-limited,\nlatency-sensitive edge computing environments. However, the deployment of\nanalog photonic tensor accelerators encounters reliability challenges due to\nhardware noise and environmental variations. While off-chip noise-aware\ntraining and on-chip training have been proposed to enhance the variation\ntolerance of optical neural accelerators with moderate, static noise, we\nobserve a notable performance degradation over time due to temporally drifting\nvariations, which requires a real-time, in-situ calibration mechanism. To\ntackle this challenging reliability issues, for the first time, we propose a\nlightweight dynamic on-chip remediation framework, dubbed DOCTOR, providing\nadaptive, in-situ accuracy recovery against temporally drifting noise. The\nDOCTOR framework intelligently monitors the chip status using adaptive probing\nand performs fast in-situ training-free calibration to restore accuracy when\nnecessary. Recognizing nonuniform spatial variation distributions across\ndevices and tensor cores, we also propose a variation-aware architectural\nremapping strategy to avoid executing critical tasks on noisy devices.\nExtensive experiments show that our proposed framework can guarantee sustained\nperformance under drifting variations with 34% higher accuracy and 2-3\norders-of-magnitude lower overhead compared to state-of-the-art on-chip\ntraining methods.

One drawback is that\nstrategy of each agent in MARL is independent but actually in cooperation.\nThus, a vertical issue in multi-agent reinforcement learning is how to\nefficiently accelerate training process. To address this problem, current\nresearch has leveraged a centralized function(CF) across multiple agents to\nlearn contribution of the team reward for each agent.

    "abstract": "Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network\nattacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable\nand effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However,\nexisting researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among\nsystem working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution\nmechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association\nrelationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS,\nthis paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e.\nMAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer\nfirst constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the\nchange patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better\nlocate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the\ninter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently,\nbased on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of\nseries-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture\nthe series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three\nassociated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed\nto jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed\nby comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted\ncomparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application\ndomains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water\ntreatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by\nourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect\nfine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) hold interesting potential for the design,\ndevelopment, and research of video games. Building on the decades of prior\nresearch on generative AI in games, many researchers have sped to investigate\nthe power and potential of LLMs for games. Given the recent spike in\nLLM-related research in games, there is already a wealth of relevant research\nto survey. In order to capture a snapshot of the state of LLM research in\ngames, and to help lay the foundation for future work, we carried out an\ninitial scoping review of relevant papers published so far. In this paper, we\nreview 76 papers published between 2022 to early 2024 on LLMs and video games,\nwith key focus areas in game AI, game development, narrative, and game research\nand reviews. Our paper provides an early state of the field and lays the\ngroundwork for future research and reviews on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Defocus blur is a persistent problem in microscope imaging that poses harm to\npathology interpretation and medical intervention in cell microscopy and\nmicroscope surgery. To address this problem, a unified framework including the\nmulti-pyramid transformer (MPT) and extended frequency contrastive\nregularization (EFCR) is proposed to tackle two outstanding challenges in\nmicroscopy deblur: longer attention span and data deficiency. The MPT employs\nan explicit pyramid structure at each network stage that integrates the\ncross-scale window attention (CSWA), the intra-scale channel attention (ISCA),\nand the feature-enhancing feed-forward network (FEFN) to capture long-range\ncross-scale spatial interaction and global channel context. The EFCR addresses\nthe data deficiency problem by exploring latent deblur signals from different\nfrequency bands. It also enables deblur knowledge transfer to learn\ncross-domain information from extra data, improving deblur performance for\nlabeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments and downstream task\nvalidation show the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmultiple datasets. Project page: https://github.com/PieceZhang/MPT-CataBlur.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the second ChatGPT4PCG competition at the 2024 IEEE\nConference on Games. In this edition of the competition, we follow the first\nedition, but make several improvements and changes. We introduce a new\nevaluation metric along with allowing a more flexible format for participants'\nsubmissions and making several improvements to the evaluation pipeline.\nContinuing from the first edition, we aim to foster and explore the realm of\nprompt engineering (PE) for procedural content generation (PCG). While the\nfirst competition saw success, it was hindered by various limitations; we aim\nto mitigate these limitations in this edition. We introduce diversity as a new\nmetric to discourage submissions aimed at producing repetitive structures.\nFurthermore, we allow submission of a Python program instead of a prompt text\nfile for greater flexibility in implementing advanced PE approaches, which may\nrequire control flow, including conditions and iterations. We also make several\nimprovements to the evaluation pipeline with a better classifier for similarity\nevaluation and better-performing function signatures. We thoroughly evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the new metric and the improved classifier. Additionally,\nwe perform an ablation study to select a function signature to instruct ChatGPT\nfor level generation. Finally, we provide implementation examples of various PE\ntechniques in Python and evaluate their preliminary performance. We hope this\ncompetition serves as a resource and platform for learning about PE and PCG in\ngeneral.",

    "abstract": "Gradient-type distributed optimization methods have blossomed into one of the\nmost important tools for solving a minimization learning task over a networked\nagent system. However, only one gradient update per iteration is difficult to\nachieve a substantive acceleration of convergence. In this paper, we propose an\naccelerated framework named as MUSIC allowing each agent to perform multiple\nlocal updates and a single combination in each iteration. More importantly, we\nequip inexact and exact distributed optimization methods into this framework,\nthereby developing two new algorithms that exhibit accelerated linear\nconvergence and high communication efficiency. Our rigorous convergence\nanalysis reveals the sources of steady-state errors arising from inexact\npolicies and offers effective solutions. Numerical results based on synthetic\nand real datasets demonstrate both our theoretical motivations and analysis, as\nwell as performance advantages.",

It\nprovides the benefit of comprehending the research problem and understanding\nthe current research situation while conducting a comparative analysis of prior\nworks.

The\nprevious LLM-based studies on literature review mainly focused on the complete\nprocess, including literature retrieval, screening, and summarization. However,\nfor the summarization step, simple CoT method often lacks the ability to\nprovide extensive comparative summary. In this work, we firstly focus on the\nindependent literature summarization step and introduce ChatCite, an LLM agent\nwith human workflow guidance for comparative literature summary. This agent, by\nmimicking the human workflow, first extracts key elements from relevant\nliterature and then generates summaries using a Reflective Incremental\nMechanism. In order to better evaluate the quality of the generated summaries,\nwe devised a LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score, in refer to the\nhuman evaluation criteria. The ChatCite agent outperformed other models in\nvarious dimensions in the experiments. The literature summaries generated by\nChatCite can also be directly used for drafting literature reviews.",

To address this, we introduce a multilingual structured\nreasoning and explanation dataset, termed xSTREET, that covers four tasks\nacross six languages. xSTREET exposes a gap in base LLM performance between\nEnglish and non-English reasoning tasks.\n  We then propose two methods to remedy this gap, building on the insight that\nLLMs trained on code are better reasoners. First, at training time, we augment\na code dataset with multilingual comments using machine translation while\nkeeping program code as-is. Second, at inference time, we bridge the gap\nbetween training and inference by employing a prompt structure that\nincorporates step-by-step code primitives to derive new facts and find a\nsolution. Our methods show improved multilingual performance on xSTREET, most\nnotably on the scientific commonsense reasoning subtask. Furthermore, the\nmodels show no regression on non-reasoning tasks, thus demonstrating our\ntechniques maintain general-purpose abilities.",

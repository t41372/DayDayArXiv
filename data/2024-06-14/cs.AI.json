The challenge for the January 24-25, 2024\nworkshop was to transform those aspirations regarding one specific but crucial\nissue -- the ability of individuals to challenge government decisions made\nabout themselves -- into actionable guidance enabling agencies to develop,\nprocure, and use genuinely contestable advanced automated decision-making\nsystems. While the Administration has taken important steps since the October\n2023 EO, the insights garnered from our workshop remain highly relevant, as the\nrequirements for contestability of advanced decision-making systems are not yet\nfully defined or implemented.\n  The workshop brought together technologists, members of government agencies\nand civil society organizations, litigators, and researchers in an intensive\ntwo-day meeting that examined the challenges that users, developers, and\nagencies faced in enabling contestability in light of advanced automated\ndecision-making systems. To ensure a free and open flow of discussion, the\nmeeting was held under a modified version of the Chatham House rule.\nParticipants were free to use any information or details that they learned, but\nthey may not attribute any remarks made at the meeting by the identity or the\naffiliation of the speaker. Thus, the workshop summary that follows anonymizes\nspeakers and their affiliation. Where an identification of an agency, company,\nor organization is made, it is done from a public, identified resource and does\nnot necessarily reflect statements made by participants at the workshop.\n  This document is a report of that workshop, along with recommendations and\nexplanatory material.",

      "abstract": "Building world models that accurately and comprehensively represent the real\nworld is the utmost aspiration for conditional image generative models as it\nwould enable their use as world simulators. For these models to be successful\nworld models, they should not only excel at image quality and prompt-image\nconsistency but also ensure high representation diversity. However, current\nresearch in generative models mostly focuses on creative applications that are\npredominantly concerned with human preferences of image quality and aesthetics.\nWe note that generative models have inference time mechanisms - or knobs - that\nallow the control of generation consistency, quality, and diversity. In this\npaper, we use state-of-the-art text-to-image and image-and-text-to-image models\nand their knobs to draw consistency-diversity-realism Pareto fronts that\nprovide a holistic view on consistency-diversity-realism multi-objective. Our\nexperiments suggest that realism and consistency can both be improved\nsimultaneously; however there exists a clear tradeoff between\nrealism/consistency and diversity. By looking at Pareto optimal points, we note\nthat earlier models are better at representation diversity and worse in\nconsistency/realism, and more recent models excel in consistency/realism while\ndecreasing significantly the representation diversity. By computing Pareto\nfronts on a geodiverse dataset, we find that the first version of latent\ndiffusion models tends to perform better than more recent models in all axes of\nevaluation, and there exist pronounced consistency-diversity-realism\ndisparities between geographical regions. Overall, our analysis clearly shows\nthat there is no best model and the choice of model should be determined by the\ndownstream application. With this analysis, we invite the research community to\nconsider Pareto fronts as an analytical tool to measure progress towards world\nmodels.",

This skill is crucial during the early\nneurodevelopmental stages of children. Inspired by the AVR tasks in Raven's\nProgressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC),\nwe propose a new dataset MaRs-VQA and a new benchmark VCog-Bench containing\nthree datasets to evaluate the zero-shot AVR capability of MLLMs and compare\ntheir performance with existing human intelligent investigation. Our\ncomparative experiments with different open-source and closed-source MLLMs on\nthe VCog-Bench revealed a gap between MLLMs and human intelligence,\nhighlighting the visual cognitive limitations of current MLLMs. We believe that\nthe public release of VCog-Bench, consisting of MaRs-VQA, and the inference\npipeline will drive progress toward the next generation of MLLMs with\nhuman-like visual cognition abilities.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of open-source foundation models has brought\ntransparency and accessibility to this groundbreaking technology. However, this\nopenness has also enabled the development of highly-capable, unsafe models, as\nexemplified by recent instances such as WormGPT and FraudGPT, which are\nspecifically designed to facilitate criminal activity. As the capabilities of\nopen foundation models continue to grow, potentially outpacing those of\nclosed-source models, the risk of misuse by bad actors poses an increasingly\nserious threat to society. This paper addresses the critical question of how\nopen foundation model developers should approach model safety in light of these\nchallenges. Our analysis reveals that open-source foundation model companies\noften provide less restrictive acceptable use policies (AUPs) compared to their\nclosed-source counterparts, likely due to the inherent difficulties in\nenforcing such policies once the models are released. To tackle this issue, we\nintroduce PRISM, a design framework for open-source foundation model safety\nthat emphasizes Private, Robust, Independent Safety measures, at Minimal\nmarginal cost of compute. The PRISM framework proposes the use of modular\nfunctions that moderate prompts and outputs independently of the core language\nmodel, offering a more adaptable and resilient approach to safety compared to\nthe brittle reinforcement learning methods currently used for value alignment.\nBy focusing on identifying AUP violations and engaging the developer community\nin establishing consensus around safety design decisions, PRISM aims to create\na safer open-source ecosystem that maximizes the potential of these powerful\ntechnologies while minimizing the risks to individuals and society as a whole.",

Recently, there's been an increased focus on designing\nKGC methods that can excel in the {\\it inductive setting}, where a portion or\nall of the entities and relations seen in inference are unobserved during\ntraining. Numerous benchmark datasets have been proposed for inductive KGC, all\nof which are subsets of existing KGs used for transductive KGC. However, we\nfind that the current procedure for constructing inductive KGC datasets\ninadvertently creates a shortcut that can be exploited even while disregarding\nthe relational information. Specifically, we observe that the Personalized\nPageRank (PPR) score can achieve strong or near SOTA performance on most\ninductive datasets. In this paper, we study the root cause of this problem.\nUsing these insights, we propose an alternative strategy for constructing\ninductive KGC datasets that helps mitigate the PPR shortcut. We then benchmark\nmultiple popular methods using the newly constructed datasets and analyze their\nperformance. The new benchmark datasets help promote a better understanding of\nthe capabilities and challenges of inductive KGC by removing any shortcuts that\nobfuscate performance.",

      "abstract": "Speaker identity plays a significant role in human communication and is being\nincreasingly used in societal applications, many through advances in machine\nlearning. Speaker identity perception is an essential cognitive phenomenon that\ncan be broadly reduced to two main tasks: recognizing a voice or discriminating\nbetween voices. Several studies have attempted to identify acoustic correlates\nof identity perception to pinpoint salient parameters for such a task. Unlike\nother communicative social signals, most efforts have yielded inefficacious\nconclusions. Furthermore, current neurocognitive models of voice identity\nprocessing consider the bases of perception as acoustic dimensions such as\nfundamental frequency, harmonics-to-noise ratio, and formant dispersion.\nHowever, these findings do not account for naturalistic speech and\nwithin-speaker variability. Representational spaces of current self-supervised\nmodels have shown significant performance in various speech-related tasks. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that self-supervised representations from different\nfamilies (e.g., generative, contrastive, and predictive models) are\nsignificantly better for speaker identification over acoustic representations.\nWe also show that such a speaker identification task can be used to better\nunderstand the nature of acoustic information representation in different\nlayers of these powerful networks. By evaluating speaker identification\naccuracy across acoustic, phonemic, prosodic, and linguistic variants, we\nreport similarity between model performance and human identity perception. We\nfurther examine these similarities by juxtaposing the encoding spaces of models\nand humans and challenging the use of distance metrics as a proxy for speaker\nproximity. Lastly, we show that some models can predict brain responses in\nAuditory and Language regions during naturalistic stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there has been much work on the design of general heuristics for\ngraph-based, combinatorial optimization problems via the incorporation of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) to learn distribution-specific solution\nstructures.However, there is a lack of consistency in the evaluation of these\nheuristics, in terms of the baselines and instances chosen, which makes it\ndifficult to assess the relative performance of the algorithms. In this paper,\nwe propose an open-source benchmark suite MaxCut-Bench dedicated to the NP-hard\nMaximum Cut problem in both its weighted and unweighted variants, based on a\ncareful selection of instances curated from diverse graph datasets. The suite\noffers a unified interface to various heuristics, both traditional and machine\nlearning-based. Next, we use the benchmark in an attempt to systematically\ncorroborate or reproduce the results of several, popular learning-based\napproaches, including S2V-DQN [31], ECO-DQN [4], among others, in terms of\nthree dimensions: objective value, generalization, and scalability. Our\nempirical results show that several of the learned heuristics fail to\noutperform a naive greedy algorithm, and that only one of them consistently\noutperforms Tabu Search, a simple, general heuristic based upon local search.\nFurthermore, we find that the performance of ECO-DQN remains the same or is\nimproved if the GNN is replaced by a simple linear regression on a subset of\nthe features that are related to Tabu Search.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capacities on\nvarious tasks, and integrating the capacities of LLMs into the Internet of\nThings (IoT) applications has drawn much research attention recently. Due to\nsecurity concerns, many institutions avoid accessing state-of-the-art\ncommercial LLM services, requiring the deployment and utilization of\nopen-source LLMs in a local network setting. However, open-source LLMs usually\nhave more limitations regarding their performance, such as their arithmetic\ncalculation and reasoning capacities, and practical systems of applying LLMs to\nIoT have yet to be well-explored. Therefore, we propose a LLM-based Generative\nIoT (GIoT) system deployed in the local network setting in this study. To\nalleviate the limitations of LLMs and provide service with competitive\nperformance, we apply prompt engineering methods to enhance the capacities of\nthe open-source LLMs, design a Prompt Management Module and a Post-processing\nModule to manage the tailored prompts for different tasks and process the\nresults generated by the LLMs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nsystem, we discuss a challenging Table Question Answering (Table-QA) task as a\ncase study of the proposed system, as tabular data is usually more challenging\nthan plain text because of their complex structures, heterogeneous data types\nand sometimes huge sizes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two popular\nTable-QA datasets, and the results show that our proposal can achieve\ncompetitive performance compared with state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating that\nthe proposed LLM-based GIoT system can provide competitive performance with\ntailored prompting methods and is easily extensible to new tasks without\ntraining.",

This task challenges models to discern and\ndisregard superfluous elements in both images and text to accurately answer\nquestions and to follow intricate instructions to pinpoint the relevant image.\nIn support of this task, we further craft a new VEGA dataset, tailored for the\nIITC task on scientific content, and devised a subtask, Image-Text Association\n(ITA), to refine image-text correlation skills.

      "abstract": "Reward models trained on human preference data have been proven to\neffectively align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent within the\nframework of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,\ncurrent reward models have limited generalization capabilities to unseen\nprompts and responses, which can lead to an unexpected phenomenon known as\nreward over-optimization, resulting in a decline in actual performance due to\nexcessive optimization of rewards. While previous research has advocated for\nconstraining policy optimization, our study introduces a novel approach to\nenhance the reward model's generalization ability against distribution shifts\nby regularizing the hidden states. Specifically, we retain the base model's\nlanguage model head and incorporate a suite of text-generation losses to\npreserve the hidden states' text-generation capabilities, while concurrently\nlearning a reward head behind the same hidden states. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that the introduced regularization technique markedly improves the\naccuracy of learned reward models across a variety of out-of-distribution (OOD)\ntasks and effectively alleviates the over-optimization issue in RLHF, offering\na more reliable and robust preference learning paradigm.",

Generating object-correct\ncounts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep\na sense of separate identity for every instance of the object, even if several\nobjects look identical or overlap, and then carry out a global computation\nimplicitly during generation. It is still unknown if such representations\nexist. To address count-correct generation, we first identify features within\nthe diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. We then use\nthem to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process\nand detect over-generation and under-generation. We fix the latter by training\na model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object, based on\nthe layout of existing ones, and show how it can be used to guide denoising\nwith correct object count. Our approach, CountGen, does not depend on external\nsource to determine object layout, but rather uses the prior from the diffusion\nmodel itself, creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. Evaluated\non two benchmark datasets, we find that CountGen strongly outperforms the\ncount-accuracy of existing baselines.",

As image composition and\ngeneration are creative processes the artists need control over various parts\nof the images being generated. We find that just adding details about parts in\nthe base text prompt either leads to an entirely different image (e.g.,\nmissing/incorrect identity) or the extra part details simply being ignored. To\nmitigate these issues, we introduce PartCraft, which enables image generation\nbased on fine-grained part-level details specified for objects in the base text\nprompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object\ncompositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartCraft first localizes\nobject parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process.\nThis enables each part token to be localized to the right object region. After\nobtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each of the part\nregions based on fine-grained part descriptions and combine them to produce the\nfinal image. All the stages of PartCraft are based on repurposing a pre-trained\ndiffusion model, which enables it to generalize across various domains without\ntraining.

As an\nalternative, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based approaches directly output\nplans from user requests using language. Although LLMs possess extensive travel\ndomain knowledge and provide high-level information like points of interest and\npotential routes, current state-of-the-art models often generate plans that\nlack coherence, fail to satisfy constraints fully, and do not guarantee the\ngeneration of high-quality solutions.

      "abstract": "Recently, 3D assets created via reconstruction and generation have matched\nthe quality of manually crafted assets, highlighting their potential for\nreplacement. However, this potential is largely unrealized because these assets\nalways need to be converted to meshes for 3D industry applications, and the\nmeshes produced by current mesh extraction methods are significantly inferior\nto Artist-Created Meshes (AMs), i.e., meshes created by human artists.\nSpecifically, current mesh extraction methods rely on dense faces and ignore\ngeometric features, leading to inefficiencies, complicated post-processing, and\nlower representation quality. To address these issues, we introduce\nMeshAnything, a model that treats mesh extraction as a generation problem,\nproducing AMs aligned with specified shapes. By converting 3D assets in any 3D\nrepresentation into AMs, MeshAnything can be integrated with various 3D asset\nproduction methods, thereby enhancing their application across the 3D industry.\nThe architecture of MeshAnything comprises a VQ-VAE and a shape-conditioned\ndecoder-only transformer. We first learn a mesh vocabulary using the VQ-VAE,\nthen train the shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer on this vocabulary\nfor shape-conditioned autoregressive mesh generation. Our extensive experiments\nshow that our method generates AMs with hundreds of times fewer faces,\nsignificantly improving storage, rendering, and simulation efficiencies, while\nachieving precision comparable to previous methods.",

      "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, specification gaming occurs when AI systems learn\nundesired behaviors that are highly rewarded due to misspecified training\ngoals. Specification gaming can range from simple behaviors like sycophancy to\nsophisticated and pernicious behaviors like reward-tampering, where a model\ndirectly modifies its own reward mechanism. However, these more pernicious\nbehaviors may be too complex to be discovered via exploration. In this paper,\nwe study whether Large Language Model (LLM) assistants which find easily\ndiscovered forms of specification gaming will generalize to perform rarer and\nmore blatant forms, up to and including reward-tampering. We construct a\ncurriculum of increasingly sophisticated gameable environments and find that\ntraining on early-curriculum environments leads to more specification gaming on\nremaining environments. Strikingly, a small but non-negligible proportion of\nthe time, LLM assistants trained on the full curriculum generalize zero-shot to\ndirectly rewriting their own reward function. Retraining an LLM not to game\nearly-curriculum environments mitigates, but does not eliminate,\nreward-tampering in later environments. Moreover, adding harmlessness training\nto our gameable environments does not prevent reward-tampering. These results\ndemonstrate that LLMs can generalize from common forms of specification gaming\nto more pernicious reward tampering and that such behavior may be nontrivial to\nremove.",

These tasks are challenging on their own, and even more\ndemanding when the required facts are scattered across long natural text.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have an increasing impact on our lives with use\ncases such as chatbots, study support, coding support, ideation, writing\nassistance, and more. Previous studies have revealed linguistic biases in\npronouns used to describe professions or adjectives used to describe men vs\nwomen. These issues have to some degree been addressed in updated LLM versions,\nat least to pass existing tests. However, biases may still be present in the\nmodels, and repeated use of gender stereotypical language may reinforce the\nunderlying assumptions and are therefore important to examine further. This\npaper investigates gender biases in LLMs in relation to educational choices\nthrough an open-ended, true to user-case experimental design and a quantitative\nanalysis. We investigate the biases in the context of four different cultures,\nlanguages, and educational systems (English/US/UK, Danish/DK, Catalan/ES, and\nHindi/IN) for ages ranging from 10 to 16 years, corresponding to important\neducational transition points in the different countries. We find that there\nare significant and large differences in the ratio of STEM to non-STEM\nsuggested education paths provided by chatGPT when using typical girl vs boy\nnames to prompt lists of suggested things to become. There are generally fewer\nSTEM suggestions in the Danish, Spanish, and Indian context compared to the\nEnglish. We also find subtle differences in the suggested professions, which we\ncategorise and report.",

We can\nreduce this setting to two closely related settings (a) Shared - no arm\nspecific parameters, and (b) Disjoint - only arm specific parameters, enabling\nthe application of two popular state of the art algorithms - $\\texttt{LinUCB}$\nand $\\texttt{DisLinUCB}$ (Algorithm 1 in (Li et al. 2010)). When the arm\nfeatures are stochastic and satisfy a popular diversity condition, we provide\nnew regret analyses for both algorithms, significantly improving on the known\nregret guarantees of these algorithms. Our novel analysis critically exploits\nthe hybrid reward structure and the diversity condition. Moreover, we introduce\na new algorithm $\\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ that crucially modifies $\\texttt{LinUCB}$\n(using a new exploration coefficient) to account for sparsity in the hybrid\nsetting. Under the same diversity assumptions, we prove that\n$\\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ also incurs only $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for $T$ rounds. We\nperform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrating strong empirical performance of $\\texttt{HyLinUCB}$.For number of\narm specific parameters much larger than the number of shared parameters, we\nobserve that $\\texttt{DisLinUCB}$ incurs the lowest regret. In this case,\nregret of $\\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ is the second best and extremely competitive to\n$\\texttt{DisLinUCB}$. In all other situations, including our real-world\ndataset, $\\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ has significantly lower regret than\n$\\texttt{LinUCB}$, $\\texttt{DisLinUCB}$ and other SOTA baselines we considered.\nWe also empirically observe that the regret of $\\texttt{HyLinUCB}$ grows much\nslower with the number of arms compared to baselines, making it suitable even\nfor very large action spaces.",

      "abstract": "Localizing events in videos based on semantic queries is a pivotal task in\nvideo understanding, with the growing significance of user-oriented\napplications like video search. Yet, current research predominantly relies on\nnatural language queries (NLQs), overlooking the potential of using multimodal\nqueries (MQs) that integrate images to more flexibly represent semantic queries\n-- especially when it is difficult to express non-verbal or unfamiliar concepts\nin words. To bridge this gap, we introduce ICQ, a new benchmark designed for\nlocalizing events in videos with MQs, alongside an evaluation dataset\nICQ-Highlight. To accommodate and evaluate existing video localization models\nfor this new task, we propose 3 Multimodal Query Adaptation methods and a novel\nSurrogate Fine-tuning on pseudo-MQs strategy. ICQ systematically benchmarks 12\nstate-of-the-art backbone models, spanning from specialized video localization\nmodels to Video LLMs, across diverse application domains. Our experiments\nhighlight the high potential of MQs in real-world applications. We believe this\nbenchmark is a first step toward advancing MQs in video event localization.",

To validate our methodology, we apply it to a laboratory\ntestbed, namely Bulk Good Laboratory Plant, which represents a smart and\nflexible distributed multi-agent production system.

However,\napplying such benchmark-successful methods to real-world data often does not\nwork as expected. This is particularly the case for biological data where we\nexpect variability at multiple time and spatial scales. In this work, we are\nusing grain data and the goal is to detect diseases and damages. Pink fusarium,\nskinned grains, and other diseases and damages are key factors in setting the\nprice of grains or excluding dangerous grains from food production. Apart from\nchallenges stemming from differences of the data from the standard toy\ndatasets, we also present challenges that need to be overcome when explaining\ndeep learning models. For example, explainability methods have many\nhyperparameters that can give different results, and the ones published in the\npapers do not work on dissimilar images. Other challenges are more general:\nproblems with visualization of the explanations and their comparison since the\nmagnitudes of their values differ from method to method. An open fundamental\nquestion also is: How to evaluate explanations? It is a non-trivial task\nbecause the \"ground truth\" is usually missing or ill-defined. Also, human\nannotators may create what they think is an explanation of the task at hand,\nyet the machine learning model might solve it in a different and perhaps\ncounter-intuitive way. We discuss several of these challenges and evaluate\nvarious post-hoc explainability methods on grain data. We focus on robustness,\nquality of explanations, and similarity to particular \"ground truth\"\nannotations made by experts. The goal is to find the methods that overall\nperform well and could be used in this challenging task. We hope the proposed\npipeline will be used as a framework for evaluating explainability methods in\nspecific use cases.",

However, given the vast\namount of personal images accessible online, this capability raises critical\nconcerns about civil privacy. While several previous defense methods have been\ndeveloped to prevent such misuse of LDMs, they typically assume that the\ntextual prompts used by data protectors exactly match those employed by data\nexploiters. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that breaking this\nassumption, i.e., in cases where discrepancies exist between the textual\nconditions used by protectors and exploiters, could substantially reduce the\neffectiveness of these defenses. Furthermore, considering the visual encoder's\nindependence from textual prompts, we delve into the visual encoder and\nthoroughly investigate how manipulating the visual encoder affects the few-shot\nfine-tuning process of LDMs. Drawing on these insights, we propose a simple yet\neffective method called \\textbf{Prompt-Independent Defense (PID)} to safeguard\nprivacy against LDMs. We show that PID can act as a strong privacy shield on\nits own while requiring significantly less computational power. We believe our\nstudies, along with the comprehensive understanding and new defense method,\nprovide a notable advance toward reliable data protection against LDMs.",

      "abstract": "Neural implicit surfaces are a promising tool for geometry processing that\nrepresent a solid object as the zero level set of a neural network. Usually\ntrained to approximate a signed distance function of the considered object,\nthese methods exhibit great visual fidelity and quality near the surface, yet\ntheir properties tend to degrade with distance, making geometrical queries hard\nto perform without the help of complex range analysis techniques. Based on\nrecent advancements in Lipschitz neural networks, we introduce a new method for\napproximating the signed distance function of a given object. As our neural\nfunction is made 1- Lipschitz by construction, it cannot overestimate the\ndistance, which guarantees robustness even far from the surface. Moreover, the\n1-Lipschitz constraint allows us to use a different loss function, called the\nhinge-Kantorovitch-Rubinstein loss, which pushes the gradient as close to\nunit-norm as possible, thus reducing computation costs in iterative queries. As\nthis loss function only needs a rough estimate of occupancy to be optimized,\nthis means that the true distance function need not to be known. We are\ntherefore able to compute neural implicit representations of even bad quality\ngeometry such as noisy point clouds or triangle soups. We demonstrate that our\nmethods is able to approximate the distance function of any closed or open\nsurfaces or curves in the plane or in space, while still allowing sphere\ntracing or closest point projections to be performed robustly.",

Moreover, the structured nature\nof NCB's concept representations allows for intuitive inspection and the\nstraightforward integration of external knowledge, such as human input or\ninsights from other AI models like GPT-4.

      "abstract": "Recently various optimization problems, such as Mixed Integer Linear\nProgramming Problems (MILPs), have undergone comprehensive investigation,\nleveraging the capabilities of machine learning. This work focuses on\nlearning-based solutions for efficiently solving the Quadratic Assignment\nProblem (QAPs), which stands as a formidable challenge in combinatorial\noptimization. While many instances of simpler problems admit fully\npolynomial-time approximate solution (FPTAS), QAP is shown to be strongly\nNP-hard. Even finding a FPTAS for QAP is difficult, in the sense that the\nexistence of a FPTAS implies $P = NP$. Current research on QAPs suffer from\nlimited scale and computational inefficiency. To attack the aforementioned\nissues, we here propose the first solution of its kind for QAP in the\nlearn-to-improve category. This work encodes facility and location nodes\nseparately, instead of forming computationally intensive association graphs\nprevalent in current approaches. This design choice enables scalability to\nlarger problem sizes. Furthermore, a \\textbf{S}olution \\textbf{AW}are\n\\textbf{T}ransformer (SAWT) architecture integrates the incumbent solution\nmatrix with the attention score to effectively capture higher-order information\nof the QAPs.

This limitation\nhinders the widespread adoption of FL in diverse and resource-constrained\nenvironments, such as those with client devices ranging from powerful servers\nto mobile devices.

Unlike prior\nwork in this area, FedFA incorporates the layer grafting technique to align\nclients' local architectures with the largest network architecture in the FL\nsystem during model aggregation. Layer grafting ensures that all client\ncontributions are uniformly integrated into the global model, thereby\nminimizing the risk of any individual client's data skewing the model's\nparameters disproportionately and introducing security benefits. Moreover,\nFedFA introduces the scalable aggregation method to manage scale variations in\nweights among different network architectures.

      "abstract": "The Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task holds significant potential\nfor applications. Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal\ninput of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging.\nEuclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional\nrelationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a\ntree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an\nembedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is\neffective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a\nsequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window\nmodeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in\nmodeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba:\nStructured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of\nhyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the\nintrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures\nand complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space\nmodel captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire\nsequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment\nmodule and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical\nstructures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods\nwith fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are\nreduced by 78.12\\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\\%.\nExperiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current\nmajor methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.",

Upon input claims,\nRAFTS starts with evidence retrieval, where we design a retrieval pipeline to\ncollect and re-rank relevant documents from verifiable sources. Then, RAFTS\nforms contrastive arguments (i.e., supporting or refuting) conditioned on the\nretrieved evidence.

Our method effectively retrieves relevant documents\nas evidence and evaluates arguments from varying perspectives, incorporating\nnuanced information for fine-grained decision-making. Combined with informative\nin-context examples as prior, RAFTS achieves significant improvements to\nsupervised and LLM baselines without complex prompts.

These works can generate temporal node\nrepresentations by encoding the surrounding neighborhoods for the target node.\nHowever, an inherent limitation of existing TGNs is their reliance on fixed,\nhand-crafted rules for neighborhood encoding, overlooking the necessity for an\nadaptive and learnable neighborhood that can accommodate both personalization\nand temporal evolution across different timestamps. In this paper, we aim to\nenhance existing TGNs by introducing an adaptive neighborhood encoding\nmechanism. We present SEAN, a flexible plug-and-play model that can be\nseamlessly integrated with existing TGNs, effectively boosting their\nperformance. To achieve this, we decompose the adaptive neighborhood encoding\nprocess into two phases: (i) representative neighbor selection, and (ii)\ntemporal-aware neighborhood information aggregation. Specifically, we propose\nthe Representative Neighbor Selector component, which automatically pinpoints\nthe most important neighbors for the target node. It offers a tailored\nunderstanding of each node's unique surrounding context, facilitating\npersonalization. Subsequently, we propose a Temporal-aware Aggregator, which\nsynthesizes neighborhood aggregation by selectively determining the utilization\nof aggregation routes and decaying the outdated information, allowing our model\nto adaptively leverage both the contextually significant and current\ninformation during aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments by integrating\nSEAN into three representative TGNs, evaluating their performance on four\npublic datasets and one financial benchmark dataset introduced in this paper.\nThe results demonstrate that SEAN consistently leads to performance\nimprovements across all models, achieving SOTA performance and exceptional\nrobustness.",

We present an instance of such a network\nbuilt on the graph transformer architecture and propose a mechanism for\npre-experience plasticity based on the spontaneous activity of sensory neurons.\nOur results demonstrate the ability of the model to learn from experiences in\ndifferent control tasks starting from randomly connected or empty networks. We\nfurther show that structural plasticity is advantageous in environments\nnecessitating fast adaptation or with non-stationary rewards.",

      "abstract": "Solving multi-objective optimization problems for large deep neural networks\nis a challenging task due to the complexity of the loss landscape and the\nexpensive computational cost of training and evaluating models. Efficient\nPareto front approximation of large models enables multi-objective optimization\nfor various tasks such as multi-task learning and trade-off analysis. Existing\nalgorithms for learning Pareto set, including (1) evolutionary, hypernetworks,\nand hypervolume-maximization methods, are computationally expensive and have\nrestricted scalability to large models; (2) Scalarization algorithms, where a\nseparate model is trained for each objective ray, which is inefficient for\nlearning the entire Pareto set and fails to capture the objective trade-offs\neffectively. Inspired by the recent success of model merging, we propose a\npractical and scalable approach to Pareto set learning problem via mixture of\nexperts (MoE) based model fusion. By ensembling the weights of specialized\nsingle-task models, the MoE module can effectively capture the trade-offs\nbetween multiple objectives and closely approximate the entire Pareto set of\nlarge neural networks. Once the routers are learned and a preference vector is\nset, the MoE module can be unloaded, thus no additional computational cost is\nintroduced during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on vision and\nlanguage tasks using large-scale models such as CLIP-ViT and GPT-2. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method efficiently approximates the\nentire Pareto front of large models. Using only hundreds of trainable\nparameters of the MoE routers, our method even has lower memory usage compared\nto linear scalarization and algorithms that learn a single Pareto optimal\nsolution, and are scalable to both the number of objectives and the size of the\nmodel.",

This lack\nof rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of\ncontextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into\ngraph-structured data.

Our goal is\nto elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in\ndeveloping methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions\nto enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world\nnetworks.

However, can we trust this powerful\ntechnique? This paper reveals that GR can cause performance degeneration in\nadaptive optimization scenarios, particularly with learning rate warmup. Our\nempirical and theoretical analyses suggest this is due to GR inducing\ninstability and divergence in gradient statistics of adaptive optimizers at the\ninitial training stage. Inspired by the warmup heuristic, we propose three GR\nwarmup strategies, each relaxing the regularization effect to a certain extent\nduring the warmup course to ensure the accurate and stable accumulation of\ngradients. With experiments on Vision Transformer family, we confirm the three\nGR warmup strategies can effectively circumvent these issues, thereby largely\nimproving the model performance. Meanwhile, we note that scalable models tend\nto rely more on the GR warmup, where the performance can be improved by up to\n3\\% on Cifar10 compared to baseline GR.

To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel self-knowledge distillation method that enables\nmodels to learn label distributions more accurately by leveraging knowledge\ndistilled from their lower layers. This approach also includes a learning phase\nthat re-calibrates the unnecessarily strengthened confidence for training\nsamples judged as extremely ambiguous based on the distilled distribution\nknowledge. We validate our method on diverse NLU benchmark datasets and the\nexperimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in producing better label\ndistributions. Particularly, through the process of re-calibrating the\nconfidence for highly ambiguous samples, the issue of over-confidence when\npredictions for unseen samples do not match with their ground-truth labels has\nbeen significantly alleviated. This has been shown to contribute to generating\nbetter distributions than the existing state-of-the-art method. Moreover, our\nmethod is more efficient in training the models compared to the existing\nmethod, as it does not involve additional training processes to refine label\ndistributions.",

      "abstract": "Automatic code generation has been a longstanding research topic. With the\nadvancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to\ncode stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance.\nUsually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM,\nnamely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve\nthe model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to\nimprove the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either\nmodifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still\nlack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what\nkind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon\nthe SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand\nthe correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually\ncraft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a\nsynthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic\nfunctions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train\nand test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through\ncomprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions\nare indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic\nfunctions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target\ndomain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3)\nTraining RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the\nSFT phase.",

      "abstract": "Language is highly structured, with syntactic and semantic structures, to\nsome extent, agreed upon by speakers of the same language. With implicit or\nexplicit awareness of such structures, humans can learn and use language\nefficiently and generalize to sentences that contain unseen words. Motivated by\nhuman language learning, in this dissertation, we consider a family of machine\nlearning tasks that aim to learn language structures through grounding. We seek\ndistant supervision from other data sources (i.e., grounds), including but not\nlimited to other modalities (e.g., vision), execution results of programs, and\nother languages.\n  We demonstrate the potential of this task formulation and advocate for its\nadoption through three schemes. In Part I, we consider learning syntactic\nparses through visual grounding. We propose the task of visually grounded\ngrammar induction, present the first models to induce syntactic structures from\nvisually grounded text and speech, and find that the visual grounding signals\ncan help improve the parsing quality over language-only models. As a side\ncontribution, we propose a novel evaluation metric that enables the evaluation\nof speech parsing without text or automatic speech recognition systems\ninvolved. In Part II, we propose two execution-aware methods to map sentences\ninto corresponding semantic structures (i.e., programs), significantly\nimproving compositional generalization and few-shot program synthesis. In Part\nIII, we propose methods that learn language structures from annotations in\nother languages. Specifically, we propose a method that sets a new state of the\nart on cross-lingual word alignment. We then leverage the learned word\nalignments to improve the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual dependency\nparsing, by proposing a novel substructure-based projection method that\npreserves structural knowledge learned from the source language.",

      "abstract": "The accurate and timely diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes (AAS) in patients\npresenting with acute chest pain remains a clinical challenge. Aortic CT\nangiography (CTA) is the imaging protocol of choice in patients with suspected\nAAS. However, due to economic and workflow constraints in China, the majority\nof suspected patients initially undergo non-contrast CT as the initial imaging\ntesting, and CTA is reserved for those at higher risk. In this work, we present\nan artificial intelligence-based warning system, iAorta, using non-contrast CT\nfor AAS identification in China, which demonstrates remarkably high accuracy\nand provides clinicians with interpretable warnings. iAorta was evaluated\nthrough a comprehensive step-wise study. In the multi-center retrospective\nstudy (n = 20,750), iAorta achieved a mean area under the receiver operating\ncurve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the large-scale real-world study\n(n = 137,525), iAorta demonstrated consistently high performance across various\nnon-contrast CT protocols, achieving a sensitivity of 0.913-0.942 and a\nspecificity of 0.991-0.993. In the prospective comparative study (n = 13,846),\niAorta demonstrated the capability to significantly shorten the time to correct\ndiagnostic pathway. For the prospective pilot deployment that we conducted,\niAorta correctly identified 21 out of 22 patients with AAS among 15,584\nconsecutive patients presenting with acute chest pain and under non-contrast CT\nprotocol in the emergency department (ED) and enabled the average diagnostic\ntime of these 21 AAS positive patients to be 102.1 (75-133) mins. Last, the\niAorta can help avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of AAS in settings where\nnon-contrast CT remains the unavoidable the initial or only imaging test in\nresource-constrained regions and in patients who cannot or did not receive\nintravenous contrast.",

      "abstract": "Images captured under low-light scenarios often suffer from low quality.\nPrevious CNN-based deep learning methods often involve using Retinex theory.\nNevertheless, most of them cannot perform well in more complicated datasets\nlike LOL-v2 while consuming too much computational resources. Besides, some of\nthese methods require sophisticated training at different stages, making the\nprocedure even more time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we propose a\nmore accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND.\nRSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and\nreflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map\nand performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced\ngray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the\nreflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it\nobtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and\nExcitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative\nand qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly\noutperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from\n0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based\nmodels in the LOL-v2-real dataset.",

      "abstract": "While existing video benchmarks largely consider specialized downstream tasks\nlike retrieval or question-answering (QA), contemporary multimodal AI systems\nmust be capable of well-rounded common-sense reasoning akin to human visual\nunderstanding. A critical component of human temporal-visual perception is our\nability to identify and cognitively model \"things happening\", or events.\nHistorically, video benchmark tasks have implicitly tested for this ability\n(e.g., video captioning, in which models describe visual events with natural\nlanguage), but they do not consider video event understanding as a task in\nitself. Recent work has begun to explore video analogues to textual event\nextraction but consists of competing task definitions and datasets limited to\nhighly specific event types. Therefore, while there is a rich domain of\nevent-centric video research spanning the past 10+ years, it is unclear how\nvideo event understanding should be framed and what resources we have to study\nit. In this paper, we survey 105 video datasets that require event\nunderstanding capability, consider how they contribute to the study of robust\nevent understanding in video, and assess proposed video event extraction tasks\nin the context of this body of research. We propose suggestions informed by\nthis survey for dataset curation and task framing, with an emphasis on the\nuniquely temporal nature of video events and ambiguity in visual content.",

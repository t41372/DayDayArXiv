    "abstract": "Deceptive patterns (DPs) in digital interfaces manipulate users into making\nunintended decisions, exploiting cognitive biases and psychological\nvulnerabilities. These patterns have become ubiquitous across various digital\nplatforms. While efforts to mitigate DPs have emerged from legal and technical\nperspectives, a significant gap in usable solutions that empower users to\nidentify and make informed decisions about DPs in real-time remains. In this\nwork, we introduce AutoBot, an automated, deceptive pattern detector that\nanalyzes websites' visual appearances using machine learning techniques to\nidentify and notify users of DPs in real-time. AutoBot employs a two-staged\npipeline that processes website screenshots, identifying interactable elements\nand extracting textual features without relying on HTML structure. By\nleveraging a custom language model, AutoBot understands the context surrounding\nthese elements to determine the presence of deceptive patterns. We implement\nAutoBot as a lightweight Chrome browser extension that performs all analyses\nlocally, minimizing latency and preserving user privacy. Through extensive\nevaluation, we demonstrate AutoBot's effectiveness in enhancing users' ability\nto navigate digital environments safely while providing a valuable tool for\nregulators to assess and enforce compliance with DP regulations.",

Choosing how sensitive the model is to\nits context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at\ntasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this\npaper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining\nwhether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To\nguide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In\nthis task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a\nquestion (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior\nor contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer\nfor both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task,\ninstruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it\nwith high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow\ndown which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear\ntime algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single\nlayer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge.\nInterestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find\nthat the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model\nbut also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally,\nwe show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly\nit separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace.\nThese results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses\nbetween context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism\nthat controls this behavior.",

However, app reviews related to ethical\nconcerns generally use domain-specific language and are expressed using a more\nvaried vocabulary. Thus making automated ethical concern-related app review\nextraction a challenging and time-consuming effort.\n  This study proposes a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approach\nthat combines Natural Language Inference (NLI), which provides a deep\ncomprehension of language nuances, and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to extract ethical concern-related app reviews at scale.\nUtilizing 43,647 app reviews from the mental health domain, the proposed\nmethodology 1) Evaluates four NLI models to extract potential privacy reviews\nand compares the results of domain-specific privacy hypotheses with generic\nprivacy hypotheses; 2) Evaluates four LLMs for classifying app reviews to\nprivacy concerns; and 3) Uses the best NLI and LLM models further to extract\nnew privacy reviews from the dataset.

The primary challenge arises from the\ncomplex and variable conditions encountered in the surgical environment,\nparticularly in Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS).

The model was evaluated on a\ndataset comprising 40 in vivo surgical videos, demonstrating a median detection\nrate of 85%. This performance was maintained when the model was integrated in a\nclinical system, achieving a similar detection rate of 85% during TORS\nprocedures conducted in patients. The system's computational efficiency,\nmeasured at approximately 24 frames per second (FPS), was sufficient for\nreal-time surgical guidance.

Prior approaches attempt label\ncorrection and robust training techniques but exhibit limited efficacy,\nparticularly under high noise levels.

ClipFL identifies and excludes noisy clients based on their\nperformance on a clean validation dataset, tracked using a Noise Candidacy\nScore (NCS). The framework comprises three phases: pre-client pruning to\nidentify potential noisy clients and calculate their NCS, client pruning to\nexclude a percentage of clients with the highest NCS, and post-client pruning\nfor fine-tuning the global model with standard FL on clean clients. Empirical\nevaluation demonstrates ClipFL's efficacy across diverse datasets and noise\nlevels, achieving accurate noisy client identification, superior performance,\nfaster convergence, and reduced communication costs compared to\nstate-of-the-art FL methods.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by\nuncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail\nto fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been\nattributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training\nresources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods\nstruggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as\nensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in\nmultimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new\nmodalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the\nMultimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by\nmutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects\nof competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1)\nIntroducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each\nmodality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final\noutcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and\nupper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique\nand shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space\npermutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving\ncomputational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training\nstrategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond\nthe ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to\nsignificant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.",

Some recent studies benchmark the degree to which\nlarge language models encode geospatial knowledge.

In this work, we examine large language models for two\ncommon scenarios that require geographical knowledge: (a) travel\nrecommendations and (b) geo-anchored story generation. Specifically, we study\nfive popular language models, and across about $100$K travel requests, and\n$200$K story generations, we observe that travel recommendations corresponding\nto poorer countries are less unique with fewer location references, and stories\nfrom these regions more often convey emotions of hardship and sadness compared\nto those from wealthier nations.",

However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an\nagent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states\ndepicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate\nvision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map\nimage states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often\nexpensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar\nto the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to\ndirectly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in\nthe embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for\nexploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action\ngeneration in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve\ncomplex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels,\nor segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero,\n6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual\nNavigation.

Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills\ndue to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with\ndatasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the\napplication of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these\ndatasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio,\nlimiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we\npresent \\omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different\nimage editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in\nfour folds: (1) \\omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven\ndifferent specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance\nsampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o)\ninstead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing\narchitecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we\nprovide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle\nany image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of\ndifferent aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different\ntasks.

LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small\nfractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In\nthis work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a\nsingle parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing\nperplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to\nguessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed\nsuper weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally\nfind that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation\noutliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super\nactivations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we\nsimilarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight\noutliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes\nthan previously considered. To facilitate further research into super weights,\nwe provide an index of super weight coordinates for common, openly available\nLLMs.",

Our carefully curated training dataset\ncomprises text-audio pairs spanning a diverse range of bioacoustics, speech,\nand music data, designed to address the challenges posed by limited annotated\ndatasets in the field. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned\nrepresentations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows\npromising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. Importantly, we test\nNatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets the new state of\nthe art (SotA) on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot\nclassification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we also\nopen-source the code for generating training and benchmark data, as well as for\ntraining the model.",

    "abstract": "Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation aims to leverage labeled data\nfrom multiple source domains for training a machine learning model to\ngeneralize well on a target domain without labels. Source domain selection\nplays a crucial role in determining the model's performance. It relies on the\nsimilarities amongst source and target domains. Nonetheless, existing work for\nsource domain selection often involves heavyweight computational procedures,\nespecially when dealing with numerous source domains and the need to identify\nthe best ones from them. In this paper, we introduce a framework for gradual\nfine tuning (GFT) of machine learning models on multiple source domains. We\nrepresent multiple source domains as an undirected weighted graph. We then give\na new generalization error bound for GFT along any path within the graph, which\nis used to determine the optimal path corresponding to the optimal training\norder. With this formulation, we introduce three lightweight graph-routing\nstrategies which tend to minimize the error bound. Our best strategy improves\n$2.3\\%$ of accuracy over the state-of-the-art on Natural Language Inference\n(NLI) task and achieves competitive performance on Sentiment Analysis (SA)\ntask, especially a $3.9\\%$ improvement on a more diverse subset of data we use\nfor SA.",

Previous work has primarily\nrelied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or\nmanipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to\n\\emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions\nprecisely, it is useful to examine \\emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given\nsentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a\nspecific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is\nconceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal\nhierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating\ntrue string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural\nequation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel\ncounterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint\ndistribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the\nsame instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on\nhindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables\nand generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time\nshowing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired\nside effects.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel attention mechanism, named Cog Attention, that enables\nattention weights to be negative for enhanced expressiveness, which stems from\ntwo key factors: (1) Cog Attention enhances parameter flexibility. For example,\nunlike traditional softmax attention heads that use a static output-value (OV)\nmatrix to delete or copy inputs that the heads attend to, Cog Attention\nnaturally learns to use the sign of dynamic query-key (QK) inner products to\nrepresent these operations. This enables Cog Attention to perform multiple\noperations simultaneously within a single head. Meanwhile, Cog Attention's OV\nmatrix can focus more on refinement or modification. (2) Cog Attention enhances\nthe model's robustness against representational collapse by preventing the\n``over-squashing'' of earlier tokens into later positions. We develop\nTransformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including\ndecoder-only models at various scales for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion\nmodels for image generation. Experiments show that models using Cog Attention\nexhibit superior performance compared to those employing traditional softmax\nattention modules. Our approach suggests a promising research direction for\nrethinking and breaking the entrenched constraints of traditional softmax\nattention, such as the requirement for non-negative weights.",

Previous approaches either involve intensive fine-tuning of the entire\nT2I model or require users or large language models to specify generation\nlayouts, adding complexity. In this paper, we define semantic binding as the\ntask of associating a given object with its attribute, termed attribute\nbinding, or linking it to other related sub-objects, referred to as object\nbinding. We introduce a novel method called Token Merging (ToMe), which\nenhances semantic binding by aggregating relevant tokens into a single\ncomposite token. This ensures that the object, its attributes and sub-objects\nall share the same cross-attention map. Additionally, to address potential\nconfusion among main objects with complex textual prompts, we propose end token\nsubstitution as a complementary strategy. To further refine our approach in the\ninitial stages of T2I generation, where layouts are determined, we incorporate\ntwo auxiliary losses, an entropy loss and a semantic binding loss, to\niteratively update the composite token to improve the generation integrity. We\nconducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of ToMe,\ncomparing it against various existing methods on the T2I-CompBench and our\nproposed GPT-4o object binding benchmark.

To overcome these limitations, we\nincorporate bounded rationality into MFGs by leveraging the well-known concept\nof quantal response equilibria (QRE). Two novel types of MFG QRE enable the\nmodeling of large agent populations where individuals only noisily estimate the\ntrue objective. We also introduce a second source of bounded rationality to\nMFGs by restricting agents' planning horizon. The resulting novel receding\nhorizon (RH) MFGs are combined with QRE and existing approaches to model\ndifferent aspects of bounded rationality in MFGs. We formally define MFG QRE\nand RH MFGs and compare them to existing equilibrium concepts such as\nentropy-regularized NE. Subsequently, we design generalized fixed point\niteration and fictitious play algorithms to learn QRE and RH equilibria.

    "abstract": "As modern web services increasingly rely on REST APIs, their thorough testing\nhas become crucial. Furthermore, the advent of REST API documentation\nlanguages, such as the OpenAPI Specification, has led to the emergence of many\nblack-box REST API testing tools. However, these tools often focus on\nindividual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values),\nresulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in fault detection. To\naddress these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box tool to\nadopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing that\nintegrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a semantic property\ndependency graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats\nREST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency,\nparameter, and value agents -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs\nhandle domain-specific value generation, the SPDG model simplifies the search\nspace for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and\nMARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Our evaluation of AutoRestTest\non 12 real-world REST services shows that it outperforms the four leading\nblack-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which\ngenerates realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage,\noperation coverage, and fault detection. Notably, AutoRestTest is the only tool\nable to trigger an internal server error in the Spotify service. Our ablation\nstudy illustrates that each component of AutoRestTest -- the SPDG, the LLM, and\nthe agent-learning mechanism -- contributes to its overall effectiveness.",

To manage the\ncomplexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we\ndevelop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that\nseparates the sensing and control components of the policy.

To address these, we figure out audio-visual character\nidentification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We\npropose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos,\nincorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information.\nStoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual,\naudio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on\nminute-long video clips.

We validate our approach on movie description\ntasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for\nthree-minute movie clips.

It consists of a unified Hierarchical Data\nRepresentation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning\n(HiSL) module as graph encoder. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs,\ntemporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then\nHiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on\nenhancing the semantic information within individual facts and enriching the\nstructural information between facts. Empirical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of UniHR and highlight the strong potential of unified\nrepresentations. Code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/Lza12a/UniHR.",

    "abstract": "Satellite clock bias prediction plays a crucial role in enhancing the\naccuracy of satellite navigation systems. In this paper, we propose an approach\nutilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict satellite clock\nbias. We gather data from the PRN 8 satellite of the Galileo and preprocess it\nto obtain a single difference sequence, crucial for normalizing the data.\nNormalization allows resampling of the data, ensuring that the predictions are\nequidistant and complete. Our methodology involves training the LSTM model on\nvarying lengths of datasets, ranging from 7 days to 31 days. We employ a\ntraining set consisting of two days' worth of data in each case. Our LSTM model\nexhibits exceptional accuracy, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11\n$\\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Notably, our approach outperforms traditional methods used\nfor similar time-series forecasting projects, being 170 times more accurate\nthan RNN, 2.3 $\\times$ 10$^7$ times more accurate than MLP, and 1.9 $\\times$\n10$^4$ times more accurate than ARIMA. This study holds significant potential\nin enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of low-power receivers used in various\ndevices, particularly those requiring power conservation. By providing more\naccurate predictions of satellite clock bias, the findings of this research can\nbe integrated into the algorithms of such devices, enabling them to function\nwith heightened precision while conserving power. Improved accuracy in clock\nbias predictions ensures that low-power receivers can maintain optimal\nperformance levels, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and effectiveness\nof satellite navigation systems. Consequently, this advancement holds promise\nfor a wide range of applications, including remote areas, IoT devices, wearable\ntechnology, and other devices where power efficiency and navigation accuracy\nare paramount.",

As a representative example, non-autoregressive Transformers\n(NATs) can generate decent-quality images in a few steps. NATs perform\ngeneration in a progressive manner, where the latent tokens of a resulting\nimage are incrementally revealed. At each step, the unrevealed image regions\nare padded with mask tokens and inferred by NAT. In this paper, we delve into\nthe mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important\npatterns that naturally emerge from NATs: Spatially (within a step), although\nmask and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions\nbetween them are highly asymmetric. In specific, mask tokens mainly gather\ninformation for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide\ninformation, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves.\nTemporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps\nmostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens,\nwhile the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive.\nDriven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that\nexplicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the\nspatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and mask tokens by\nencoding visible tokens independently, while decoding mask tokens conditioned\non the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the\ncomputation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing\npreviously computed token representations to supplement necessary information.\nENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced\ncomputational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256, ImageNet-512 and MS-COCO\nvalidate the effectiveness of ENAT. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ENAT.",

Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus\ndecoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or\nright side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact\ndirection of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing.\nAdditionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged,\nresulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, it is found that on\nthe recently presented dataset with 14-class directional focus, models relying\nexclusively on EEG inputs exhibit significantly lower accuracy when decoding\nthe directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out\nscenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding\naccuracy can be effectively improved. The CNN, LSM-CNN, and Deformer models are\nemployed to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals and audio\nspatial spectra. The proposed Sp-EEG-Deformer model achieves notable 14-class\ndecoding accuracies of 55.35% and 57.19% in leave-one-subject-out and\nleave-one-trial-out scenarios with a decision window of 1 second, respectively.\nExperiment results indicate increased decoding accuracy as the number of\nalternative directions reduces.

Thus, a green multi-modal\n(MM) fusion DOA framework is proposed to realize a more practical, low-cost and\nhigh time-efficiency DOA estimation for a H$^2$AD array. Firstly, two more\nefficient clustering methods, global maximum cos\\_similarity clustering\n(GMaxCS) and global minimum distance clustering (GMinD), are presented to infer\nmore precise true solutions from the candidate solution sets. Based on this, an\niteration weighted fusion (IWF)-based method is introduced to iteratively\nupdate weighted fusion coefficients and the clustering center of the true\nsolution classes by using the estimated values. Particularly, the coarse DOA\ncalculated by fully digital (FD) subarray, serves as the initial cluster\ncenter. The above process yields two methods called MM-IWF-GMaxCS and\nMM-IWF-GMinD. To further provide a higher-accuracy DOA estimation, a fusion\nnetwork (fusionNet) is proposed to aggregate the inferred two-part true angles\nand thus generates two effective approaches called MM-fusionNet-GMaxCS and\nMM-fusionNet-GMinD. The simulation outcomes show the proposed four approaches\ncan achieve the ideal DOA performance and the CRLB.

    "abstract": "Segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRI) is crucial for the\nanalysis and assessment of cardiac function, helping to diagnose and treat\nvarious cardiovascular diseases. Most recent techniques rely on deep learning\nand usually require an extensive amount of labeled data. To overcome this\nproblem, few-shot learning has the capability of reducing data dependency on\nlabeled data. In this work, we introduce a new method that merges few-shot\nlearning with a U-Net architecture and Gaussian Process Emulators (GPEs),\nenhancing data integration from a support set for improved performance. GPEs\nare trained to learn the relation between the support images and the\ncorresponding masks in latent space, facilitating the segmentation of unseen\nquery images given only a small labeled support set at inference. We test our\nmodel with the M&Ms-2 public dataset to assess its ability to segment the heart\nin cardiac magnetic resonance imaging from different orientations, and compare\nit with state-of-the-art unsupervised and few-shot methods. Our architecture\nshows higher DICE coefficients compared to these methods, especially in the\nmore challenging setups where the size of the support set is considerably\nsmall.",

For instance, within the scenario of\ntransaction risk management, a graph pattern that is characteristic of a\nparticular risk category can be readily employed to discern transactions\nfraught with risk, delineate networks of criminal activity, or investigate the\nmethodologies employed by fraudsters. Nonetheless, graph data in industrial\nsettings is often characterized by its massive scale, encompassing data sets\nwith millions or even billions of nodes, making the manual extraction of graph\npatterns not only labor-intensive but also necessitating specialized knowledge\nin particular domains of risk. Moreover, existing methodologies for mining\ngraph patterns encounter significant obstacles when tasked with analyzing\nlarge-scale attributed graphs. In this work, we introduce GraphRPM, an\nindustry-purpose parallel and distributed risk pattern mining framework on\nlarge attributed graphs. The framework incorporates a novel edge-involved graph\nisomorphism network alongside optimized operations for parallel graph\ncomputation, which collectively contribute to a considerable reduction in\ncomputational complexity and resource expenditure. Moreover, the intelligent\nfiltration of efficacious risky graph patterns is facilitated by the proposed\nevaluation metrics.

Previous studies predominantly\nemploy an extracting-and-modeling paradigm to harness the information in KG,\nwhich first extracts relevant subgraphs based on pre-defined rules and then\nproceeds to design various strategies aiming to improve the representations and\nfusion of the extracted structural knowledge. Despite their effectiveness,\nthere are still two challenges. On one hand, subgraphs extracted by rule-based\nmethods may have the potential to overlook critical nodes and result in\nuncontrollable subgraph size. On the other hand, the misalignment between graph\nand text modalities undermines the effectiveness of knowledge fusion,\nultimately impacting the task performance.

Firstly,\nwe transform the knowledge graph into a database of subgraph vectors and\npropose a BFS-style subgraph sampling strategy to avoid information loss,\nleveraging the analogy between BFS and the message-passing mechanism. In\naddition, we propose a bidirectional contrastive learning approach for\ngraph-text alignment, which effectively enhances both subgraph retrieval and\nknowledge fusion.

However, machine\nlearning models are well-documented to be vulnerable to malicious\nmanipulations, and this susceptibility extends to the models of QML. This\nsituation necessitates a thorough understanding of QML's resilience against\nadversarial attacks, particularly in an era where quantum computing\ncapabilities are expanding. In this regard, this paper examines\nmodel-independent bounds on adversarial performance for QML. To the best of our\nknowledge, we introduce the first computation of an approximate lower bound for\nadversarial error when evaluating model resilience against sophisticated\nquantum-based adversarial attacks. Experimental results are compared to the\ncomputed bound, demonstrating the potential of QML models to achieve high\nrobustness. In the best case, the experimental error is only 10% above the\nestimated bound, offering evidence of the inherent robustness of quantum\nmodels. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of quantum\nmodel resilience but also provides a precise reference bound for the future\ndevelopment of robust QML algorithms.",

The Lotka-Volterra model is critical for understanding ecological\ndynamics, population control, and species interactions, as it is represented by\na system of differential equations. In this work, we aim to uncover the\nunderlying differential equations without prior knowledge of the system,\nrelying solely on training data and neural networks. Using robust modeling in\nthe Julia programming language, we demonstrate that both Neural ODEs and UDEs\ncan be effectively utilized for prediction and forecasting of the\nLotka-Volterra system. More importantly, we introduce the forecasting breakdown\npoint: the time at which forecasting fails for both Neural ODEs and UDEs. We\nobserve how UDEs outperform Neural ODEs by effectively recovering the\nunderlying dynamics and achieving accurate forecasting with significantly less\ntraining data. Additionally, we introduce Gaussian noise of varying magnitudes\n(from mild to high) to simulate real-world data perturbations and show that\nUDEs exhibit superior robustness, effectively recovering the underlying\ndynamics even in the presence of noisy data, while Neural ODEs struggle with\nhigh levels of noise.

We conduct intensive\nexperimental verifications on more than ten representative scenarios from\nphysics, biochemistry, ecology, epidemiology, etc. Results demonstrate the\noutstanding effectiveness and efficiency of our tool by comparing with the\nstate-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques for network dynamics.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of ``generative midtended cognition'',\nexploring the integration of generative AI with human cognition. The term\n\"generative\" reflects AI's ability to iteratively produce structured outputs,\nwhile \"midtended\" captures the potential hybrid (human-AI) nature of the\nprocess. It stands between traditional conceptions of intended creation,\nunderstood directed from within, and extended processes that bring\nexo-biological processes into the creative process. We examine current\ngenerative technologies (based on multimodal transformer architectures typical\nof large language models like ChatGPT), to explain how they can transform human\ncognitive agency beyond what standard theories of extended cognition can\ncapture. We suggest that the type of cognitive activity typical of the coupling\nbetween a human and generative technologies is closer (but not equivalent) to\nsocial cognition than to classical extended cognitive paradigms. Yet, it\ndeserves a specific treatment. We provide an explicit definition of generative\nmidtended cognition in which we treat interventions by AI systems as\nconstitutive of the agent's intentional creative processes. Furthermore, we\ndistinguish two dimensions of generative hybrid creativity: 1. Width: captures\nthe sensitivity of the context of the generative process (from the single\nletter to the whole historical and surrounding data), 2. Depth: captures the\ngranularity of iteration loops involved in the process. Generative midtended\ncognition stands in the middle depth between conversational forms of cognition\nin which complete utterances or creative units are exchanged, and\nmicro-cognitive (e.g. neural) subpersonal processes. Finally, the paper\ndiscusses the potential risks and benefits of widespread generative AI\nadoption, including the challenges of authenticity, generative power asymmetry,\nand creative boost or atrophy.",

    "abstract": "By exploiting discrete signal processing and simulating brain neuron\ncommunication, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a low-energy alternative to\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNN models, still face\nhigh computational costs due to the numerous time steps as well as network\ndepth and scale. The tens of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses in\nthe human brain are developed from only 20,000 genes, which inspires us to\ndesign an efficient genetic encoding strategy that dynamic evolves to regulate\nlarge-scale deep SNNs at low cost. Therefore, we first propose a genetically\nscaled SNN encoding scheme that incorporates globally shared genetic\ninteractions to indirectly optimize neuronal encoding instead of weight, which\nobviously brings about reductions in parameters and energy consumption. Then, a\nspatio-temporal evolutionary framework is designed to optimize the inherently\ninitial wiring rules. Two dynamic regularization operators in the fitness\nfunction evolve the neuronal encoding to a suitable distribution and enhance\ninformation quality of the genetic interaction respectively, substantially\naccelerating evolutionary speed and improving efficiency. Experiments show that\nour approach compresses parameters by approximately 50\\% to 80\\%, while\noutperforming models on the same architectures by 0.21\\% to 4.38\\% on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100 and ImageNet. In summary, the consistent trends of the proposed\ngenetically encoded spatio-temporal evolution across different datasets and\narchitectures highlight its significant enhancements in terms of efficiency,\nbroad scalability and robustness, demonstrating the advantages of the\nbrain-inspired evolutionary genetic coding for SNN optimization.",

To make this possible, our analysis\nunderlines the importance of seeking effective strategies to align (1) feature\ncomputing paradigm differences, (2) model scale differences, and (3) knowledge\ndensity differences. By combining three coupled components namely cross\nattention projector, dual-view feature mimicking and teacher parameter\nperception tailored to address the above problems, we present a simple and\neffective KD method, called ScaleKD.

The\nstudent backbones trained by our method transfer well on downstream MS-COCO and\nADE20K datasets.

    "abstract": "Molecular docking is a crucial step in drug development, which enables the\nvirtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that\ntarget proteins of interest. However, the computational complexity of\ntraditional docking models increases as the size of the compound library\nincreases. Recently, deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research\nand development models to increase the speed of the docking process.\nUnfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared\nto that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking\napproach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages\nmultimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural\nknowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the\ncorresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental\nresults show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53% and 82.71% on the\nPDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a\n100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all\nstate-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to\nidentify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a\nreal-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy\nand screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust\ntool in the field of drug design.",

Many current systems rely on rigid, rule-based\ndesigns, heavily dependent on expert-crafted dialogue scripts for guiding\ntherapeutic conversations. Although recent advances in large language models\n(LLMs) offer the potential for more flexible interactions, their lack of\ncontrollability and transparency poses significant challenges in sensitive\nareas like psychotherapy. In this work, we explored how aligning LLMs with\nexpert-crafted scripts can enhance psychotherapeutic chatbot performance. Our\ncomparative study showed that LLMs aligned with expert-crafted scripts through\nprompting and fine-tuning significantly outperformed both pure LLMs and\nrule-based chatbots, achieving a more effective balance between dialogue\nflexibility and adherence to therapeutic principles. Building on findings, we\nproposed ``Script-Strategy Aligned Generation (SSAG)'', a flexible alignment\napproach that reduces reliance on fully scripted content while enhancing LLMs'\ntherapeutic adherence and controllability. In a 10-day field study, SSAG\ndemonstrated performance comparable to full script alignment and outperformed\nrule-based chatbots, empirically supporting SSAG as an efficient approach for\naligning LLMs with domain expertise. Our work advances LLM applications in\npsychotherapy by providing a controllable, adaptable, and scalable solution for\ndigital interventions, reducing reliance on expert effort.

    "abstract": "Adversarial detection is designed to identify and reject maliciously crafted\nadversarial examples(AEs) which are generated to disrupt the classification of\ntarget models.\n  Presently, various input transformation-based methods have been developed on\nadversarial example detection, which typically rely on empirical experience and\nlead to unreliability against new attacks.\n  To address this issue, we propose and conduct a Dynamically Stable System\n(DSS), which can effectively detect the adversarial examples from normal\nexamples according to the stability of input examples.\n  Particularly, in our paper, the generation of adversarial examples is\nconsidered as the perturbation process of a Lyapunov dynamic system, and we\npropose an example stability mechanism, in which a novel control term is added\nin adversarial example generation to ensure that the normal examples can\nachieve dynamic stability while the adversarial examples cannot achieve the\nstability.\n  Then, based on the proposed example stability mechanism, a Dynamically Stable\nSystem (DSS) is proposed, which can utilize the disruption and restoration\nactions to determine the stability of input examples and detect the adversarial\nexamples through changes in the stability of the input examples.\n  In comparison with existing methods in three benchmark datasets(MNIST,\nCIFAR10, and CIFAR100), our evaluation results show that our proposed DSS can\nachieve ROC-AUC values of 99.83%, 97.81% and 94.47%, surpassing the\nstate-of-the-art(SOTA) values of 97.35%, 91.10% and 93.49% in the other 7\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability\nto address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation\nlearning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels\nfor node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This\nmakes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods\ntypically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory\nand perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory\nconsumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and\nmaintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes\nof learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these\nprototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the\ncached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation\nAdaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype,\nreducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate.\nWhen a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant\nprobabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back\ninto the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the\nmodel's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of\ngeneralization error and explore the impact of different distillation\nstrategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis.\nCompared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy\nand forgetting rate. Our code is publicly available on the\nhttps://github.com/Arvin0313/Mecoin-GFSCIL.git .",

    "abstract": "In the past several years there has been an explosion of available models for\nvision-language tasks. Unfortunately, the literature still leaves open a number\nof questions related to best practices in designing and training such models.\nIn this paper we seek to answer several questions related to the pretraining of\nvision-language encoders through meta-analysis. In our first set of\nexperiments, we show that we can save significant compute at no cost to\ndownstream performance, by freezing large parts of vision-language models\nduring pretraining. In our second set of experiments we examine the effect of\nbasing a VL transformer on a vision model versus a text model. Additionally, we\nintroduce a VL modeling platform called Renaissance that we use to conduct all\nof the experiments. This program offers a great deal of flexibility in\ncreating, training and evaluating transformer encoders for VL modeling.

In recent years,\nwith the advent of large-scale datasets, pretrained large language models have\nemerged with new capabilities, including reasoning. However, these models still\nstruggle with long-term, complex reasoning tasks, such as playing chess. Based\non the observation that expert chess players employ a dual approach combining\nlong-term strategic play with short-term tactical play along with language\nexplanation, we propose improving the reasoning capability of large language\nmodels in chess by integrating annotated strategy and tactic. Specifically, we\ncollect a dataset named MATE, which consists of 1 million chess positions with\ncandidate moves annotated by chess experts for strategy and tactics. We\nfinetune the LLaMA-3-8B model and compare it against state-of-the-art\ncommercial language models in the task of selecting better chess moves. Our\nexperiments show that our models perform better than GPT, Claude, and Gemini\nmodels. We find that language explanations can enhance the reasoning capability\nof large language models.",

    ],
    "abstract": "When training deep neural networks, a model's generalization error is often\nobserved to follow a power scaling law dependent both on the model size and the\ndata size. Perhaps the best known example of such scaling laws are for\ntransformer-based large language models, where networks with billions of\nparameters are trained on trillions of tokens of text. Yet, despite sustained\nwidespread interest, a rigorous understanding of why transformer scaling laws\nexist is still missing. To answer this question, we establish novel statistical\nestimation and mathematical approximation theories for transformers when the\ninput data are concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory predicts\na power law between the generalization error and both the training data size\nand the network size for transformers, where the power depends on the intrinsic\ndimension $d$ of the training data. Notably, the constructed model architecture\nis shallow, requiring only logarithmic depth in $d$. By leveraging\nlow-dimensional data structures under a manifold hypothesis, we are able to\nexplain transformer scaling laws in a way which respects the data geometry.\nMoreover, we test our theory with empirical observation by training LLMs on\nnatural language datasets. We find the observed empirical data scaling laws\nclosely agree with our theoretical predictions. Taken together, these results\nrigorously show the intrinsic dimension of data to be a crucial quantity\naffecting transformer scaling laws in both theory and practice.",

    "abstract": "Country instability is a global issue, with unpredictably high levels of\ninstability thwarting socio-economic growth and possibly causing a slew of\nnegative consequences. As a result, uncertainty prediction models for a country\nare becoming increasingly important in the real world, and they are expanding\nto provide more input from 'big data' collections, as well as the\ninterconnectedness of global economies and social networks. This has culminated\nin massive volumes of qualitative data from outlets like television, print,\ndigital, and social media, necessitating the use of artificial intelligence\n(AI) tools like machine learning to make sense of it all and promote predictive\nprecision [1]. The Global Database of Activities, Voice, and Tone (GDELT\nProject) records broadcast, print, and web news in over 100 languages every\nsecond of every day, identifying the people, locations, organisations, counts,\nthemes, outlets, and events that propel our global community and offering a\nfree open platform for computation on the entire world. The main goal of our\nresearch is to investigate how, when our data grows more voluminous and\nfine-grained, we can conduct a more complex methodological analysis of\npolitical conflict. The GDELT dataset, which was released in 2012, is the first\nand potentially the most technologically sophisticated publicly accessible\ndataset on political conflict.",

We propose an algorithm named $\\mathrm{CAESAR}$ for this\nproblem. Our approach is based on computing an approximate optimal offline\nsampling distribution and using the data sampled from it to perform the\nsimultaneous estimation of the policy values. $\\mathrm{CAESAR}$ has two phases.\nIn the first we produce coarse estimates of the visitation distributions of the\ntarget policies at a low order sample complexity rate that scales with\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$. In the second phase, we approximate the\noptimal offline sampling distribution and compute the importance weighting\nratios for all target policies by minimizing a step-wise quadratic loss\nfunction inspired by the DualDICE \\cite{nachum2019dualdice} objective.

    "abstract": "Current Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which\nalter their predictions by adding carefully crafted noise. Since human eyes are\nrobust to such inputs, it is possible that the vulnerability stems from the\nstandard way of processing inputs in one shot by processing every pixel with\nthe same importance. In contrast, neuroscience suggests that the human vision\nsystem can differentiate salient features by (1) switching between multiple\nfixation points (saccades) and (2) processing the surrounding with a\nnon-uniform external resolution (foveation). In this work, we advocate that the\nintegration of such active vision mechanisms into current deep learning systems\ncan offer robustness benefits. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the\ninherent robustness of two active vision methods - GFNet and FALcon - under a\nblack box threat model. By learning and inferencing based on downsampled\nglimpses obtained from multiple distinct fixation points within an input, we\nshow that these active methods achieve (2-3) times greater robustness compared\nto a standard passive convolutional network under state-of-the-art adversarial\nattacks. More importantly, we provide illustrative and interpretable\nvisualization analysis that demonstrates how performing inference from distinct\nfixation points makes active vision methods less vulnerable to malicious\ninputs.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened up exciting\npossibilities for simulating human behavior and cognitive processes, with\npotential applications in various domains, including marketing research and\nconsumer behavior analysis. However, the validity of utilizing LLMs as\nstand-ins for human subjects remains uncertain due to glaring divergences that\nsuggest fundamentally different underlying processes at play and the\nsensitivity of LLM responses to prompt variations. This paper presents a novel\napproach based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory to interpret LLM\nbehavior and quantify the relative contribution of each prompt component to the\nmodel's output. Through two applications - a discrete choice experiment and an\ninvestigation of cognitive biases - we demonstrate how the Shapley value method\ncan uncover what we term \"token noise\" effects, a phenomenon where LLM\ndecisions are disproportionately influenced by tokens providing minimal\ninformative content. This phenomenon raises concerns about the robustness and\ngeneralizability of insights obtained from LLMs in the context of human\nbehavior simulation. Our model-agnostic approach extends its utility to\nproprietary LLMs, providing a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers\nto strategically optimize prompts and mitigate apparent cognitive biases. Our\nfindings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors\ndriving LLM responses before relying on them as substitutes for human subjects\nin survey settings. We emphasize the importance of researchers reporting\nresults conditioned on specific prompt templates and exercising caution when\ndrawing parallels between human behavior and LLMs.",

An increase in herd size skews the cow-to-human\nratio at the farm and makes the manual monitoring of individuals more\nchallenging. Therefore, real-time cattle identification is essential for the\nfarms and a crucial step towards precision livestock farming. Underpinned by\nour previous work, this paper introduces a deep-metric learning method for\ncattle identification using depth data from an off-the-shelf 3D camera. The\nmethod relies on CNN and MLP backbones that learn well-generalised embedding\nspaces from the body shape to differentiate individuals -- requiring neither\nspecies-specific coat patterns nor close-up muzzle prints for operation. The\nnetwork embeddings are clustered using a simple algorithm such as $k$-NN for\nhighly accurate identification, thus eliminating the need to retrain the\nnetwork for enrolling new individuals. We evaluate two backbone architectures,\nResNet, as previously used to identify Holstein Friesians using RGB images, and\nPointNet, which is specialised to operate on 3D point clouds. We also present\nCowDepth2023, a new dataset containing 21,490 synchronised colour-depth image\npairs of 99 cows, to evaluate the backbones. Both ResNet and PointNet\narchitectures, which consume depth maps and point clouds, respectively, led to\nhigh accuracy that is on par with the coat pattern-based backbone.",

    "abstract": "Modern database systems rely on cost-based query optimizers to come up with\ngood execution plans for input queries. Such query optimizers rely on cost\nmodels to estimate the costs of candidate query execution plans. A cost model\nrepresents a function from a set of cost units to query execution cost, where\neach cost unit specifies the unit cost of executing a certain type of query\nprocessing operation (such as table scan or join). These cost units are\ntraditionally viewed as constants, whose values only depend on the platform\nconfiguration where the database system runs on top of but are invariant for\nqueries processed by the database system. In this paper, we challenge this\nclassic view by thinking of these cost units as variables instead. We show\nthat, by varying the cost-unit values one can obtain query plans that\nsignificantly outperform the default query plans returned by the query\noptimizer when viewing the cost units as constants. We term this cost-unit\ntuning process \"query tuning\" (QT) and show that it is similar to the\nwell-known hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) problem in AutoML. As a result,\nany state-of-the-art HPO technologies can be applied to QT. We study the QT\nproblem in the context of anytime tuning, which is desirable in practice by\nconstraining the total time spent on QT within a given budget -- we call this\nproblem budget-aware query tuning. We further extend our study from tuning a\nsingle query to tuning a workload with multiple queries, and we call this\ngeneralized problem budget-aware workload tuning (WT), which aims for\nminimizing the execution time of the entire workload. WT is more challenging as\none needs to further prioritize individual query tuning within the given time\nbudget. We propose solutions to both QT and WT and experimental evaluation\nusing both benchmark and real workloads demonstrates the efficacy of our\nproposed solutions.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals play a pivotal role in cardiovascular\ndiagnostics, providing essential information on the electrical activity of the\nheart. However, the inherent noise and limited resolution in ECG recordings can\nhinder accurate interpretation and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmodel for ECG super resolution (SR) that uses a DNAE to enhance temporal and\nfrequency information inside ECG signals. Our approach addresses the\nlimitations of traditional ECG signal processing techniques. Our model takes in\ninput 5-second length ECG windows sampled at 50 Hz (very low resolution) and it\nis able to reconstruct a denoised super-resolution signal with an x10\nupsampling rate (sampled at 500 Hz). We trained the proposed DCAE-SR on public\navailable myocardial infraction ECG signals. Our method demonstrates superior\nperformance in reconstructing high-resolution ECG signals from very\nlow-resolution signals with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. We compared our results\nwith the current deep-learning literature approaches for ECG super-resolution\nand some non-deep learning reproducible methods that can perform both\nsuper-resolution and denoising. We obtained current state-of-the-art\nperformances in super-resolution of very low resolution ECG signals frequently\ncorrupted by ECG artifacts. We were able to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio of\n12.20 dB (outperforms previous 4.68 dB), mean squared error of 0.0044\n(outperforms previous 0.0154) and root mean squared error of 4.86% (outperforms\nprevious 12.40%). In conclusion, our DCAE-SR model offers a robust (to artefact\npresence), versatile and explainable solution to enhance the quality of ECG\nsignals. This advancement holds promise in advancing the field of\ncardiovascular diagnostics, paving the way for improved patient care and\nhigh-quality clinical decisions",

We propose a\nperturbation model that allows changes in the transition kernel densities up to\na given multiplicative factor or its reciprocal, extending the classic marginal\nsensitivity model (MSM) for single time-step decision-making to\ninfinite-horizon RL. We characterize the sharp bounds on policy value under\nthis model $\\unicode{x2013}$ $\\textit{i.e.}$, the tightest possible bounds\nbased on transition observations from the original MDP $\\unicode{x2013}$ and we\nstudy the estimation of these bounds from such transition observations. We\ndevelop an estimator with several important guarantees: it is\nsemiparametrically efficient, and remains so even when certain necessary\nnuisance functions, such as worst-case Q-functions, are estimated at slow,\nnonparametric rates. Our estimator is also asymptotically normal, enabling\nstraightforward statistical inference using Wald confidence intervals.\nMoreover, when certain nuisances are estimated inconsistently, the estimator\nstill provides valid, albeit possibly not sharp, bounds on the policy value.

Our experiments reveal that even\nmost LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks,\nstruggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of\ntrustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked.

Some attribute the failures to training data scarcity or their\nreceptive field requirements of large objects. In this paper, we highlight this\nunderstudied problem of generalization to large objects. We find that modern\nfrontal detectors struggle to generalize to large objects even on nearly\nbalanced datasets. We argue that the cause of failure is the sensitivity of\ndepth regression losses to noise of larger objects. To bridge this gap, we\ncomprehensively investigate regression and dice losses, examining their\nrobustness under varying error levels and object sizes. We mathematically prove\nthat the dice loss leads to superior noise-robustness and model convergence for\nlarge objects compared to regression losses for a simplified case.

SeaBird effectively\nintegrates BEV segmentation on foreground objects for 3D detection, with the\nsegmentation head trained with the dice loss.

Machine learning (ML) approaches that learn policies\nfor each agent are appealing as these could enable decentralized systems and\nscale well while maintaining good solution quality. Current ML approaches to\nMAPF have proposed methods that have started to scratch the surface of this\npotential.

We show several model-agnostic ways\nto use heuristic search with learnt policies that significantly improve the\npolicies' success rates and scalability.

Our\nanalysis also uncovers the challenges of ensuring that LLM-generated\nsuggestions are pertinent and useful, emphasizing the need for further research\nin this area.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal data fusion is essential for applications requiring the\nintegration of diverse data sources, especially in the presence of incomplete\nor sparsely available modalities. This paper presents a comparative study of\nthree multimodal embedding techniques, Modal Channel Attention (MCA), Zorro,\nand Everything at Once (EAO), to evaluate their performance on sparsely\nmultimodal data. MCA introduces fusion embeddings for all combinations of input\nmodalities and uses attention masking to create distinct attention channels,\nenabling flexible and efficient data fusion. Experiments on two datasets with\nfour modalities each, CMU-MOSEI and TCGA, demonstrate that MCA outperforms\nZorro across ranking, recall, regression, and classification tasks and\noutperforms EAO across regression and classification tasks. MCA achieves\nsuperior performance by maintaining robust uniformity across unimodal and\nfusion embeddings. While EAO performs best in ranking metrics due to its\napproach of forming fusion embeddings post-inference, it underperforms in\ndownstream tasks requiring multimodal interactions. These results highlight the\nimportance of contrasting all modality combinations in constructing embedding\nspaces and offers insights into the design of multimodal architectures for\nreal-world applications with incomplete data.",

Our experiments\nwith 12 long-context LLMs on ELITR-Bench confirm the progress made across\nsuccessive generations of both proprietary and open models, and point out their\ndiscrepancies in terms of robustness to transcript noise.

Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a\nmodel designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an\nenhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor.

It is organized\nin three parts, where I discuss respectively: estimation, risk preference, and\npotential failures. The first part provides a brief review of the key\napproaches to estimating the reward (or value) function and optimal policy\nwithin this context of analysis. Here, I delineate the identification\nassumptions and statistical properties related to offline optimal policy\nlearning estimators. In the second part, I delve into the analysis of decision\nrisk. This analysis reveals that the optimal choice can be influenced by the\ndecision maker's attitude towards risks, specifically in terms of the trade-off\nbetween reward conditional mean and conditional variance. Here, I present an\napplication of the proposed model to real data, illustrating that the average\nregret of a policy with multi-valued treatment is contingent on the\ndecision-maker's attitude towards risk. The third part of the paper discusses\nthe limitations of optimal data-driven decision-making by highlighting\nconditions under which decision-making can falter.

To support the recovery of patients,\nthe use of fully implanted devices is emerging as one of the most promising\nsolutions. However, these devices, even if becoming an integral part of a fully\ncomplex neural nanonetwork system, pose numerous challenges. In this article,\nwe address one of them, which consists of the classification of motor/sensory\nstimuli. The task is performed by exploring four different types of artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) to extract various sensory stimuli from the\nelectroneurographic (ENG) signal measured in the sciatic nerve of rats.\nDifferent sizes of the data sets are considered to analyze the feasibility of\nthe investigated ANNs for real-time classification through a comparison of\ntheir performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and prediction time. The\ndesign of the ANNs takes advantage of the modelling of the ENG signal as a\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system to describe the measures taken by\nstate-of-the-art implanted nerve interfaces. These are based on the use of\nmulti-contact cuff electrodes to achieve nanoscale spatial discrimination of\nthe nerve activity. The MIMO ENG signal model is another contribution of this\npaper. Our results show that some ANNs are more suitable for real-time\napplications, being capable of achieving accuracies over $90\\%$ for signal\nwindows of $100$ and $200\\,$ms with a low enough processing time to be\neffective for pathology recovery.",

    "abstract": "Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a critical research\ndomain in activity perception. However, achieving high efficiency and long\nsequence recognition remains a challenge. Despite the extensive investigation\nof temporal deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers, their\nextensive parameters often pose significant computational and memory\nconstraints, rendering them less suitable for resource-constrained mobile\nhealth applications. This study introduces HARMamba, an innovative light-weight\nand versatile HAR architecture that combines selective bidirectional State\nSpaces Model and hardware-aware design. To optimize real-time resource\nconsumption in practical scenarios, HARMamba employs linear recursive\nmechanisms and parameter discretization, allowing it to selectively focus on\nrelevant input sequences while efficiently fusing scan and recompute\noperations. The model employs independent channels to process sensor data\nstreams, dividing each channel into patches and appending classification tokens\nto the end of the sequence. It utilizes position embedding to represent the\nsequence order. The patch sequence is subsequently processed by HARMamba Block,\nand the classification head finally outputs the activity category. The HARMamba\nBlock serves as the fundamental component of the HARMamba architecture,\nenabling the effective capture of more discriminative activity sequence\nfeatures. HARMamba outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks,\ndelivering comparable or better accuracy with significantly reducing\ncomputational and memory demands. It's effectiveness has been extensively\nvalidated on 4 publically available datasets namely PAMAP2, WISDM, UNIMIB SHAR\nand UCI. The F1 scores of HARMamba on the four datasets are 99.74%, 99.20%,\n88.23% and 97.01%, respectively.",

To achieve this, we propose\nTFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods.

To remove biases against some methods, we include a\ndiverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and\ndeep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies\nand metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To\nsupport the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair\ncomparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates\nbiases.

    "abstract": "The demand for inference on extremely large scale LLMs has seen enormous\ngrowth in the recent months. It made evident the colossal shortage of dedicated\nhardware capable of efficient and fast processing of the involved compute and\nmemory movement. The problem is aggravated by the exploding raise in the\nlengths of the sequences being processed, since those require efficient on-chip\nstorage of the KV-cache of size proportional to the sequence length. To make\nthe required compute feasible and fit the involved data into available memory,\nnumerous quantization techniques have been proposed that allow accurate\nquantization for both weights and activations. One of the main recent\nbreakthroughs in this direction was introduction of the family of Block\nFloating Point (BFP) formats characterized by a block of mantissas with a\nshared scale factor. These enable memory- power-, and compute- efficient\nhardware support of the tensor operations and provide extremely good\nquantization accuracy. The main issues preventing widespread application of\nblock formats is caused by the presence of outliers in weights and activations\nsince those affect the accuracy of the other values in the same block. In this\npaper, we focus on the most critical problem of limited KV-cache storage. We\npropose a novel approach enabling usage of low precision BFP formats without\ncompromising the resulting model accuracy. We exploit the common channel-wise\npatterns exhibited by the outliers to rearrange them in such a way, that their\nquantization quality is significantly improved. The methodology yields 2x\nsavings in the memory footprint without significant degradation of the model's\naccuracy. Importantly, the rearrangement of channels happens at the compile\ntime and thus has no impact on the inference latency.",

However, they have not been\napplied so far to social inclusion of elderly people, who are particularly\nvulnerable to the digital divide. Many of them relieve their loneliness with\ntraditional media such as TV and radio, which are known to create a feeling of\ncompanionship. In this paper we present the EBER chatbot, designed to reduce\nthe digital gap for the elderly. EBER reads news in the background and adapts\nits responses to the user's mood. Its novelty lies in the concept of\n\"intelligent radio\", according to which, instead of simplifying a digital\ninformation system to make it accessible to the elderly, a traditional channel\nthey find familiar -- background news -- is augmented with interactions via\nvoice dialogues. We make it possible by combining Artificial Intelligence\nModelling Language, automatic Natural Language Generation and Sentiment\nAnalysis. The system allows accessing digital content of interest by combining\nwords extracted from user answers to chatbot questions with keywords extracted\nfrom the news items. This approach permits defining metrics of the abstraction\ncapabilities of the users depending on a spatial representation of the word\nspace.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the development\nof Large Language Models (LLMs). While their practical applications are now\nwidespread, their potential for misuse, such as generating fake news and\ncommitting plagiarism, has posed significant concerns. To address this issue,\ndetectors have been developed to evaluate whether a given text is\nhuman-generated or AI-generated. Among others, zero-shot detectors stand out as\neffective approaches that do not require additional training data and are often\nlikelihood-based. In chat-based applications, users commonly input prompts and\nutilize the AI-generated texts. However, zero-shot detectors typically analyze\nthese texts in isolation, neglecting the impact of the original prompts. It is\nconceivable that this approach may lead to a discrepancy in likelihood\nassessments between the text generation phase and the detection phase. So far,\nthere remains an unverified gap concerning how the presence or absence of\nprompts impacts detection accuracy for zero-shot detectors. In this paper, we\nintroduce an evaluative framework to empirically analyze the impact of prompts\non the detection accuracy of AI-generated text. We assess various zero-shot\ndetectors using both white-box detection, which leverages the prompt, and\nblack-box detection, which operates without prompt information. Our experiments\nreveal the significant influence of prompts on detection accuracy. Remarkably,\ncompared with black-box detection without prompts, the white-box methods using\nprompts demonstrate an increase in AUC of at least $0.1$ across all zero-shot\ndetectors tested.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have\nbeen employed for $de~novo$ molecular generation in drug discovery. Most prior\nstudies have utilized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly\nMonte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to handle the discrete nature of molecular\nrepresentations in GANs. However, due to the inherent instability in training\nGANs and RL models, along with the high computational cost associated with MCTS\nsampling, MCTS RL-based GANs struggle to scale to large chemical databases. To\ntackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel GAN based on\nactor-critic RL with instant and global rewards, called InstGAN, to generate\nmolecules at the token-level with multi-property optimization. Furthermore,\nmaximized information entropy is leveraged to alleviate the mode collapse. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that InstGAN outperforms other baselines,\nachieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, and efficiently\ngenerates molecules with multi-property optimization.

Therefore, current technological solutions are\nnot accessible for all patients with different financial backgrounds. Toward\nthis, we propose a low-cost technological solution called MindArm, an\naffordable, non-invasive neuro-driven prosthetic arm system. MindArm employs a\ndeep neural network (DNN) to translate brain signals, captured by low-cost\nsurface electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes, into prosthetic arm movements.\nUtilizing an Open Brain Computer Interface and UDP networking for signal\nprocessing, the system seamlessly controls arm motion. In the compute module,\nwe run a trained DNN model to interpret filtered micro-voltage brain signals,\nand then translate them into a prosthetic arm action via serial communication\nseamlessly. Experimental results from a fully functional prototype show high\naccuracy across three actions, with 91% for idle/stationary, 85% for handshake,\nand 84% for cup pickup. The system costs approximately $500-550, including $400\nfor the EEG headset and $100-150 for motors, 3D printing, and assembly,\noffering an affordable alternative for mind-controlled prosthetic devices.",

The proposed method involves slightly\ndetaching the peg from the wall, when moving between search positions, to avoid\nthe negative influence of the concrete's high friction coefficient. It uses a\ndeep neural network (DNN), trained via reinforcement learning, to effectively\nfind holes with variable shape and surface finish (due to the brittle nature of\nconcrete) without analytical modeling or control parameter tuning. The method\nuses displacement of the peg toward the wall surface, in addition to force and\ntorque, as one of the inputs of the DNN. Since the displacement increases as\nthe peg gets closer to the hole (due to the chamfered shape of holes in\nconcrete), it is a useful parameter for inputting in the DNN. The proposed\nmethod was evaluated by training the DNN on a hole 500 times and attempting to\nfind 12 unknown holes. The results of the evaluation show the DNN enabled a\nrobot to find the unknown holes with average success rate of 96.1% and average\nexecution time of 12.5 seconds. Additional evaluations with random initial\npositions and a different type of peg demonstrate the trained DNN can\ngeneralize well to different conditions.

    "abstract": "Large language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently achieved\nastonishing performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose MANGO, a benchmark to evaluate their capabilities to\nperform text-based mapping and navigation. Our benchmark includes 53 mazes\ntaken from a suite of textgames: each maze is paired with a walkthrough that\nvisits every location but does not cover all possible paths. The task is\nquestion-answering: for each maze, a large language model reads the walkthrough\nand answers hundreds of mapping and navigation questions such as \"How should\nyou go to Attic from West of House?\" and \"Where are we if we go north and east\nfrom Cellar?\". Although these questions are easy to humans, it turns out that\neven GPT-4, the best-to-date language model, performs poorly at answering them.\nFurther, our experiments suggest that a strong mapping and navigation ability\nwould benefit large language models in performing relevant downstream tasks,\nsuch as playing textgames. Our MANGO benchmark will facilitate future research\non methods that improve the mapping and navigation capabilities of language\nmodels. We host our leaderboard, data, code, and evaluation program at\nhttps://mango.ttic.edu and https://github.com/oaklight/mango/.",

    "abstract": "Node classification on graphs is of great importance in many applications.\nDue to the limited labeling capability and evolution in real-world open\nscenarios, novel classes can emerge on unlabeled testing nodes. However, little\nattention has been paid to novel class discovery on graphs. Discovering novel\nclasses is challenging as novel and known class nodes are correlated by edges,\nwhich makes their representations indistinguishable when applying message\npassing GNNs. Furthermore, the novel classes lack labeling information to guide\nthe learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel method Open-world gRAph\nneuraL network (ORAL) to tackle these challenges. ORAL first detects\ncorrelations between classes through semi-supervised prototypical learning.\nInter-class correlations are subsequently eliminated by the prototypical\nattention network, leading to distinctive representations for different\nclasses. Furthermore, to fully explore multi-scale graph features for\nalleviating label deficiencies, ORAL generates pseudo-labels by aligning and\nensembling label estimations from multiple stacked prototypical attention\nnetworks. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.",

While LLMs provide summarization capabilities, their performance in\ncomplex, real-world scenarios remains under-explored. Our first contribution is\nLogicSumm, an innovative evaluation framework incorporating realistic scenarios\nto assess LLM robustness during RAG-based summarization. Based on limitations\nidentified by LogiSumm, we then developed SummRAG, a comprehensive system to\ncreate training dialogues and fine-tune a model to enhance robustness within\nLogicSumm's scenarios. SummRAG is an example of our goal of defining structured\nmethods to test the capabilities of an LLM, rather than addressing issues in a\none-off fashion. Experimental results confirm the power of SummRAG, showcasing\nimproved logical coherence and summarization quality. Data, corresponding model\nweights, and Python code are available online.",

    "abstract": "Audio-based machine learning systems frequently use public or third-party\ndata, which might be inaccurate. This exposes deep neural network (DNN) models\ntrained on such data to potential data poisoning attacks. In this type of\nassault, attackers can train the DNN model using poisoned data, potentially\ndegrading its performance. Another type of data poisoning attack that is\nextremely relevant to our investigation is label flipping, in which the\nattacker manipulates the labels for a subset of data. It has been demonstrated\nthat these assaults may drastically reduce system performance, even for\nattackers with minimal abilities. In this study, we propose a backdoor attack\nnamed 'DirtyFlipping', which uses dirty label techniques, \"label-on-label\", to\ninput triggers (clapping) in the selected data patterns associated with the\ntarget class, thereby enabling a stealthy backdoor.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to\ntheir data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in\nthese architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size,\nlimiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts\nto design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional\ndata, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either\ndata independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication.\nRecently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State\nSpace Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown\npromising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of\nSSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights\nthat uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called\nSelective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a\nweighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early\nfeatures. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time\nSeries MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and\nexplore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks.\nOur results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and\nchannels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established\nvision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series\nforecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These\nresults show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are\nsufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is\nnecessary.",

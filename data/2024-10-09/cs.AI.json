      "abstract": "Can large language models (LLMs) directly serve as powerful world models for\nmodel-based agents? While the gaps between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the\nspecified environment's dynamics do exist, our study reveals that the gaps can\nbe bridged by aligning an LLM with its deployed environment and such \"world\nalignment\" can be efficiently achieved by rule learning on LLMs. Given the rich\nprior knowledge of LLMs, only a few additional rules suffice to align LLM\npredictions with the specified environment dynamics. To this end, we propose a\nneurosymbolic approach to learn these rules gradient-free through LLMs, by\ninducing, updating, and pruning rules based on comparisons of agent-explored\ntrajectories and world model predictions. The resulting world model is composed\nof the LLM and the learned rules. Our embodied LLM agent \"WALL-E\" is built upon\nmodel-predictive control (MPC). By optimizing look-ahead actions based on the\nprecise world model, MPC significantly improves exploration and learning\nefficiency. Compared to existing LLM agents, WALL-E's reasoning only requires a\nfew principal rules rather than verbose buffered trajectories being included in\nthe LLM input. On open-world challenges in Minecraft and ALFWorld, WALL-E\nachieves higher success rates than existing methods, with lower costs on\nreplanning time and the number of tokens used for reasoning. In Minecraft,\nWALL-E exceeds baselines by 15-30% in success rate while costing 8-20 fewer\nreplanning rounds and only 60-80% of tokens. In ALFWorld, its success rate\nsurges to a new record high of 95% only after 6 iterations.",

      "abstract": "Despite tremendous progress in developing deep-learning-based weather\nforecasting systems, their design space, including the impact of different\ndesign choices, is yet to be well understood. This paper aims to fill this\nknowledge gap by systematically analyzing these choices including architecture,\nproblem formulation, pretraining scheme, use of image-based pretrained models,\nloss functions, noise injection, multi-step inputs, additional static masks,\nmulti-step finetuning (including larger stride models), as well as training on\na larger dataset. We study fixed-grid architectures such as UNet, fully\nconvolutional architectures, and transformer-based models, along with\ngrid-invariant architectures, including graph-based and operator-based models.\nOur results show that fixed-grid architectures outperform grid-invariant\narchitectures, indicating a need for further architectural developments in\ngrid-invariant models such as neural operators. We therefore propose a hybrid\nsystem that combines the strong performance of fixed-grid models with the\nflexibility of grid-invariant architectures. We further show that multi-step\nfine-tuning is essential for most deep-learning models to work well in\npractice, which has been a common practice in the past. Pretraining objectives\ndegrade performance in comparison to supervised training, while image-based\npretrained models provide useful inductive biases in some cases in comparison\nto training the model from scratch. Interestingly, we see a strong positive\neffect of using a larger dataset when training a smaller model as compared to\ntraining on a smaller dataset for longer. Larger models, on the other hand,\nprimarily benefit from just an increase in the computational budget. We believe\nthat these results will aid in the design of better weather forecasting systems\nin the future.",

      "abstract": "Foundational models are able to generate text outputs given prompt\ninstructions and text, audio, or image inputs. Recently these models have been\ncombined to perform tasks on video, such as video summarization. Such video\nfoundation models perform pre-training by aligning outputs from each\nmodality-specific model into the same embedding space. Then the embeddings from\neach model are used within a language model, which is fine-tuned on a desired\ninstruction set. Aligning each modality during pre-training is computationally\nexpensive and prevents rapid testing of different base modality models. During\nfine-tuning, evaluation is carried out within in-domain videos where it is hard\nto understand the generalizability and data efficiency of these methods. To\nalleviate these issues we propose a plug-and-play video language model. It\ndirectly uses the texts generated from each input modality into the language\nmodel, avoiding pre-training alignment overhead. Instead of fine-tuning we\nleverage few-shot instruction adaptation strategies. We compare the performance\nversus the computational costs for our plug-and-play style method and baseline\ntuning methods. Finally, we explore the generalizability of each method during\ndomain shift and present insights on what data is useful when training data is\nlimited. Through this analysis, we present practical insights on how to\nleverage multi-modal foundational models for effective results given realistic\ncompute and data limitations.",

      "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a widely used technique in the\nbiomedical field for measuring the decay times of fluorescent molecules,\nproviding insights into metabolic states, protein interactions, and\nligand-receptor bindings. However, its broader application in fast biological\nprocesses, such as dynamic activity monitoring, and clinical use, such as in\nguided surgery, is limited by long data acquisition times and computationally\ndemanding data processing. While deep learning has reduced post-processing\ntimes, time-resolved data acquisition remains a bottleneck for real-time\napplications. To address this, we propose a method to achieve real-time FLI\nusing an FPGA-based hardware accelerator. Specifically, we implemented a\nGRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model on an FPGA board compatible with\ntime-resolved cameras. The GRU model balances accurate processing with the\nresource constraints of FPGAs, which have limited DSP units and BRAM. The\nlimited memory and computational resources on the FPGA require efficient\nscheduling of operations and memory allocation to deploy deep learning models\nfor low-latency applications. We address these challenges by using STOMP, a\nqueue-based discrete-event simulator that automates and optimizes task\nscheduling and memory management on hardware. By integrating a GRU-based\nSeq2Seq model and its compressed version, called Seq2SeqLite, generated through\nknowledge distillation, we were able to process multiple pixels in parallel,\nreducing latency compared to sequential processing. We explore various levels\nof parallelism to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource\nutilization. Our results indicate that the proposed techniques achieved a 17.7x\nand 52.0x speedup over manual scheduling for the Seq2Seq model and the\nSeq2SeqLite model, respectively.",

To achieve this, we propose\nMoE++, a general and heterogeneous MoE framework that integrates both\nFeed-Forward Network~(FFN) and zero-computation experts. Specifically, we\nintroduce three types of zero-computation experts: the zero expert, copy\nexpert, and constant expert, which correspond to discard, skip, and replace\noperations, respectively. This design offers three key advantages: (i) Low\nComputing Overhead: Unlike the uniform mixing mechanism for all tokens within\nvanilla MoE, MoE++ allows each token to engage with a dynamic number of FFNs,\nbe adjusted by constant vectors, or even skip the MoE layer entirely. (ii) High\nPerformance: By enabling simple tokens to utilize fewer FFN experts, MoE++\nallows more experts to focus on challenging tokens, thereby unlocking greater\nperformance potential than vanilla MoE. (iii) Deployment Friendly: Given that\nzero-computation experts have negligible parameters, we can deploy all\nzero-computation experts on each GPU, eliminating the significant communication\noverhead and expert load imbalance associated with FFN experts distributed\nacross different GPUs. Moreover, we leverage gating residuals, enabling each\ntoken to consider the pathway taken in the previous layer when selecting the\nappropriate experts.

Still, finding an effective metric is\ncrucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase.\nMetrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning\nmodels, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this\npaper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model,\npre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through\nadditional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples.

Extensive experiments on different image and video\ndatasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for\nthe task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations. Furthermore, we\nshow that integrating PAC-S++ into the fine-tuning stage of a captioning model\nresults in semantically richer captions with fewer repetitions and grammatical\nerrors.

We find that\nimperfect retrieval augmentation might be inevitable and quite harmful, through\ncontrolled analysis under realistic conditions.

Our experiments\nusing Gemini and Claude demonstrate that Astute RAG significantly outperforms\nprevious robustness-enhanced RAG methods.

      "abstract": "Learning-based approaches to quadruped locomotion commonly adopt generic\npolicy architectures like fully connected MLPs. As such architectures contain\nfew inductive biases, it is common in practice to incorporate priors in the\nform of rewards, training curricula, imitation data, or trajectory generators.\nIn nature, animals are born with priors in the form of their nervous system's\narchitecture, which has been shaped by evolution to confer innate ability and\nefficient learning. For instance, a horse can walk within hours of birth and\ncan quickly improve with practice. Such architectural priors can also be useful\nin ANN architectures for AI. In this work, we explore the advantages of a\nbiologically inspired ANN architecture for quadruped locomotion based on neural\ncircuits in the limbs and spinal cord of mammals. Our architecture achieves\ngood initial performance and comparable final performance to MLPs, while using\nless data and orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our architecture also\nexhibits better generalization to task variations, even admitting deployment on\na physical robot without standard sim-to-real methods. This work shows that\nneural circuits can provide valuable architectural priors for locomotion and\nencourages future work in other sensorimotor skills.",

      "abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then\nfine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful\nand most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights\nvia a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are\nusually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across the model\nweights. Recent works focus on different initialization schemes or the learning\nof adaptive ranks during fine-tuning. Both approaches have only been\ninvestigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank\ndistribution, in turn leading to suboptimal performance. We propose to improve\nLoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) on minibatches of activation vectors. Then,\nwe initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and\nredistribute ranks among all weight matrices to provably store the maximum\namount of information of the downstream data in the newly introduced weights.\nIn this way, only what information to maintain or neglect during the\nfine-tuning process needs to be learned. We call our new method\n$\\textbf{E}$xplained $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{A}$daptation (EVA). We apply\nEVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and\nunderstanding to image classification and reinforcement learning.

To address these limitations, we propose a\ngeneralized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the\nformalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of\nLLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of\nembodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended\ngoals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal\ninterpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition\nmodeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down\nevaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors,\naffordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our\nbenchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different\nsubtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI\nsystems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in\nembodied decision making.",

      "abstract": "This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning,\naiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful\ncontent) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for\nunlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient\nascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse\nthe learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e.,\ndeviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and\npotential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been\nproposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art\nLLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another\ncritical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference\nmodel (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success,\nwhich can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven\nallocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty\nlevels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of\nunlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet\neffective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that\n`simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of\nsimple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights\ninto SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov\nchains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks\nlike TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks.

For\nexample, therapists might try to shift the conversation's direction to keep the\ntherapeutic process on track and avoid stagnation, or patients might push the\ndiscussion towards issues they want to focus on.\n  How do such patient and therapist redirections relate to the development and\nquality of their relationship? To answer this question, we introduce a\nprobabilistic measure of the extent to which a certain utterance immediately\nredirects the flow of the conversation, accounting for both the intention and\nthe actual realization of such a change. We apply this new measure to\ncharacterize the development of patient-therapist relationships over multiple\nsessions in a very large, widely-used online therapy platform. Our analysis\nreveals that (1) patient control of the conversation's direction generally\nincreases relative to that of the therapist as their relationship progresses;\nand (2) patients who have less control in the first few sessions are\nsignificantly more likely to eventually express dissatisfaction with their\ntherapist and terminate the relationship.",

      "abstract": "One essential advantage of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) over\ntransformer-based language models is their linear computational complexity\nconcerning the sequence length, which makes them much faster in handling long\nsequences during inference. However, most publicly available RNNs (e.g., Mamba\nand RWKV) are trained on sequences with less than 10K tokens, and their\neffectiveness in longer contexts remains largely unsatisfying so far. In this\npaper, we study the cause of the inability to process long context for RNNs and\nsuggest critical mitigations. We examine two practical concerns when applying\nstate-of-the-art RNNs to long contexts: (1) the inability to extrapolate to\ninputs longer than the training length and (2) the upper bound of memory\ncapacity. Addressing the first concern, we first investigate *state collapse*\n(SC), a phenomenon that causes severe performance degradation on sequence\nlengths not encountered during training. With controlled experiments, we\nattribute this to overfitting due to the recurrent state being\noverparameterized for the training length. For the second concern, we train a\nseries of Mamba-2 models on long documents to empirically estimate the\nrecurrent state capacity in language modeling and passkey retrieval. Then,\nthree SC mitigation methods are proposed to improve Mamba-2's length\ngeneralizability, allowing the model to process more than 1M tokens without SC.\nWe also find that the recurrent state capacity in passkey retrieval scales\nexponentially to the state size, and we empirically train a Mamba-2 370M with\nnear-perfect passkey retrieval accuracy on 256K context length. This suggests a\npromising future for RNN-based long-context modeling.",

Achieving high\nwin rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of\nnewly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks,\nsuch as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even\nthough several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle\nstyle to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a \"null model\" that\nalways outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat\nautomatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on\nAlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench.\nMoreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that\nthe instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are\nprivate and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily\nproof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible\ncheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional\nimpact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for\nreliable automatic benchmarks. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/sail-sg/Cheating-LLM-Benchmarks.",

We do so by specifically\nstudying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in\nsimulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve\na specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison).\nLeveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine\nconversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of\nnoteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in\ncarrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are\nat play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful\ninteractions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve\nimpacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with\nrespect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents'\npersonas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood\nof successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social\nbehaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific\npersonalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles.\nThese results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents\nas well as the debate on their societal impact.",

At the core of chatbots are the\nNatural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to\ncomprehend and respond to user queries. Before deploying NLUs, there is a need\nto train them with labeled data. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE\nchatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This\nchallenge arises because training SE chatbots requires specialized vocabulary\nand phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, chatbot\ndevelopers often resort to manually annotating user queries to gather the data\nnecessary for training effective chatbots, a process that is both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive. Previous studies propose approaches to\nsupport chatbot practitioners in annotating users' posed queries. However,\nthese approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling\nfunctions (LFs), that identify and categorize user queries based on specific\npatterns in the data. To address this issue, we propose an approach to\nautomatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the queries of\nfour diverse SE datasets (namely AskGit, MSA, Ask Ubuntu, and Stack Overflow)\nand measure the performance improvement gained from training the NLU on the\nqueries labeled by the generated LFs. We find that the generated LFs\neffectively label data with AUC scores of up to 85.3%, and NLU's performance\nimprovement of up to 27.2% across the studied datasets. Furthermore, our\nresults show that the number of LFs used to generate LFs affects the labeling\nperformance.

Additionally,\nthese frameworks lack interpretability and user engagement during the training\nprocess, primarily due to the absence of human-centered design. It leads to a\nlack of transparency in final decision-making and limited user control,\npotentially reducing trust and adoption of AutoML methods. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce UniAutoML, a human-centered AutoML framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to unify AutoML for both discriminative\n(e.g., Transformers and CNNs for classification or regression tasks) and\ngenerative tasks (e.g., fine-tuning diffusion models or LLMs). The\nhuman-centered design of UniAutoML innovatively features a conversational user\ninterface (CUI) that facilitates natural language interactions, providing users\nwith real-time guidance, feedback, and progress updates for better\ninterpretability. This design enhances transparency and user control throughout\nthe AutoML training process, allowing users to seamlessly break down or modify\nthe model being trained. To mitigate potential risks associated with LLM\ngenerated content, UniAutoML incorporates a safety guardline that filters\ninputs and censors outputs. We evaluated UniAutoML's performance and usability\nthrough experiments on eight diverse datasets and user studies involving 25\nparticipants, demonstrating that UniAutoML not only enhances performance but\nalso improves user control and trust.

      "abstract": "Scientific discovery plays a pivotal role in advancing human society, and\nrecent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to\naccelerate this process. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can\nautonomously generate novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given\nonly a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without\nrestriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that\nhypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we\npropose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental\nassumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research\nbackground and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three\npractical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with\ninspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient\nset of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop\nan agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this\nmathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a\nbenchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January\n2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations,\nand hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high\nsimilarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core\ninnovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with\nknowledge cutoff date prior to 2024. Finally, based on LLM's surprisingly high\naccuracy on inspiration retrieval, a task with inherently out-of-distribution\nnature, we propose a bold assumption: that LLMs may already encode latent\nscientific knowledge associations not yet recognized by humans.",

While prevalent in NLP, this\ncapability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nsettings.

Given that complex environments typically lead to long\nepisodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple\nenvironments with short episodes.

The retrieval component in\nRA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We\nevaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics\nsimulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT\noutperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length.\nFurthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on\ncomplex environments and discuss future directions.

This one-to-many mapping\nissue can cause contradictory supervision signals to the network because the\nloss function may produce different values for identical input-output pairs of\nthe network. In many cases, this issue could adversely affect the network\noptimization process. In this work, we propose to enhance the conventional\nlearning objective using a novel completion consistency loss to mitigate the\none-to-many mapping problem.

The proposed consistency loss\nenhances the performance of the point completion network without affecting the\ninference speed, thereby increasing the accuracy of point cloud completion.\nNotably, a state-of-the-art point completion network trained with the proposed\nconsistency loss can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging new\nMVP dataset.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\naddresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the\ninference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant\ncontext, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate\nwhen given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a\nProgramming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code.\nThis approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most\nrelevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning\ntechnique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more\nhallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two\nretrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing\ncontext granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our\nmethod improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels by up to 34% on MBPP.

We assume that we have a\nhigh-level specification and a low-level specification of the agent, both\nrepresented as basic action theories. A refinement mapping specifies how each\nhigh-level action is implemented by a low-level ConGolog program and how each\nhigh-level fluent can be translated into a low-level formula. We define a\nnotion of sound abstraction between such action theories in terms of the\nexistence of a suitable bisimulation between their respective models. Sound\nabstractions have many useful properties that ensure that we can reason about\nthe agent's actions (e.g., executability, projection, and planning) at the\nabstract level, and refine and concretely execute them at the low level. We\nalso characterize the notion of complete abstraction where all actions\n(including exogenous ones) that the high level thinks can happen can in fact\noccur at the low level. To facilitate verifying that one has a sound/complete\nabstraction relative to a mapping, we provide a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. Finally, we identify a set of basic action theory constraints that\nensure that for any low-level action sequence, there is a unique high-level\naction sequence that it refines. This allows us to track/monitor what the\nlow-level agent is doing and describe it in abstract terms (i.e., provide\nhigh-level explanations, for instance, to a client or manager).",

In this paper, we propose a novel Selective Discrete\nCosine Transformation (sDCTFT) fine-tuning scheme to push this frontier. Its\ngeneral idea is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation\nproperties of DCT to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically,\nit projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete\ncosine space.

Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superior accuracy, reduced computational cost, and lower\nstorage requirements of the proposed method over the prior arts. For instance,\nwhen performing instruction tuning on the LLaMA3.1-8B model, sDCTFT outperforms\nLoRA with just 0.05M trainable parameters compared to LoRA's 38.2M, and\nsurpasses FourierFT with 30\\% less trainable parameters.

      "abstract": "Large language models have been successfully applied to programming\nassistance tasks, such as code completion, code insertion, and instructional\ncode editing. However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and\nstruggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the\nprogramming process, including coding history, current code, and user\ninstructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that\ncomprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our\nmodels and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well\nmodels align with different types of information and the quality of their\noutputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to\ncomprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance\ntasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline,\nProgramming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources,\nsuch as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically\ngenerate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally,\nusing this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and\ndevelop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models\nof comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and\nautomated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

Current methods differentiate members and non-members by designing\nscoring functions, like Perplexity and Min-k%. However, the diversity and\ncomplexity of training data magnifies the difficulty of distinguishing, leading\nto suboptimal performance in detecting pretraining data. In this paper, we\nfirst explore the benefits of unseen data, which can be easily collected after\nthe release of the LLM. We find that the perplexities of LLMs shift differently\nfor members and non-members, after fine-tuning with a small amount of\npreviously unseen data. In light of this, we introduce a novel and effective\nmethod termed Fine-tuned Score Deviation(FSD), which improves the performance\nof current scoring functions for pretraining data detection. In particular, we\npropose to measure the deviation distance of current scores after fine-tuning\non a small amount of unseen data within the same domain. In effect, using a few\nunseen data can largely decrease the scores of all non-members, leading to a\nlarger deviation distance than members.

In particular, they are rapidly expanding in domains such as\nchemistry and biology, especially in the areas of drug discovery and molecule\ngeneration. One of the areas witnessing the fasted growth is the chemical\nreactions field, where chemical reactions can be naturally encoded as directed\nhyperedges of a hypergraph. In this paper, we address the chemical reaction\nclassification problem by introducing the notation of a Directed Line Graph\n(DGL) associated with a given directed hypergraph. On top of it, we build the\nDirected Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG\ntransformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the\nDirected Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of\nthe interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph\nthanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many\ndesirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being\npositive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a\nspectral-based GNN.

After\nfour SynPO iterations, Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B show significant enhancements\nin instruction-following abilities, achieving over 22.1% win rate improvements\non AlpacaEval 2.0 and ArenaHard. Simultaneously, SynPO improves the general\nperformance of LLMs on various tasks, validated by a 3.2 to 5.0 average score\nincrease on the well-recognized Open LLM leaderboard.",

      "abstract": "In traditional boosting algorithms, the focus on misclassified training\nsamples emphasizes their importance based on difficulty during the learning\nprocess. While using a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a weak learner\nin an AdaBoost framework can enhance model performance by concentrating on\nerror samples, this approach introduces significant challenges. Specifically,\nSVMs, characterized by their stability and robustness, may require\ndestabilization to fit the boosting paradigm, which in turn can constrain\nperformance due to reliance on the weighted results from preceding iterations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Support Vector Boosting Machine\n(SVBM), which integrates a novel subsampling process with SVM algorithms and\nresidual connection techniques. This method updates sample weights by\nconsidering both the current model's predictions and the outputs from prior\nrounds, allowing for effective sparsity control.

It is not only due to the commendable boost in performance\nthey offer but also its capacity to provide a more lucid rationale for model\nbehaviors, which are often viewed as inscrutable. However, Attention-based GNNs\nhave demonstrated instability in interpretability when subjected to various\nsources of perturbations during both training and testing phases, including\nfactors like additional edges or nodes. In this paper, we propose a solution to\nthis problem by introducing a novel notion called Faithful Graph\nAttention-based Interpretation (FGAI). In particular, FGAI has four crucial\nproperties regarding stability and sensitivity to interpretation and final\noutput distribution. Built upon this notion, we propose an efficient\nmethodology for obtaining FGAI, which can be viewed as an ad hoc modification\nto the canonical Attention-based GNNs. To validate our proposed solution, we\nintroduce two novel metrics tailored for graph interpretation assessment.\nExperimental results demonstrate that FGAI exhibits superior stability and\npreserves the interpretability of attention under various forms of\nperturbations and randomness, which makes FGAI a more faithful and reliable\nexplanation tool.",

Large objects\nrequire mobile manipulation which involves simultaneous manipulation,\nnavigation, and movement with the object in tow. In many real-world situations,\nobject dynamics are incredibly complex, such as the interaction of an office\nchair (with a rotating base and five caster wheels) and the ground. We present\na hierarchical algorithm for long-horizon robot manipulation problems in which\nthe dynamics are partially unknown. We observe that diffusion-based behavior\ncloning is highly effective for short-horizon problems with unknown dynamics,\nso we decompose the problem into an abstract high-level, obstacle-aware\nmotion-planning problem that produces a waypoint sequence. We use a\nshort-horizon, relative-motion diffusion policy to achieve the waypoints in\nsequence. We train mobile manipulation policies on a Spot robot that has to\npush and pull an office chair. Our hierarchical manipulation policy performs\nconsistently better, especially when the horizon increases, compared to a\ndiffusion policy trained on long-horizon demonstrations or motion planning\nassuming a rigidly-attached object (success rate of 8 (versus 0 and 5\nrespectively) out of 10 runs). Importantly, our learned policy generalizes to\nnew layouts, grasps, chairs, and flooring that induces more friction, without\nany further training, showing promise for other complex mobile manipulation\nproblems.

Decisions in this domain are incredibly\ncomplex, involving conflicting entities and evidence. In the last decades,\npolicymakers increasingly use simulations and computational methods to guide\nsome of their decisions. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are one of such\nmethods, which combine social, economic, and environmental simulations to\nforecast potential policy effects. For example, the UN uses outputs of IAMs for\ntheir recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.\nTraditionally these have been solved using recursive equation solvers, but have\nseveral shortcomings, e.g. struggling at decision making under uncertainty.\nRecent preliminary work using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replace the\ntraditional solvers shows promising results in decision making in uncertain and\nnoisy scenarios. We extend on this work by introducing multiple interacting RL\nagents as a preliminary analysis on modelling the complex interplay of\nsocio-interactions between various stakeholders or nations that drives much of\nthe current climate crisis. Our findings show that cooperative agents in this\nframework can consistently chart pathways towards more desirable futures in\nterms of reduced carbon emissions and improved economy. However, upon\nintroducing competition between agents, for instance by using opposing reward\nfunctions, desirable climate futures are rarely reached. Modelling competition\nis key to increased realism in these simulations, as such we employ policy\ninterpretation by visualising what states lead to more uncertain behaviour, to\nunderstand algorithm failure. Finally, we highlight the current limitations and\navenues for further work to ensure future technology uptake for policy\nderivation.",

Furthermore, we apply the latest mathematical tools in information\ntheory to bound the transferability error using complexity and generalization\nterms, contributing to three practical guidelines for reducing transferability\nerror: (1) incorporating more surrogate models, (2) increasing their diversity,\nand (3) reducing their complexity in cases of overfitting.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to security and safety threats,\nsuch as prompt injection, prompt extraction, and harmful requests. One major\ncause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of an instruction hierarchy. Modern\nLLM architectures treat all inputs equally, failing to distinguish between and\nprioritize various types of instructions, such as system messages, user\nprompts, and data. As a result, lower-priority user prompts may override more\ncritical system instructions, including safety protocols. Existing approaches\nto achieving instruction hierarchy, such as delimiters and instruction-based\ntraining, do not address this issue at the architectural level. We introduce\nthe Instructional Segment Embedding (ISE) technique, inspired by BERT, to\nmodern large language models, which embeds instruction priority information\ndirectly into the model. This approach enables models to explicitly\ndifferentiate and prioritize various instruction types, significantly improving\nsafety against malicious prompts that attempt to override priority rules. Our\nexperiments on the Structured Query and Instruction Hierarchy benchmarks\ndemonstrate an average robust accuracy increase of up to 15.75% and 18.68%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we observe an improvement in instruction-following\ncapability of up to 4.1% evaluated on AlpacaEval. Overall, our approach offers\na promising direction for enhancing the safety and effectiveness of LLM\narchitectures.",

The imprecision of these convex\nrelaxations, however, is a major obstacle: even the most precise single-neuron\nrelaxation is incomplete for general ReLU networks, a phenomenon referred to as\nthe single-neuron convex barrier. While heuristic instantiations of\nmulti-neuron relaxations have been proposed to circumvent this barrier in\npractice, their theoretical properties remain largely unknown. In this work, we\nconduct the first rigorous study of the expressiveness of multi-neuron\nrelaxations. We first show that the ``$\\max$'' function in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ can\nbe encoded by a ReLU network and exactly bounded by a multi-neuron relaxation,\nwhich is impossible for any single-neuron relaxation. Further, we prove that\nmulti-neuron relaxations can be turned into complete verifiers by\nsemantic-preserving structural transformations or by input space partitioning\nthat enjoys improved worst-case partition complexity. We also show that without\nthese augmentations, the completeness guarantee can no longer be obtained, and\nthe relaxation error of every multi-neuron relaxation can be unbounded. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an extensive\ncharacterization of multi-neuron relaxations and their expressiveness in neural\nnetwork certification.",

Previous Weight regularizations (e.g., L1\nregularization) typically impose uniform penalties on all parameters, leading\nto a suboptimal tradeoff between model utility and privacy. In this work, we\nfirst show that only a small fraction of parameters substantially impact the\nprivacy risk. In light of this, we propose Privacy-aware Sparsity Tuning\n(PAST), a simple fix to the L1 Regularization, by employing adaptive penalties\nto different parameters. Our key idea behind PAST is to promote sparsity in\nparameters that significantly contribute to privacy leakage. In particular, we\nconstruct the adaptive weight for each parameter based on its privacy\nsensitivity, i.e., the gradient of the loss gap with respect to the parameter.\nUsing PAST, the network shrinks the loss gap between members and non-members,\nleading to strong resistance to privacy attacks.

The trained model\noutperformed the various existing algorithms by achieving the overall F1-score\nof 0.986 for the ten arrhythmia class classification in the MITDB and achieved\nnear perfect prediction scores of ~0.99 for LBBB, RBBB, Premature ventricular\ncontraction beat, Atrial premature beat and Paced beat. Subsequently, the\nmethodology was validated across INCARTDB, EDB and different class groups of\nMITDB using transfer learning. The generalizability test provided F1-scores of\n0.980, 0.946, 0.977, and 0.980 for INCARTDB, EDB, MITDB AAMI, and MITDB Normal\nvs. Abnormal Classification, respectively. Therefore, with a more enhanced and\ncomprehensive understanding of the patient being examined and their ECG for\ndiverse CVD manifestations, the proposed rECGnition_v1.0 algorithm paves the\nway for its deployment in clinics.",

Existing work on\nadaptive systems typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or\nlow-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of\nspecific resources. While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained\ncontrol over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in\ndynamic environments.

Instead of\nmanually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt\nto environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with\nan extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated\nlearning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical\ntestbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications.

We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent\ncharacteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this\nphenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that\nits negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually\nperceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall\nquality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the\ninformation drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy\ninput, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation\ntechniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a\npractical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of\na technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the\nsimplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various\ntasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion\nfeatures.

In general, LVLMs rely\non vision encoders to transform images into visual tokens, which are crucial\nfor the language models to perceive image contents effectively. Therefore, we\nare curious about one question: Can LVLMs still generate correct responses when\nthe encoded visual tokens are attacked and disrupting the visual information?\nTo this end, we propose a non-targeted attack method referred to as VT-Attack\n(Visual Tokens Attack), which constructs adversarial examples from multiple\nperspectives, with the goal of comprehensively disrupting feature\nrepresentations and inherent relationships as well as the semantic properties\nof visual tokens output by image encoders.

Typically, the model parameters are fully shared\nacross multiple timesteps to enhance training efficiency. However, since the\ndenoising tasks differ at each timestep, the gradients computed at different\ntimesteps may conflict, potentially degrading the overall performance of image\ngeneration. To solve this issue, this work proposes a\n\\textbf{De}couple-then-\\textbf{Me}rge (\\textbf{DeMe}) framework, which begins\nwith a pretrained model and finetunes separate models tailored to specific\ntimesteps. We introduce several improved techniques during the finetuning stage\nto promote effective knowledge sharing while minimizing training interference\nacross timesteps. Finally, after finetuning, these separate models can be\nmerged into a single model in the parameter space, ensuring efficient and\npractical inference.

However, existing methods primarily\nconcentrate on modeling the uncertainty associated with RL's random variables,\nneglecting the inherent structure within the state and action spaces.

Under this tree structure, value-conditional\nstructural entropy is defined and maximized to design an intrinsic reward\nmechanism that avoids redundant transitions and promotes enhanced coverage in\nthe state-action space. Theoretical connections are established between SI2E\nand classical information-theoretic methodologies, highlighting our framework's\nrationality and advantage.

      "abstract": "Speech is usually used for constructing an automatic Alzheimer's dementia\n(AD) detection system, as the acoustic and linguistic abilities show a decline\nin people living with AD at the early stages. However, speech includes not only\nAD-related local and global information but also other information unrelated to\ncognitive status, such as age and gender. In this paper, we propose a\nspeech-based system named Swin-BERT for automatic dementia detection. For the\nacoustic part, the shifted windows multi-head attention that proposed to\nextract local and global information from images, is used for designing our\nacoustic-based system. To decouple the effect of age and gender on acoustic\nfeature extraction, they are used as an extra input of the designed acoustic\nsystem. For the linguistic part, the rhythm-related information, which varies\nsignificantly between people living with and without AD, is removed while\ntranscribing the audio recordings into transcripts. To compensate for the\nremoved rhythm-related information, the character-level transcripts are\nproposed to be used as the extra input of a word-level BERT-style system.\nFinally, the Swin-BERT combines the acoustic features learned from our proposed\nacoustic-based system with our linguistic-based system. The experiments are\nbased on the two datasets provided by the international dementia detection\nchallenges: the ADReSS and ADReSSo. The results show that both the proposed\nacoustic and linguistic systems can be better or comparable with previous\nresearch on the two datasets. Superior results are achieved by the proposed\nSwin-BERT system on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets, which are 85.58\\% F-score\nand 87.32\\% F-score respectively.",

However, existing models, predominantly based on deep learning\narchitectures, often perpetuate biases inherent in the training data. This\nraises ethical concerns, depending on the intended application of these agents.\nThis paper addresses these issues by first examining the influence of gender on\nfacial non-verbal behaviors. We concentrate on gaze, head movements, and facial\nexpressions. We introduce a classifier capable of discerning the gender of a\nspeaker from their non-verbal cues. This classifier achieves high accuracy on\nboth real behavior data, extracted using state-of-the-art tools, and synthetic\ndata, generated from a model developed in previous work.Building upon this\nwork, we present a new model, FairGenderGen, which integrates a gender\ndiscriminator and a gradient reversal layer into our previous behavior\ngeneration model. This new model generates facial non-verbal behaviors from\nspeech features, mitigating gender sensitivity in the generated behaviors. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the classifier, developed in the initial phase, is\nno longer effective in distinguishing the gender of the speaker from the\ngenerated non-verbal behaviors.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel lossless compression method for compressing\ngeometric attributes of point cloud data with bits-back coding. Our method\nspecializes in using a deep learning-based probabilistic model to estimate the\nShannon's entropy of the point cloud information, i.e., geometric attributes of\nthe 3D floating points. Once the entropy of the point cloud dataset is\nestimated with a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE), we use the\nlearned CVAE model to compress the geometric attributes of the point clouds\nwith the bits-back coding technique. The novelty of our method with bits-back\ncoding specializes in utilizing the learned latent variable model of the CVAE\nto compress the point cloud data. By using bits-back coding, we can capture the\npotential correlation between the data points, such as similar spatial features\nlike shapes and scattering regions, into the lower-dimensional latent space to\nfurther reduce the compression ratio. The main insight of our method is that we\ncan achieve a competitive compression ratio as conventional deep learning-based\napproaches, while significantly reducing the overhead cost of storage and/or\ncommunicating the compression codec, making our approach more applicable in\npractical scenarios. Throughout comprehensive evaluations, we found that the\ncost for the overhead is significantly small, compared to the reduction of the\ncompression ratio when compressing large point cloud datasets. Experiment\nresults show that our proposed approach can achieve a compression ratio of 1.56\nbit-per-point on average, which is significantly lower than the baseline\napproach such as Google's Draco with a compression ratio of 1.83 bit-per-point.",

Notably, discrete\ndiffusion models with discrete latent codes have shown strong performance,\nparticularly in modalities suited for discrete compressed representations, such\nas image and motion generation.

This paper presents a novel method for addressing linear\ninverse problems by leveraging image-generation models based on discrete\ndiffusion as priors.

Furthermore, we\nemploy a star-shaped noise process to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional\ndiscrete diffusion models with absorbing states, demonstrating that our method\nperforms comparably to continuous diffusion techniques.

      "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a pivotal technique for neural\nnetwork compression and performance enhancement. Most KD methods aim to\ntransfer dark knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight\nstudent model based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss. However, the\nstudent performance improvements achieved through KD exhibit diminishing\nmarginal returns, where a stronger teacher model does not necessarily lead to a\nproportionally stronger student model. To address this issue, we empirically\nfind that the KL-based KD method may implicitly change the inter-class\nrelationships learned by the student model, resulting in a more complex and\nambiguous decision boundary, which in turn reduces the model's accuracy and\ngeneralization ability. Therefore, this study argues that the student model\nshould learn not only the probability values from the teacher's output but also\nthe relative ranking of classes, and proposes a novel Correlation Matching\nKnowledge Distillation (CMKD) method that combines the Pearson and Spearman\ncorrelation coefficients-based KD loss to achieve more efficient and robust\ndistillation from a stronger teacher model. Moreover, considering that samples\nvary in difficulty, CMKD dynamically adjusts the weights of the Pearson-based\nloss and Spearman-based loss. CMKD is simple yet practical, and extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that it can consistently achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on CIRAR-100 and ImageNet, and adapts well to various teacher\narchitectures, sizes, and other KD methods.",

An effective\nstrategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or\ngenerative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image\nRestoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically\nadjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact\nrepresentation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each\ngeneration step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent\nand instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded\nwith this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the\nvariance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which\nwe further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm\nadaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through\nmodulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can\nrestore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.",

      "abstract": "The soft-argmax operation is widely adopted in neural network-based stereo\nmatching methods to enable differentiable regression of disparity. However,\nnetwork trained with soft-argmax is prone to being multimodal due to absence of\nexplicit constraint to the shape of the probability distribution. Previous\nmethods leverages Laplacian distribution and cross-entropy for training but\nfailed to effectively improve the accuracy and even compromises the efficiency\nof the network. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the previous\ndistribution-based methods and propose a novel supervision method for stereo\nmatching, Sampling-Gaussian. We sample from the Gaussian distribution for\nsupervision. Moreover, we interpret the training as minimizing the distance in\nvector space and propose a combined loss of L1 loss and cosine similarity loss.\nAdditionally, we leveraged bilinear interpolation to upsample the cost volume.\nOur method can be directly applied to any soft-argmax-based stereo matching\nmethod without a reduction in efficiency. We have conducted comprehensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our Sampling-Gaussian.\nThe experimental results prove that we have achieved better accuracy on five\nbaseline methods and two datasets. Our method is easy to implement, and the\ncode is available online.",

However, training property\npredictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled\ndata and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a\nnovel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled\ndatasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a\nnon-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of\nrelying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form\nof estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a\nconditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this\nresults in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular\nstructures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly\nreduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used\nfor stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit\nguidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular\nproperties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular\noptimization tasks beyond stability optimization.",

      "abstract": "The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user\nrepresentations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited\ncomputational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous\nresearch efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked\na critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every\nad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these\nchallenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most\nuser model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals\na triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and\nservice SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated\nERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user\nrepresentations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache\ncategorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized\nsettings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model\ncomplexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the\nstaleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six\nmonths, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving\ncomputational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.",

However, it remains an\nopen challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand\nthe underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different\ntasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these\nlimitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and\nself-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational\nagents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent,\nand a robotic agent. Our framework iteratively grounds a base robot policy to\nrelevant objects in the environment and uses visuomotor cues to shift the\naction distribution of the policy to more desirable states, online, while\nremaining agnostic to the subjective configuration of a given robot hardware\nplatform. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation\npolicies to achieve significantly higher success rates, both in simulation and\nin real-world experiments, without the need for additional human demonstrations\nor extensive exploration.

      "abstract": "The advancement of robotic systems has revolutionized numerous industries,\nyet their operation often demands specialized technical knowledge, limiting\naccessibility for non-expert users. This paper introduces ROSA (Robot Operating\nSystem Agent), an AI-powered agent that bridges the gap between the Robot\nOperating System (ROS) and natural language interfaces. By leveraging\nstate-of-the-art language models and integrating open-source frameworks, ROSA\nenables operators to interact with robots using natural language, translating\ncommands into actions and interfacing with ROS through well-defined tools.\nROSA's design is modular and extensible, offering seamless integration with\nboth ROS1 and ROS2, along with safety mechanisms like parameter validation and\nconstraint enforcement to ensure secure, reliable operations. While ROSA is\noriginally designed for ROS, it can be extended to work with other robotics\nmiddle-wares to maximize compatibility across missions. ROSA enhances\nhuman-robot interaction by democratizing access to complex robotic systems,\nempowering users of all expertise levels with multi-modal capabilities such as\nspeech integration and visual perception. Ethical considerations are thoroughly\naddressed, guided by foundational principles like Asimov's Three Laws of\nRobotics, ensuring that AI integration promotes safety, transparency, privacy,\nand accountability. By making robotic technology more user-friendly and\naccessible, ROSA not only improves operational efficiency but also sets a new\nstandard for responsible AI use in robotics and potentially future mission\noperations. This paper introduces ROSA's architecture and showcases initial\nmock-up operations in JPL's Mars Yard, a laboratory, and a simulation using\nthree different robots.

While foundational large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI,\nGoogle, and Anthropic guard against both harmful behaviors and toxic strings,\nprevious work on math solutions that embed harmful prompts demonstrate that the\nguardrails may differ between expert contexts. These loopholes would appear in\nmixture of expert's models when the context of the question changes and may\noffer fewer malicious training examples to filter toxic comments or recommended\noffensive actions. The present work demonstrates that foundational models may\nrefuse to propose destructive actions correctly when prompted overtly but may\nunfortunately drop their guard when presented with a sudden change of context,\nlike solving a computer programming challenge. We show empirical examples with\ntrojan-hosting repositories like GitHub, NPM, NuGet, and popular content\ndelivery networks (CDN) like jsDelivr which amplify the attack surface. In the\nLLM's directives to be helpful, example recommendations propose application\nprogramming interface (API) endpoints which a determined domain-squatter could\nacquire and setup attack mobile infrastructure that triggers from the naively\ncopied code. We compare this attack to previous work on context-shifting and\ncontrast the attack surface as a novel version of \"living off the land\" attacks\nin the malware literature.

To address the performance gap between\nopen-source and proprietary models, we propose the Decompose, Critique and\nRefine (DeCRIM) self-correction pipeline, which enhances LLMs' ability to\nfollow constraints. DeCRIM works by decomposing the original instruction into a\nlist of constraints and using a Critic model to decide when and where the LLM's\nresponse needs refinement. Our results show that DeCRIM improves Mistral's\nperformance by 7.3% on RealInstruct and 8.0% on IFEval even with weak feedback.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that with strong feedback, open-source LLMs with\nDeCRIM can outperform GPT-4 on both benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision making, yet\ntraditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and\nadaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents ARDNS-FN-Quantum\n(Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator with Quantum enhancement), a novel\nframework that integrates a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action selection, a\ndual-memory system inspired by human cognition, and adaptive exploration\nstrategies modulated by reward variance and curiosity. Evaluated in a 10X10\ngrid-world over 20,000 episodes, ARDNS-FN-Quantum achieves a 99.5% success rate\n(versus 81.3% for DQN and 97.0% for PPO), a mean reward of 9.0528 across all\nepisodes (versus 1.2941 for DQN and 7.6196 for PPO), and an average of 46.7\nsteps to goal (versus 135.9 for DQN and 62.5 for PPO). In the last 100\nepisodes, it records a mean reward of 9.1652 (versus 7.0916 for DQN and 9.0310\nfor PPO) and 37.2 steps to goal (versus 52.7 for DQN and 53.4 for PPO).\nGraphical analyses, including learning curves, steps-to-goal trends, reward\nvariance, and reward distributions, demonstrate ARDNS-FN-Quantum's superior\nstability (reward variance 5.424 across all episodes versus 252.262 for DQN and\n76.583 for PPO) and efficiency. By bridging quantum computing, cognitive\nscience, and RL, ARDNS-FN-Quantum offers a scalable, human-like approach to\nadaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in\nrobotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's\nrobust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable\nsyntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code.\nHowever, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe\nconstructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety\nguarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs\ngenerated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a\npeephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual\nfunctions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs\ndecision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process.\nAdditionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors\nintroduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during\ncompilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and\nevaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show\nthat PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these\nprojects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On\naverage, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an\naverage cost of $1.46.",

Traditional detection methods often\nrely on static anomaly detection techniques that fail to adapt to dynamic\nconversational shifts. One key limitation is the misinterpretation of benign\ntopic transitions referred to as concept drift as fraudulent behavior, leading\nto either false alarms or missed threats. We propose a two stage detection\nframework that first identifies suspicious conversations using a tailored\nensemble classification model.

    "abstract": "Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL)\nmodels of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented\nhas been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that\npolicy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a\npotential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is\nunsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, \"Value-free\" --\nwhile they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting\n(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching\nto PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of\nbehavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems\nfrom the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by\nthe standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve\nit. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as\npart of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the\ndifferent methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,\ninstead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the\nunderlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from\nan experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be\nreconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,\nfull-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are\nrelaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as\na case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than\nstatistical, view of what constitutes \"a model\" in cognitive sciences. Our\nanalysis suggests that besides \"parametric\" statistical complexity, additional\naspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when\nevaluating model complexity.",

    "abstract": "We show that there is a fast algorithm that embeds hierarchical structures in\nthree-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The correlation of data ends up purely\nencoded in the causal structure. Our model relies solely on oriented token\npairs -- local hierarchical signals -- with no access to global symbolic\nstructure. We apply our method to the corpus of \\textit{WordNet}. We provide a\nperfect embedding of the mammal sub-tree including ambiguities (more than one\nhierarchy per node) in such a way that the hierarchical structures get\ncompletely codified in the geometry and exactly reproduce the ground-truth. We\nextend this to a perfect embedding of the maximal unambiguous subset of the\n\\textit{WordNet} with 82{,}115 noun tokens and a single hierarchy per token. We\nintroduce a novel retrieval mechanism in which causality, not distance, governs\nhierarchical access. Our results seem to indicate that all discrete data has a\nperfect geometrical representation that is three-dimensional. The resulting\nembeddings are nearly conformally invariant, indicating deep connections with\ngeneral relativity and field theory. These results suggest that concepts,\ncategories, and their interrelations, namely hierarchical meaning itself, is\ngeometric.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to\ninnovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs).\nDespite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how\nelementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information\nwithout the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To\nprovide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation\noccurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN.\nRCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a\nwell-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given\nattractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to\nconstruct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on\nthe role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when\nmodelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results,\nwe conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state\nspaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in\nsystems beyond RCs.",

Our work presents a novel\nuncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative\nReplay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture\nefficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced\nproportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a\nVLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods\nthat depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates\nwithout any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data\nand adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled\nwith dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along\nwith DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data\nrepresentative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that\nreplays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental\nanalyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and\nTinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention,\nachieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%,\n59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.",

This dissertation offers a new\nperspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of\nregularity. Building upon this notion, we introduce three major contributions.\nFirst, we introduce methods that endow robots with object-centric priors,\nallowing them to learn generalizable, closed-loop sensorimotor policies from a\nsmall number of teleoperation demonstrations. Second, we introduce methods that\nconstitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate\nmanipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations. Last but not least, we\nintroduce methods that enable robots to identify reusable skills from their\npast experiences, resulting in systems that can continually imitate multiple\ntasks in a sequential manner. Altogether, the contributions of this\ndissertation help lay the groundwork for building general-purpose personal\nrobots that can quickly adapt to new situations or tasks with low-cost data\ncollection and interact easily with humans. By enabling robots to learn and\ngeneralize from limited data, this dissertation takes a step toward realizing\nthe vision of intelligent robotic assistants that can be seamlessly integrated\ninto everyday scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across\ntext, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal\nreasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce\nEchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in\nMLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice\nquestion answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we\ncurate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with\nmultiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves\n85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which\nscores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy,\nEchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial\ninterpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs.\nThese results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning\nenhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to\nunify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning\nvia reinforcement learning.

Statistical methods for nonparametric\nchange-point detection -- especially the tools of conformal test martingales\n(CTMs) and anytime-valid inference -- offer promising approaches to this\nmonitoring task. However, existing methods are restricted to monitoring limited\nhypothesis classes or ``alarm criteria'' (such as data shifts that violate\ncertain exchangeability assumptions), do not allow for online adaptation in\nresponse to shifts, and/or do not enable root-cause analysis of any\ndegradation. In this paper, we expand the scope of these monitoring methods by\nproposing a weighted generalization of conformal test martingales (WCTMs),\nwhich lay a theoretical foundation for online monitoring for any unexpected\nchangepoints in the data distribution while controlling false-alarms. For\npractical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms that adapt online\nto mild covariate shifts (in the marginal input distribution) while quickly\ndetecting and diagnosing more severe shifts, such as concept shifts (in the\nconditional label distribution) or extreme (out-of-support) covariate shifts\nthat cannot be easily adapted to.

Risks come from failure to control powerful AI\nsystems, misuse of AI by malicious rogue actors, war between great powers, and\nauthoritarian lock-in. This research agenda has two aims: to describe the\nstrategic landscape of AI development and to catalog important governance\nresearch questions. These questions, if answered, would provide important\ninsight on how to successfully reduce catastrophic risks.\n  We describe four high-level scenarios for the geopolitical response to\nadvanced AI development, cataloging the research questions most relevant to\neach. Our favored scenario involves building the technical, legal, and\ninstitutional infrastructure required to internationally restrict dangerous AI\ndevelopment and deployment (which we refer to as an Off Switch), which leads\ninto an internationally coordinated Halt on frontier AI activities at some\npoint in the future. The second scenario we describe is a US National Project\nfor AI, in which the US Government races to develop advanced AI systems and\nestablish unilateral control over global AI development. We also describe two\nadditional scenarios: a Light-Touch world similar to that of today and a Threat\nof Sabotage situation where countries use sabotage and deterrence to slow AI\ndevelopment.\n  In our view, apart from the Off Switch and Halt scenario, all of these\ntrajectories appear to carry an unacceptable risk of catastrophic harm.

To this end, a\nDarkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image\ndisentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded\nmulti-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training\n(enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss\ncaused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a\nlatent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the\ncascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised\nto acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper\ncross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve\ntexture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is\ndesigned to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image\nfusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more\ninformative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark\nenvironments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB\nPSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision\ntasks.

Although many studies use large language and vision-language models\nto assist the blind, most focus on static content and fail to meet real-time\nperception needs in dynamic and complex environments, such as daily activities.\nTo provide them with more effective intelligent assistance, it is imperative to\nincorporate advanced visual understanding technologies. Although real-time\nvision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual\nunderstanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness\nin assisting visually impaired individuals. In this work, we conduct the first\nsuch evaluation. First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily),\ncovering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals:\nBasic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks. The results show that\nGPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. Next, we conduct a user study to\nevaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further\nexploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts.\nOne key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving\npotential hazards in dynamic environments. To address this, we build an\nenvironment-awareness dataset named SafeVid and introduce a polling mechanism\nthat enables the model to proactively detect environmental risks.

    "abstract": "Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks\namong probabilistic generative models. Building upon the ideas of continuous\nnormalizing flows, flow matching models generalize the transport path of the\ndiffusion models from a simple prior distribution to the data. Most flow\nmatching models in the literature do not explicitly model the underlying\nstructure/manifold in the target data when learning the flow from a simple\nsource distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient\nlearning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often\nreside in a low-dimensional manifold. Existing strategies of incorporating\nmanifolds, including data with underlying multi-modal distribution, often\nrequire expensive training and hence frequently lead to suboptimal performance.\nTo this end, we present \\texttt{Latent-CFM}, which provides simplified\ntraining/inference strategies to incorporate multi-modal data structures using\npretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on multi-modal\nsynthetic data and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that\n\\texttt{Latent-CFM} exhibits improved generation quality with significantly\nless training ($\\sim 50\\%$ less in some cases) and computation than\nstate-of-the-art flow matching models. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we\ndemonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than\ncompetitive approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we\ndemonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation\nconditioned on latent features.",

Current FL strategies transmit a tremendous amount of\ndata (model weights) within the FL process, which needs a high communication\nbandwidth. Considering resource constraints, increasing the number of clients\nand, consequently, the amount of data (model weights) can lead to a bottleneck.\nIn this paper, we introduce the Federated Black Widow Optimization (FedBWO)\ntechnique to decrease the amount of transmitted data by transmitting only a\nperformance score rather than the local model weights from clients.

By formalizing adaptation as $f:(\\mathbf{x} \\,|\n\\,C_t) \\to \\mathbf{y}$, with $C_t$ representing a dynamic context memory, FLAIR\ndelivers predictions aligned with the current concept, eliminating the need for\nruntime parameter optimization. To achieve this, FLAIR integrates two key\nmodules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding task-specific features into\nstandardized representations, and a Dynamic Decision Engine, pre-trained via\nBayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly using contextual information at\nruntime. Extensive experiments across key database tasks demonstrate that FLAIR\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 5.2x faster adaptation\nand reducing error by 22.5% for cardinality estimation.",

    "abstract": "We propose a deep product-unit residual neural network (PURe) that integrates\nproduct units into residual blocks to improve the expressiveness and parameter\nefficiency of deep convolutional networks. Unlike standard summation neurons,\nproduct units enable multiplicative feature interactions, potentially offering\na more powerful representation of complex patterns. PURe replaces conventional\nconvolutional layers with 2D product units in the second layer of each residual\nblock, eliminating nonlinear activation functions to preserve structural\ninformation. We validate PURe on three benchmark datasets. On Galaxy10 DECaLS,\nPURe34 achieves the highest test accuracy of 84.89%, surpassing the much deeper\nResNet152, while converging nearly five times faster and demonstrating strong\nrobustness to Poisson noise. On ImageNet, PURe architectures outperform\nstandard ResNet models at similar depths, with PURe34 achieving a top-1\naccuracy of 80.27% and top-5 accuracy of 95.78%, surpassing deeper ResNet\nvariants (ResNet50, ResNet101) while utilizing significantly fewer parameters\nand computational resources. On CIFAR-10, PURe consistently outperforms ResNet\nvariants across varying depths, with PURe272 reaching 95.01% test accuracy,\ncomparable to ResNet1001 but at less than half the model size. These results\ndemonstrate that PURe achieves a favorable balance between accuracy,\nefficiency, and robustness. Compared to traditional residual networks, PURe not\nonly achieves competitive classification performance with faster convergence\nand fewer parameters, but also demonstrates greater robustness to noise. Its\neffectiveness across diverse datasets highlights the potential of\nproduct-unit-based architectures for scalable and reliable deep learning in\ncomputer vision.",

Still, the impact of model size on the\nperformance of vision transformers in similar scenarios, particularly under\nlabel noise, remains largely unexplored. Given the utility and versatility of\ntransformer architectures, this study investigates their practicality under\nlow-budget constraints and noisy labels. We explore how classification accuracy\nand calibration are affected by symmetric label noise in active learning\nsettings, evaluating four vision transformer configurations (Base and Large\nwith 16x16 and 32x32 patch sizes) and three Swin Transformer configurations\n(Tiny, Small, and Base) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, under varying label\nnoise rates. Our findings show that larger ViT models (ViTl32 in particular)\nconsistently outperform their smaller counterparts in both accuracy and\ncalibration, even under moderate to high label noise, while Swin Transformers\nexhibit weaker robustness across all noise levels. We find that smaller patch\nsizes do not always lead to better performance, as ViTl16 performs consistently\nworse than ViTl32 while incurring a higher computational cost. We also find\nthat information-based Active Learning strategies only provide meaningful\naccuracy improvements at moderate label noise rates, but they result in poorer\ncalibration compared to models trained on randomly acquired labels, especially\nat high label noise rates. We hope these insights provide actionable guidance\nfor practitioners looking to deploy vision transformers in resource-constrained\nenvironments, where balancing model complexity, label noise, and compute\nefficiency is critical in model fine-tuning or distillation.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HeteGNNs) have demonstrated strong\nabilities to learn node representations by effectively extracting complex\nstructural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Most of the\nprevailing HeteGNNs follow the neighborhood aggregation paradigm, leveraging\nmeta-path based message passing to learn latent node representations. However,\ndue to the pairwise nature of meta-paths, these models fail to capture\nhigh-order relations among nodes, resulting in suboptimal performance.\nAdditionally, the challenge of ``over-squashing'', where long-range message\npassing in HeteGNNs leads to severe information distortion, further limits the\nefficacy of these models. To address these limitations, this paper proposes\nMGA-HHN, a Multi-Granular Attention based Heterogeneous Hypergraph Neural\nNetwork for heterogeneous graph representation learning. MGA-HHN introduces two\nkey innovations: (1) a novel approach for constructing meta-path based\nheterogeneous hypergraphs that explicitly models higher-order semantic\ninformation in heterogeneous graphs through multiple views, and (2) a\nmulti-granular attention mechanism that operates at both the node and hyperedge\nlevels. This mechanism enables the model to capture fine-grained interactions\namong nodes sharing the same semantic context within a hyperedge type, while\npreserving the diversity of semantics across different hyperedge types. As\nsuch, MGA-HHN effectively mitigates long-range message distortion and generates\nmore expressive node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that MGA-HHN outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, showcasing its effectiveness in node classification, node clustering\nand visualization tasks.",

    "abstract": "DBSCAN, a well-known density-based clustering algorithm, has gained\nwidespread popularity and usage due to its effectiveness in identifying\nclusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noisy data. However, it encounters\nchallenges in producing satisfactory cluster results when confronted with\ndatasets of varying density scales, a common scenario in real-world\napplications. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive and Robust DBSCAN with\nMulti-agent Reinforcement Learning cluster framework, namely AR-DBSCAN. First,\nwe model the initial dataset as a two-level encoding tree and categorize the\ndata vertices into distinct density partitions according to the information\nuncertainty determined in the encoding tree. Each partition is then assigned to\nan agent to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. The\nallocation is density-adaptive, enabling AR-DBSCAN to effectively handle\ndiverse density distributions within the dataset by utilizing distinct agents\nfor different partitions. Second, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning\nguided automatic parameter searching process is designed. The process of\nadjusting the parameter search direction by perceiving the clustering\nenvironment is modeled as a Markov decision process. Using a weakly-supervised\nreward training policy network, each agent adaptively learns the optimal\nclustering parameters by interacting with the clusters. Third, a recursive\nsearch mechanism adaptable to the data's scale is presented, enabling efficient\nand controlled exploration of large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on nine artificial datasets and a real-world dataset. The results of\noffline and online tasks show that AR-DBSCAN not only improves clustering\naccuracy by up to 144.1% and 175.3% in the NMI and ARI metrics, respectively,\nbut also is capable of robustly finding dominant parameters.",

The task is turn-based,\nmulti-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its\nlong-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated\ndynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play\n(HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates\ncentralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level\nmotion control.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform\nfor symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent\nchallenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic,\ncomplex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that\nmotivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be\neffectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI\nsystems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on\nfoundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while\nintroducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for\ndynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive\ninheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and\nCloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves\nbeyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation\nparadigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle,\nensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of\nLoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation\nlanguage, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse\ninference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility,\nexpressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of\nmultiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics\nin water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK.\nFurthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge\nrepresentation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and\nknowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational\nconsiderations of the KERAIA platform.",

To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient\nalgorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem,\nwhich can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal\ncontrol and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our\nproposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it\neffectively.

Second, it\nincludes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by\ndynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable\nneighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies\nwith a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently\ndelivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five\nleading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for\n350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177\ninstances.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndistributed clients while preserving data locality. Although FedAvg pioneered\nsynchronous rounds for global model averaging, slower devices can delay\ncollective progress. Asynchronous FL (e.g., FedAsync) addresses stragglers by\ncontinuously integrating client updates, yet naive implementations risk client\ndrift due to non-IID data and stale contributions. Some Blockchain-based FL\napproaches (e.g., BRAIN) employ robust weighting or scoring of updates to\nresist malicious or misaligned proposals. However, performance drops can still\npersist under severe data heterogeneity or high staleness, and synchronization\noverhead has emerged as a new concern due to its aggregator-free architectures.\n  We introduce Fast-and-Reliable AI Network, FRAIN, a new asynchronous FL\nmethod that mitigates these limitations by incorporating two key ideas. First,\nour FastSync strategy eliminates the need to replay past model versions,\nenabling newcomers and infrequent participants to efficiently approximate the\nglobal model. Second, we adopt spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) when\nmerging parameters, preserving models' directions and alleviating destructive\ninterference from divergent local training.\n  Experiments with a CNN image-classification model and a Transformer-based\nlanguage model demonstrate that FRAIN achieves more stable and robust\nconvergence than FedAvg, FedAsync, and BRAIN, especially under harsh\nenvironments: non-IID data distributions, networks that experience delays and\nrequire frequent re-synchronization, and the presence of malicious nodes.",

Existing detection methods are usually only based on 2D RGB images and\ncannot accurately analyze the physical characteristics of potholes. In this\npaper, a publicly available dataset of RGB-D images (PothRGBD) is created and\nan improved YOLOv8-based model is proposed for both pothole detection and\npothole physical features analysis. The Intel RealSense D415 depth camera was\nused to collect RGB and depth data from the road surfaces, resulting in a\nPothRGBD dataset of 1000 images. The data was labeled in YOLO format suitable\nfor segmentation. A novel YOLO model is proposed based on the YOLOv8n-seg\narchitecture, which is structurally improved with Dynamic Snake Convolution\n(DSConv), Simple Attention Module (SimAM) and Gaussian Error Linear Unit\n(GELU). The proposed model segmented potholes with irregular edge structure\nmore accurately, and performed perimeter and depth measurements on depth maps\nwith high accuracy. The standard YOLOv8n-seg model achieved 91.9% precision,\n85.2% recall and 91.9% mAP@50. With the proposed model, the values increased to\n93.7%, 90.4% and 93.8% respectively. Thus, an improvement of 1.96% in\nprecision, 6.13% in recall and 2.07% in mAP was achieved. The proposed model\nperforms pothole detection as well as perimeter and depth measurement with high\naccuracy and is suitable for real-time applications due to its low model\ncomplexity. In this way, a lightweight and effective model that can be used in\ndeep learning-based intelligent transportation solutions has been acquired.",

A vexing\nproblem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal\ndocuments such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical,\nto easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal\neducation. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal\nknowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and\ncomprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into\nsnippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses\non explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we\nconstruct a Legal Question Bank (LQB), which is a collection of legal questions\nwhose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive\nCLIC Recommender (CRec). Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation\nthat requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists\nquestions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given\nlegal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant\nlegal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects\nof creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such\nas GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated\nquestions (MGQs) against human-composed questions (HCQs) and find that MGQs are\nmore scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more\nprecise.

To this end, this paper studies the personalized\nrisks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital\nadvertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model\n(LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer\narchitecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural\nlanguage text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an\nalgorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor\nrisk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing,\nfeature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT\nfor advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user\nportraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure\nthe security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper\ndesigns an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a\nlarge language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The\nexperimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively\nimprove the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the\nsame time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the\nrisk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in Artificial\nIntelligence. As with most of these challenges, there is a harsh dilemma\nbetween the expressive power of the language used, and the tractability of the\ncomputational problem posed by reasoning. Inspired by human reasoning, we\nintroduce a method of first-order relational probabilistic inference that\nsatisfies both criteria, and can handle hybrid (discrete and continuous)\nvariables. Specifically, we extend sum-of-squares logic of expectation to\nrelational settings, demonstrating that lifted reasoning in the bounded-degree\nfragment for knowledge bases of bounded quantifier rank can be performed in\npolynomial time, even with an a priori unknown and/or countably infinite set of\nobjects. Crucially, our notion of tractability is framed in proof-theoretic\nterms, which extends beyond the syntactic properties of the language or\nqueries. We are able to derive the tightest bounds provable by proofs of a\ngiven degree and size and establish completeness in our sum-of-squares\nrefutations for fixed degrees.",

Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a\nWide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing\nthe role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both\nmonolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet).

Many real-world\ngraphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and using\nGNNs on them requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. However,\nthis can lead to reduced accuracy in some cases, and sampling and data transfer\nfrom the CPU to the GPU can also slow down training. On the other hand,\ndistributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overhead and\nload imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose Plexus, a\nthree-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles\nthese issues and scales to billion-edge graphs.

We quantify these\ncontributions using a metric called compute-equivalent gain (CEG), which\nestimates the additional compute that would be required to achieve similar\nimprovements without these algorithmic advancements.\n  To validate this framework, we conduct small-scale training experiments with\na scaled-down GPT-2 model. Our results confirm that compute-independent\nadvancements yield meaningful performance gains even in resource-constrained\nsettings, with a CEG of up to $3.5\\times$ over a baseline model. By contrast,\ncompute-dependent advancements provided little benefit or even degraded\nperformance at the small scale, reinforcing the importance of compute\navailability for certain algorithmic gains.",

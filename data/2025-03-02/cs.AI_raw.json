    "abstract": "While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong\ngeneralization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale\ncontrol data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in\ntheir ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned\ntraining data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide\nvaluable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key\nchallenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how\nbest to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore\nthis question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods\ncalled sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights.\nFirst, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory\npreference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of\nsub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian\nreward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory\nimprovement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual\ncues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted\nbehavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior\ncloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while\nincorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories\npreceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is\npreliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control\ndomain. Please enjoy our airport puns.",

In this study, we investigate how this aspect of intergroup relations in\nhumans is replicated by LLMs in an emotion intensity prediction task. In this\ntask, the LLM is given a short description of an experience a person had that\ncaused them to feel a particular emotion; the LLM is then prompted to predict\nthe intensity of the emotion the person experienced on a numerical scale. By\nmanipulating the group identities assigned to the LLM's persona (the\n\"perceiver\") and the person in the narrative (the \"experiencer\"), we measure\nhow predicted emotion intensities differ between in-group and out-group\nsettings. We observe that LLMs assign higher emotion intensity scores to\nin-group members than out-group members.

However, the lack of large publicly available labeled datasets\nlimits the development of deep learning-based CAD systems. Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), in particular, CycleGAN, can be used to generate\nnew cross-domain images without paired training data. However, most\nCycleGAN-based synthesis methods lack the potential to overcome alignment and\nasymmetry between the input and generated data. We propose a two-stage\ntechnique for the synthesis of abdominal MRI using cross-modality translation\nof abdominal CT. We show that the synthetic data can help improve the\nperformance of the liver segmentation network. We increase the number of\nabdominal MRI images through cross-modality image transformation of unpaired CT\nimages using a CycleGAN inspired deformation invariant network called EssNet.\nSubsequently, we combine the synthetic MRI images with the original MRI images\nand use them to improve the accuracy of the U-Net on a liver segmentation task.\nWe train the U-Net on real MRI images and then on real and synthetic MRI\nimages. Consequently, by comparing both scenarios, we achieve an improvement in\nthe performance of U-Net. In summary, the improvement achieved in the\nIntersection over Union (IoU) is 1.17%.

Policy constraint methods\nformulate policy learning as an optimization problem that balances maximizing\nreward with minimizing deviation from the behavior policy. Closed form\nsolutions to this problem can be derived as weighted behavioral cloning\nobjectives that, in theory, must compute an intractable partition function.\nReinforcement learning has gained popularity in language modeling to align\nmodels with human preferences; some recent works consider paired completions\nthat are ranked by a preference model following which the likelihood of the\npreferred completion is directly increased. We adapt this approach of paired\ncomparison. By reformulating the paired-sample optimization problem, we fit the\nmaximum-mode of the Q function while maximizing behavioral consistency of\npolicy actions. This yields our algorithm, Behavior Preference Regression for\noffline RL (BPR). We empirically evaluate BPR on the widely used D4RL\nLocomotion and Antmaze datasets, as well as the more challenging V-D4RL suite,\nwhich operates in image-based state spaces.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series data play a pivotal role in a wide range of\nreal-world applications. However, the presence of block missing data introduces\nsignificant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive\nmodels. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and\nthen perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in\ncomplex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and\nintricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end\ntime series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data\nhandling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture.\nUnlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing\nstep, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and\nrepresent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the\nunderlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two\nkey components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the\nMissing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to\nderive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns,\nwhile the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as\ndual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical\nevaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results underscore\nthe efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, showcasing\nits robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. Our\nfindings highlight the potential of S4M to advance reliable time series\nforecasting in practical applications, offering a promising direction for\nfuture research and deployment.

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness is a critical challenge in deploying deep neural\nnetworks for real-world applications. While adversarial training is a widely\nrecognized defense strategy, most existing studies focus on balanced datasets,\noverlooking the prevalence of long-tailed distributions in real-world data,\nwhich significantly complicates robustness. This paper provides a comprehensive\nanalysis of adversarial training under long-tailed distributions and identifies\nlimitations in the current state-of-the-art method, AT-BSL, in achieving robust\nperformance under such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel training framework, TAET, which integrates an initial stabilization phase\nfollowed by a stratified equalization adversarial training phase. Additionally,\nprior work on long-tailed robustness has largely ignored the crucial evaluation\nmetric of balanced accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of\nbalanced robustness, a comprehensive metric tailored for assessing robustness\nunder long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod surpasses existing advanced defenses, achieving significant improvements\nin both memory and computational efficiency. This work represents a substantial\nadvancement in addressing robustness challenges in real-world applications.

Manipulation susceptibility was tested by inserting\nmisleading narratives and irrelevant details. Contextual awareness was\nrvaluated by comparing diagnoses with and without patient history. We analyzed\ndiagnostic change rates and response patterns across manipulations.\n  LLMs showed perfect diagnostic consistency for identical data but significant\nmanipulation susceptibility. Gemini had a 40% diagnosis change rate and ChatGPT\n30% with irrelevant details. ChatGPT had a higher context influence rate (77.8%\nvs. Gemini's 55.6%), but both showed limited nuanced contextual integration,\nexhibiting anchoring bias by prioritizing salient data over context.\n  LLMs' vulnerability to manipulation and limited contextual awareness pose\nchallenges in clinical use.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) encounters challenges when addressing\ncomplex queries, particularly multi-hop questions. While several methods tackle\nmulti-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving\nexternal documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this\npaper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during\nlayer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent\nextraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in\nintermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other\nlayers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG).

This will allow for downstream tasks such as\nsegmentation, navigation, and localization. To our knowledge, there is no\ndataset available in this domain. As such, we propose a novel maritime 3D scene\nreconstruction benchmarking dataset, named as MTReD (Maritime Three-Dimensional\nReconstruction Dataset). The MTReD comprises 19 fly-over videos curated from\nthe Internet containing ships, islands, and coastlines. As the task is aimed\ntowards geometrical consistency and visual completeness, the dataset uses two\nmetrics: (1) Reprojection error; and (2) Perception based metrics. We find that\nexisting perception-based metrics, such as Learned Perceptual Image Patch\nSimilarity (LPIPS), do not appropriately measure the completeness of a\nreconstructed image. Thus, we propose a novel semantic similarity metric\nutilizing DINOv2 features coined DiFPS (DinoV2 Features Perception Similarity).\nWe perform initial evaluation on two baselines: (1) Structured from Motion\n(SfM) through Colmap; and (2) the recent state-of-the-art MASt3R model. We find\nthat the reconstructed scenes by MASt3R have higher reprojection errors, but\nsuperior perception based metric scores. To this end, some pre-processing\nmethods are explored, and we find a pre-processing method which improves both\nthe reprojection error and perception-based score. We envisage our proposed\nMTReD to stimulate further research in these directions. The dataset and all\nthe code will be made available in https://github.com/RuiYiYong/MTReD.",

    "abstract": "Independent microgrids are crucial for supplying electricity by combining\ndistributed energy resources and loads in scenarios like isolated islands and\nfield combat. Fast and accurate assessments of microgrid vulnerability against\nintentional attacks or natural disasters are essential for effective risk\nprevention and design optimization. However, conventional Monte Carlo\nsimulation (MCS) methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming,\nwhile existing machine learning-based approaches often lack accuracy and\nexplainability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a fast and\nexplainable vulnerability assessment framework that integrates MCS with a graph\nattention network enhanced by self-attention pooling (GAT-S). MCS generates\ntraining data, while the GAT-S model learns the structural and electrical\ncharacteristics of the microgrid and further assesses its vulnerability\nintelligently. The GAT-S improves explainability and computational efficiency\nby dynamically assigning attention weights to critical nodes. Comprehensive\nexperimental evaluations across various microgrid configurations demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework provides accurate vulnerability assessments,\nachieving a mean squared error as low as 0.001, real-time responsiveness within\n1 second, and delivering explainable results.",

    "abstract": "How to endow aerial robots with the ability to operate in close proximity\nremains an open problem. The core challenges lie in the propulsion system's\ndual-task requirement: generating manipulation forces while simultaneously\ncounteracting gravity. These competing demands create dynamic coupling effects\nduring physical interactions. Furthermore, rotor-induced airflow disturbances\ncritically undermine operational reliability. Although fully-actuated unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) alleviate dynamic coupling effects via\nsix-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) force-torque decoupling, existing implementations\nfail to address the aerodynamic interference between drones and environments.\nThey also suffer from oversized designs, which compromise maneuverability and\nlimit their applications in various operational scenarios.

By\nintegrating control surfaces into fully-actuated systems for the first time, we\nsignificantly suppress lateral airflow disturbances during operations.\nFurthermore, a coaxial dual-rotor configuration enables a compact size while\nmaintaining high hovering efficiency.

To address these limitations in dynamic\nenvironments, we propose Closed-Loop Embodied Agent (CLEA) -- a novel\narchitecture incorporating four specialized open-source LLMs with functional\ndecoupling for closed-loop task management. The framework features two core\ninnovations: (1) Interactive task planner that dynamically generates executable\nsubtasks based on the environmental memory, and (2) Multimodal execution critic\nemploying an evaluation framework to conduct a probabilistic assessment of\naction feasibility, triggering hierarchical re-planning mechanisms when\nenvironmental perturbations exceed preset thresholds. To validate CLEA's\neffectiveness, we conduct experiments in a real environment with manipulable\nobjects, using two heterogeneous robots for object search, manipulation, and\nsearch-manipulation integration tasks. Across 12 task trials, CLEA outperforms\nthe baseline model, achieving a 67.3% improvement in success rate and a 52.8%\nincrease in task completion rate. These results demonstrate that CLEA\nsignificantly enhances the robustness of task planning and execution in dynamic\nenvironments.",

To help\npathologists observe IHC images with high quality in surgery, this paper\nproposes a Cross-REsolution compensATed and multi-frequency Enhanced FS-to-FFPE\n(CREATE-FFPE) stain transfer framework, which is the first FS-to-FFPE method\nfor the intraoperative IHC images.

Unlike conventional\nbenchmarks, OrdRankBen incorporates structured ordinal labels, enabling more\nprecise ranking evaluations. Given the absence of suitable datasets for ordinal\nrelevance ranking in NLP, we constructed two datasets with distinct ordinal\nlabel distributions. We further evaluate various models for three model types,\nranking-based language models, general large language models, and\nranking-focused large language models on these datasets. Experimental results\nshow that ordinal relevance modeling provides a more precise evaluation of\nranking models, improving their ability to distinguish multi-granularity\ndifferences among ranked items-crucial for tasks that demand fine-grained\nrelevance differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Choosing an appropriate optimization algorithm is essential to achieving\nsuccess in optimization challenges. Here we present a new evolutionary\nalgorithm structure that utilizes a reinforcement learning-based agent aimed at\naddressing these issues. The agent employs a double deep q-network to choose a\nspecific evolutionary operator based on feedback it receives from the\nenvironment during optimization. The algorithm's structure contains five\nsingle-objective evolutionary algorithm operators. This single-objective\nstructure is transformed into a multi-objective one using the R2 indicator.\nThis indicator serves two purposes within our structure: first, it renders the\nalgorithm multi-objective, and second, provides a means to evaluate each\nalgorithm's performance in each generation to facilitate constructing the\nreinforcement learning-based reward function. The proposed R2-reinforcement\nlearning multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (R2-RLMOEA) is compared with\nsix other multi-objective algorithms that are based on R2 indicators. These six\nalgorithms include the operators used in R2-RLMOEA as well as an R2\nindicator-based algorithm that randomly selects operators during optimization.\nWe benchmark performance using the CEC09 functions, with performance measured\nby inverted generational distance and spacing. The R2-RLMOEA algorithm\noutperforms all other algorithms with strong statistical significance (p<0.001)\nwhen compared with the average spacing metric across all ten benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "LLMs have becoming increasingly powerful, both in their benign and malicious\nuses. With the increase in capabilities, researchers have been increasingly\ninterested in their ability to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In\nparticular, recent work has conducted preliminary studies on the ability of LLM\nagents to autonomously hack websites. However, these studies are limited to\nsimple vulnerabilities.\n  In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously exploit one-day\nvulnerabilities in real-world systems. To show this, we collected a dataset of\n15 one-day vulnerabilities that include ones categorized as critical severity\nin the CVE description. When given the CVE description, GPT-4 is capable of\nexploiting 87% of these vulnerabilities compared to 0% for every other model we\ntest (GPT-3.5, open-source LLMs) and open-source vulnerability scanners (ZAP\nand Metasploit). Fortunately, our GPT-4 agent requires the CVE description for\nhigh performance: without the description, GPT-4 can exploit only 7% of the\nvulnerabilities. Our findings raise questions around the widespread deployment\nof highly capable LLM agents.",

Some efforts such as Groq address this issue by\nlightning fast processing of the LLM, but we know from the cognitive psychology\nliterature that in human-to-human dialogue often responses occur prior to the\nspeaker completing their utterance. No amount of delay for LLM processing is\nacceptable if we wish to maintain human dialogue latencies. In this paper, we\ndiscuss methods for understanding an utterance in close to real time and\ngenerating a response so that the system can comply with human-level\nconversational turn delays. This means that the information content of the\nfinal part of the speaker's utterance is lost to the LLM. Using the Google\nNaturalQuestions (NQ) database, our results show GPT-4 can effectively fill in\nmissing context from a dropped word at the end of a question over 60% of the\ntime. We also provide some examples of utterances and the impacts of this\ninformation loss on the quality of LLM response in the context of an avatar\nthat is currently under development.

WildGraph successfully generates\nrealistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60.\nExperiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in\ncomparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance\nin several benchmark metrics.

By fostering new levels of\nautomation, efficiency, and predictive maintenance, IIoT is transforming\ntraditional industries into intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems.\nHowever, achieving highly reliable IIoT can be hindered by factors such as the\ncost of installing large numbers of sensors, limitations in retrofitting\nexisting systems with sensors, or harsh environmental conditions that may make\nsensor installation impractical. Soft (virtual) sensing leverages mathematical\nmodels to estimate variables from physical sensor data, offering a solution to\nthese challenges. Data-driven and physics-based modeling are the two main\nmethodologies widely used for soft sensing. The choice between these strategies\ndepends on the complexity of the underlying system, with the data-driven\napproach often being preferred when the physics-based inference models are\nintricate and present challenges for state estimation. However, conventional\ndeep learning models are typically hindered by their inability to explicitly\nrepresent the complex interactions among various sensors. To address this\nlimitation, we adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), renowned for their ability\nto effectively capture the complex relationships between sensor measurements.\nIn this research, we propose physics-enhanced GNNs, which integrate principles\nof physics into graph-based methodologies. This is achieved by augmenting\nadditional nodes in the input graph derived from the underlying characteristics\nof the physical processes. Our evaluation of the proposed methodology on the\ncase study of district heating networks reveals significant improvements over\npurely data-driven GNNs, even in the presence of noise and parameter\ninaccuracies.",

Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified\nelasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network\ntakes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density\ndistribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to\ndesign spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an\nn-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse\nhomogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization\nof each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input\ncoordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined.

    "abstract": "Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of\ninterest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios. Due to the\nscarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained\ntransformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are\nstill limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high\ncomputation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D\nmodels, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce\nAny2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models\n(vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from\nany source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection\nstrategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions\nwithin the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token\nwith a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D\ngeometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the\ntransformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each\ntransformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial\nknowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D\ntokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We\nconduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour method. Code and models are released at\nhttps://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.",

    "abstract": "Recent text-to-image generative models such as Stable Diffusion are extremely\nadept at mimicking and generating copyrighted content, raising concerns amongst\nartists that their unique styles may be improperly copied. Understanding how\ngenerative models copy \"artistic style\" is more complex than duplicating a\nsingle image, as style is comprised by a set of elements (or signature) that\nfrequently co-occurs across a body of work, where each individual work may vary\nsignificantly. In our paper, we first reformulate the problem of \"artistic\ncopyright infringement\" to a classification problem over image sets, instead of\nprobing image-wise similarities. We then introduce ArtSavant, a practical\n(i.e., efficient and easy to understand) tool to (i) determine the unique style\nof an artist by comparing it to a reference dataset of works from 372 artists\ncurated from WikiArt, and (ii) recognize if the identified style reappears in\ngenerated images. We leverage two complementary methods to perform artistic\nstyle classification over image sets, includingTagMatch, which is a novel\ninherently interpretable and attributable method, making it more suitable for\nbroader use by non-technical stake holders (artists, lawyers, judges, etc).\nLeveraging ArtSavant, we then perform a large-scale empirical study to provide\nquantitative insight on the prevalence of artistic style copying across 3\npopular text-to-image generative models. Namely, amongst a dataset of prolific\nartists (including many famous ones), only 20% of them appear to have their\nstyles be at a risk of copying via simple prompting of today's popular\ntext-to-image generative models.",

In this\npaper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in\ngenerating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end,\nwe propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation\nby explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images\nand conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we\nuse a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding\ncondition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss\nbetween the input conditional control and extracted condition. A\nstraightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises\nand then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires\nstoring gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time\nand memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy\nthat deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the\nsingle-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive\ncosts associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward\nfine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly\nimproves controllability under various conditional controls. For example, it\nachieves improvements over ControlNet by 11.1% mIoU, 13.4% SSIM, and 7.6% RMSE,\nrespectively, for segmentation mask, line-art edge, and depth conditions.

Previous studies have predominantly\nconcentrated on aligning the intermediate statistics between the original and\ndistilled data, such as weight trajectory, features, gradient, BatchNorm, etc.\nIn this work, we consider addressing this task through the new lens of model\ninformativeness in the compression stage on the original dataset pretraining.\nWe observe that with the prior state-of-the-art SRe$^2$L, as model sizes\nincrease, it becomes increasingly challenging for supervised pretrained models\nto recover learned information during data synthesis, as the channel-wise mean\nand variance inside the model are flatting and less informative. We further\nnotice that larger variances in BN statistics from self-supervised models\nenable larger loss signals to update the recovered data by gradients, enjoying\nmore informativeness during synthesis. Building on this observation, we\nintroduce SC-DD, a simple yet effective Self-supervised Compression framework\nfor Dataset Distillation that facilitates diverse information compression and\nrecovery compared to traditional supervised learning schemes, further reaps the\npotential of large pretrained models with enhanced capabilities.

However, existing\nbenchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to\nenvironments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect\nthe diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the\nscope of tasks and agent scalability. To address this issue, we introduce\nOSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for\nmultimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and\ninteractive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows,\nand macOS. OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for\nassessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications.\nBuilding upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving\nreal web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning\nmultiple applications. Each task example is derived from real-world computer\nuse cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a\ncustom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation.\nExtensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld\nreveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer\nassistants. While humans can accomplish over 72.36% of the tasks, the best\nmodel achieves only 12.24% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and\noperational knowledge. Comprehensive analysis using OSWorld provides valuable\ninsights for developing multimodal generalist agents that were not possible\nwith previous benchmarks.

The approach is\nefficient and flexible, and the full training and verification procedure is\naccelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT.\nThe flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow us to demonstrate\nLyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based controllers\nand NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first time in\nliterature.

Nevertheless,\nexisting methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure\nwithin both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which\nbetter intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be\nderived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal\nrepresentations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high\ncomplexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data.\nRecently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising\napproach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low\ncomplexity.

SurvMamba is implemented with\na Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient\nintra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more\ndetailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an\nInteraction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal\ninteractive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival\nprediction.

    "abstract": "Brain decoding, a pivotal field in neuroscience, aims to reconstruct stimuli\nfrom acquired brain signals, primarily utilizing functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI). Currently, brain decoding is confined to a\nper-subject-per-model paradigm, limiting its applicability to the same\nindividual for whom the decoding model is trained. This constraint stems from\nthree key challenges: 1) the inherent variability in input dimensions across\nsubjects due to differences in brain size; 2) the unique intrinsic neural\npatterns, influencing how different individuals perceive and process sensory\ninformation; 3) limited data availability for new subjects in real-world\nscenarios hampers the performance of decoding models. In this paper, we present\na novel approach, MindBridge, that achieves cross-subject brain decoding by\nemploying only one model. Our proposed framework establishes a generic paradigm\ncapable of addressing these challenges by introducing biological-inspired\naggregation function and novel cyclic fMRI reconstruction mechanism for\nsubject-invariant representation learning. Notably, by cycle reconstruction of\nfMRI, MindBridge can enable novel fMRI synthesis, which also can serve as\npseudo data augmentation. Within the framework, we also devise a novel\nreset-tuning method for adapting a pretrained model to a new subject.\nExperimental results demonstrate MindBridge's ability to reconstruct images for\nmultiple subjects, which is competitive with dedicated subject-specific models.\nFurthermore, with limited data for a new subject, we achieve a high level of\ndecoding accuracy, surpassing that of subject-specific models. This advancement\nin cross-subject brain decoding suggests promising directions for wider\napplications in neuroscience and indicates potential for more efficient\nutilization of limited fMRI data in real-world scenarios.

Efforts to develop standards for auditing\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) systems have therefore understandably gained\nmomentum. However, we argue that creating auditing standards is not just\ninsufficient, but actively harmful by proliferating unheeded and inconsistent\nstandards, especially in light of the rapid evolution and ethical and safety\nchallenges of AI. Instead, the paper proposes the establishment of an AI Audit\nStandards Board, responsible for developing and updating auditing methods and\nstandards in line with the evolving nature of AI technologies. Such a body\nwould ensure that auditing practices remain relevant, robust, and responsive to\nthe rapid advancements in AI. The paper argues that such a governance structure\nwould also be helpful for maintaining public trust in AI and for promoting a\nculture of safety and ethical responsibility within the AI industry.\n  Throughout the paper, we draw parallels with other industries, including\nsafety-critical industries like aviation and nuclear energy, as well as more\nprosaic ones such as financial accounting and pharmaceuticals. AI auditing\nshould emulate those fields, and extend beyond technical assessments to include\nethical considerations and stakeholder engagement, but we explain that this is\nnot enough; emulating other fields' governance mechanisms for these processes,\nand for audit standards creation, is a necessity.

In this paper, we challenge this practice with an\nextensive empirical study. In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we\ncall post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying\npost-hoc transforms. This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise\nsettings. For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both\nensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs. Post-hoc reversal\ncan also prevent the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches\nbetween test loss and test error seen in base models. Preliminary analyses\nsuggest that these transforms induce reversal by suppressing the influence of\nmislabeled examples, exploiting differences in their learning dynamics from\nthose of clean examples. Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection,\na simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions\nsuch as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices. Our\nexperiments span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets.

By contrast to the object occlusion problem in the\neyelevel view, which impedes the SGG, the overhead view provides a new\nperspective that helps to promote the SGG by providing a clear perception of\nthe spatial relationships of objects in the ground scene. To fill in the gap of\nthe overhead view dataset, this paper constructs and releases an aerial image\nurban scene graph generation (AUG) dataset. Images from the AUG dataset are\ncaptured with the low-attitude overhead view. In the AUG dataset, 25,594\nobjects, 16,970 relationships, and 27,175 attributes are manually annotated.

Different from the traditional graph convolutional network, which has\nthe natural advantage of capturing the global context for SGG, the\nconvolutional layer in the LPG integrates the non-destructive initial features\nof the objects with dynamically updated neighborhood information to preserve\nthe local context under the premise of mining the global context. To address\nthe problem that there exists an extra-large number of potential object\nrelationship pairs but only a small part of them is meaningful in AUG, we\npropose the adaptive bounding box scaling factor for potential relationship\ndetection (ABS-PRD) to intelligently prune the meaningless relationship pairs.\nExtensive experiments on the AUG dataset show that our LPG can significantly\noutperform the state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of the proposed\nlocality-preserving strategy.",

These technologies have already been used to\ngenerate training data for Machine Learning (ML) models, and large\ntext-to-image models like DALL-E 2, Imagen, and Stable Diffusion are achieving\nremarkable results in realistic high-resolution image generation. Given these\ndevelopments, issues of data authentication in monitoring and verification\ndeserve a careful and systematic analysis: How realistic are synthetic images?\nHow easily can they be generated? How useful are they for ML researchers, and\nwhat is their potential for Open Science? In this work, we use novel DL models\nto explore how synthetic satellite images can be created using conditioning\nmechanisms. We investigate the challenges of synthetic satellite image\ngeneration and evaluate the results based on authenticity and state-of-the-art\nmetrics. Furthermore, we investigate how synthetic data can alleviate the lack\nof data in the context of ML methods for remote-sensing. Finally we discuss\nimplications of synthetic satellite imagery in the context of monitoring and\nverification.",

    "abstract": "The pace of scientific research, vital for improving human life, is complex,\nslow, and needs specialized expertise. Meanwhile, novel, impactful research\noften stems from both a deep understanding of prior work, and a\ncross-pollination of ideas across domains and fields. To enhance the\nproductivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the\nencyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines\nnovel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively\nrefining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing\nagents. Specifically, starting with a core scientific paper, ResearchAgent is\naugmented not only with relevant publications by connecting information over an\nacademic graph but also entities retrieved from a knowledge store derived from\nshared underlying concepts mined across numerous papers. Then, mimicking a\nscientific approach to improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage\nmultiple LLM-based ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback via\niterative revision processes. These reviewing agents are instantiated with\nhuman preference-aligned LLMs whose criteria for evaluation are elicited from\nactual human judgments via LLM prompting. We experimentally validate our\nResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showing\nits effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid ideas based on both\nhuman and model-based evaluation results. Our initial foray into AI-mediated\nscientific research has important implications for the development of future\nsystems aimed at supporting researchers in their ideation and\noperationalization of novel work.",

As this is a challenging task, it is often simplified for\nrobots by creating demonstrations from the first-person perspective.

Modeling the\nwireless sensor networks as heterogeneous graphs, we utilize the graph neural\nnetwork to learn representations of sites and sensors by aggregating features\nof neighbor nodes and extracting hierarchical graph features. Meanwhile, the\nmulti-head attention mechanism is leveraged to allow the sites to attend to\ninformation from sensor nodes, which highly improves the expressive capacity of\nthe learning model. Based on the node representations, a greedy policy is\nlearned to append the next best site in the solution incrementally.

    "abstract": "The creation of high-quality ontologies is crucial for data integration and\nknowledge-based reasoning, specifically in the context of the rising data\neconomy. However, automatic ontology matchers are often bound to the heuristics\nthey are based on, leaving many matches unidentified. Interactive ontology\nmatching systems involving human experts have been introduced, but they do not\nsolve the fundamental issue of flexibly finding additional matches outside the\nscope of the implemented heuristics, even though this is highly demanded in\nindustrial settings. Active machine learning methods appear to be a promising\npath towards a flexible interactive ontology matcher. However, off-the-shelf\nactive learning mechanisms suffer from low query efficiency due to extreme\nclass imbalance, resulting in a last-mile problem where high human effort is\nrequired to identify the remaining matches.\n  To address the last-mile problem, this work introduces DualLoop, an active\nlearning method tailored to ontology matching. DualLoop offers three main\ncontributions: (1) an ensemble of tunable heuristic matchers, (2) a short-term\nlearner with a novel query strategy adapted to highly imbalanced data, and (3)\nlong-term learners to explore potential matches by creating and tuning new\nheuristics. We evaluated DualLoop on three datasets of varying sizes and\ndomains. Compared to existing active learning methods, we consistently achieved\nbetter F1 scores and recall, reducing the expected query cost spent on finding\n90% of all matches by over 50%. Compared to traditional interactive ontology\nmatchers, we are able to find additional, last-mile matches. Finally, we detail\nthe successful deployment of our approach within an actual product and report\nits operational performance results within the Architecture, Engineering, and\nConstruction (AEC) industry sector, showcasing its practical value and\nefficiency.",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which incorporate PDEs as soft\nconstraints, train with a composite loss function that contains multiple\ntraining point types: different types of collocation points chosen during\ntraining to enforce each PDE and initial/boundary conditions, and experimental\npoints which are usually costly to obtain via experiments or simulations.\nTraining PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires\nselecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different\ntraining dynamics. Unlike past works that focused on the selection of either\ncollocation or experimental points, this work introduces PINN Adaptive\nColLocation and Experimental points selection (PINNACLE), the first algorithm\nthat jointly optimizes the selection of all training point types, while\nautomatically adjusting the proportion of collocation point types as training\nprogresses. PINNACLE uses information on the interaction among training point\ntypes, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN\ntraining dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We theoretically show\nthat the criterion used by PINNACLE is related to the PINN generalization\nerror, and empirically demonstrate that PINNACLE is able to outperform existing\npoint selection methods for forward, inverse, and transfer learning problems.",

While these LLMs display competitive performance on\nautomated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated\nwith a focus on a single language (English mostly). This is particularly true\nof text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of\ndomain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many\nlanguages. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain\nin four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish. This new corpus\nhas been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text\nmultilingual model for the medical domain. Additionally, we present two new\nevaluation benchmarks for all four languages with the aim of facilitating\nmultilingual research in this domain. A comprehensive evaluation shows that\nMedical mT5 outperforms both encoders and similarly sized text-to-text models\nfor the Spanish, French, and Italian benchmarks, while being competitive with\ncurrent state-of-the-art LLMs in English.",

In particular, nuPlan seems to be an expressive evaluation\nmethod since it is based on real-world data and closed-loop, yet it mostly\ncovers basic driving scenarios. This makes it difficult to judge a planner's\ncapabilities to generalize to rarely-seen situations.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive Decentraland parcels dataset, called\nIITP-VDLand, sourced from diverse platforms such as Decentraland, OpenSea,\nEtherscan, Google BigQuery, and various Social Media Platforms. Unlike existing\ndatasets which have limited attributes and records, IITP-VDLand offers a rich\narray of attributes, encompassing parcel characteristics, trading history, past\nactivities, transactions, and social media interactions. Alongside, we\nintroduce a key attribute in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which measures\nthe uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world. Addressing the\nsignificant challenge posed by the dispersed nature of this data across various\nsources, we employ a systematic approach, utilizing both available APIs and\ncustom scripts, to gather it. Subsequently, we meticulously curate and organize\nthe information into four distinct fragments: (1) Characteristics, (2) OpenSea\nTrading History, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions, and (4) Social Media. We\nenvisage that this dataset would serve as a robust resource for training\nmachine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world\nchallenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. The performance\nbenchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our\ndataset yields promising results, achieving a maximum R2 score of 0.8251 and an\naccuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier. The key\nfindings reveal that the ensemble models perform better than both deep learning\nand linear models for our dataset. We observe a significant impact of\ncoordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic\nindicators on the prediction of parcel prices.",

    "abstract": "Successful supply chain optimization must mitigate imbalances between supply\nand demand over time. While accurate demand prediction is essential for supply\nplanning, it alone does not suffice. The key to successful supply planning for\noptimal and viable execution lies in maximizing predictability for both demand\nand supply throughout an execution horizon. Therefore, enhancing the accuracy\nof supply predictions is imperative to create an attainable supply plan that\nmatches demand without overstocking or understocking. However, in complex\nsupply chain networks with numerous nodes and edges, accurate supply\npredictions are challenging due to dynamic node interactions, cascading supply\ndelays, resource availability, production and logistic capabilities.\nConsequently, supply executions often deviate from their initial plans. To\naddress this, we present the Graph-based Supply Prediction (GSP) probabilistic\nmodel. Our attention-based graph neural network (GNN) model predicts supplies,\ninventory, and imbalances using graph-structured historical data, demand\nforecasting, and original supply plan inputs. The experiments, conducted using\nhistorical data from a global consumer goods company's large-scale supply\nchain, demonstrate that GSP significantly improves supply and inventory\nprediction accuracy, potentially offering supply plan corrections to optimize\nexecutions.",

Studies of bias in LM\nresponses to open-ended prompts (where identity classifications are left\nunspecified) are lacking and have not yet been grounded in end-consumer harms.\nHere, we advance studies of generative LM bias by considering a broader set of\nnatural use cases via open-ended prompting. In this \"laissez-faire\" setting, we\nfind that synthetically generated texts from five of the most pervasive LMs\n(ChatGPT3.5, ChatGPT4, Claude2.0, Llama2, and PaLM2) perpetuate harms of\nomission, subordination, and stereotyping for minoritized individuals with\nintersectional race, gender, and/or sexual orientation identities (AI/AN,\nAsian, Black, Latine, MENA, NH/PI, Female, Non-binary, Queer). We find\nwidespread evidence of bias to an extent that such individuals are hundreds to\nthousands of times more likely to encounter LM-generated outputs that portray\ntheir identities in a subordinated manner compared to representative or\nempowering portrayals. We also document a prevalence of stereotypes (e.g.\nperpetual foreigner) in LM-generated outputs that are known to trigger\npsychological harms that disproportionately affect minoritized individuals.\nThese include stereotype threat, which leads to impaired cognitive performance\nand increased negative self-perception. Our findings highlight the urgent need\nto protect consumers from discriminatory harms caused by language models and\ninvest in critical AI education programs tailored towards empowering diverse\nconsumers.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, we have witnessed remarkable advancements in Code\nPre-trained Models (CodePTMs). These models achieved excellent representation\ncapabilities by designing structure-based pre-training tasks for code. However,\nhow to enhance the absorption of structural knowledge when fine-tuning CodePTMs\nstill remains a significant challenge. To fill this gap, in this paper, we\npresent Structure-aware Fine-tuning (SAT), a novel structure-enhanced and\nplug-and-play fine-tuning method for CodePTMs. We first propose a structure\nloss to quantify the difference between the information learned by CodePTMs and\nthe knowledge extracted from code structure. Specifically, we use the attention\nscores extracted from Transformer layer as the learned structural information,\nand the shortest path length between leaves in abstract syntax trees as the\nstructural knowledge. Subsequently, multi-task learning is introduced to\nimprove the performance of fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on four\npre-trained models and two generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed method as a plug-and-play solution. Furthermore, we observed that\nSAT can benefit CodePTMs more with limited training data.",

    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential\nas an intelligent agent. However, existing researches mainly focus on enhancing\nthe agent's reasoning or decision-making abilities through well-designed prompt\nengineering or task-specific fine-tuning, ignoring the procedure of exploration\nand exploitation. When addressing complex tasks within open-world interactive\nenvironments, these methods exhibit limitations. Firstly, the lack of global\ninformation of environments leads to greedy decisions, resulting in sub-optimal\nsolutions. On the other hand, irrelevant information acquired from the\nenvironment not only adversely introduces noise, but also incurs additional\ncost. This paper proposes a novel approach, Weak Exploration to Strong\nExploitation (WESE), to enhance LLM agents in solving open-world interactive\ntasks. Concretely, WESE involves decoupling the exploration and exploitation\nprocess, employing a cost-effective weak agent to perform exploration tasks for\nglobal knowledge. A knowledge graph-based strategy is then introduced to store\nthe acquired knowledge and extract task-relevant knowledge, enhancing the\nstronger agent in success rate and efficiency for the exploitation task. Our\napproach is flexible enough to incorporate diverse tasks, and obtains\nsignificant improvements in both success rates and efficiency across four\ninteractive benchmarks.",

While microscopic traffic simulators are valuable tools, they are\ncomputationally intensive and challenging to calibrate. Moreover, existing\nmachine-learning approaches struggle to provide lane-specific waveforms or\nadapt to intersection topology and traffic patterns. In this study, we propose\ntwo efficient and accurate \"Digital Twin\" models for intersections, leveraging\nGraph Attention Neural Networks (GAT). These attentional graph auto-encoder\ndigital twins capture temporal, spatial, and contextual aspects of traffic\nwithin intersections, incorporating various influential factors such as\nhigh-resolution loop detector waveforms, signal state records, driving\nbehaviors, and turning-movement counts. Trained on diverse counterfactual\nscenarios across multiple intersections, our models generalize well, enabling\nthe estimation of detailed traffic waveforms for any intersection approach and\nexit lanes. Multi-scale error metrics demonstrate that our models perform\ncomparably to microsimulations. The primary application of our study lies in\ntraffic signal optimization, a pivotal area in transportation systems research.\nThese lightweight digital twins can seamlessly integrate into corridor and\nnetwork signal timing optimization frameworks. Furthermore, our study's\napplications extend to lane reconfiguration, driving behavior analysis, and\nfacilitating informed decisions regarding intersection safety and efficiency\nenhancements.

    "abstract": "This study investigates whether OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 can\nforecast future events. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, we take\nadvantage of the fact that the training data at the time of our experiments\n(mid 2023) stopped at September 2021, and ask about events that happened in\n2022. We employed two prompting strategies: direct prediction and what we call\nfuture narratives which ask ChatGPT to tell fictional stories set in the future\nwith characters retelling events that happened in the past, but after ChatGPT's\ntraining data had been collected. We prompted ChatGPT to engage in\nstorytelling, particularly within economic contexts. After analyzing 100\ntrials, we find that future narrative prompts significantly enhanced\nChatGPT-4's forecasting accuracy. This was especially evident in its\npredictions of major Academy Award winners as well as economic trends, the\nlatter inferred from scenarios where the model impersonated public figures like\nthe Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell. As a falsification exercise, we\nrepeated our experiments in May 2024 at which time the models included more\nrecent training data. ChatGPT-4's accuracy significantly improved when the\ntraining window included the events being prompted for, achieving 100% accuracy\nin many instances. The poorer accuracy for events outside of the training\nwindow suggests that in the 2023 prediction experiments, ChatGPT-4 was forming\npredictions based solely on its training data. Narrative prompting also\nconsistently outperformed direct prompting. These findings indicate that\nnarrative prompts leverage the models' capacity for hallucinatory narrative\nconstruction, facilitating more effective data synthesis and extrapolation than\nstraightforward predictions.

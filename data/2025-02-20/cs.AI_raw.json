    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on some\ntasks, while exhibiting distinctly non-human-like behaviors on others. This\nraises the question of how well the LLM's learned representations align with\nhuman representations. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to the study\nof representation alignment: we adopt a method from research on activation\nsteering to identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., 'cat')\nand then analyze the corresponding activation patterns. Our findings reveal\nthat LLM representations closely align with human representations inferred from\nbehavioral data. Notably, this alignment surpasses that of word embeddings,\nwhich have been center stage in prior work on human and model alignment.\nAdditionally, our approach enables a more granular view of how LLMs represent\nconcepts. Specifically, we show that LLMs organize concepts in a way that\nreflects hierarchical relationships interpretable to humans (e.g.,\n'animal'-'dog').",

    "abstract": "User specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be\nremoved from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This\nrequires deleting or \"forgetting\" a set of data points from an already-trained\nmodel, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a\nbalance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's\nother abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to\npoor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE\n(Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection\nframework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the\nmodel damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on\nthe forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby\nminimizing model degradation after unlearning. We evaluate UPCORE across three\nstandard unlearning methods consistently achieving a superior balance between\nthe competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better\nevaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the\narea-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. We find that UPCORE\nimproves both standard metrics and AUC, benefitting from positive transfer\nbetween the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the\nforget set to points outside of it.",

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced\ndesign of the recommendation model can bring significant performance\nimprovement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a\nsignificantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two\nfundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and\ninference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which\nmay incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive\nin a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new\nusers/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External\nLarge Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges.\nSpecifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system\n(DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining\nhigh performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM)\nthat can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its\nbuilding cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the\ndata distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue.\nComprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public\ndatasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.",

Efficient deployment of such\ngenerative-AI models on GPUs has been demonstrated with dynamic quantization.\nHowever, resource-constrained devices cannot support dynamic quantization, and\nneed static quantization of the models for their efficient deployment on AI\nprocessors. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the post-training\nquantization of OpenSora\\cite{opensora}, a Video Diffusion Transformer, without\nrelying on dynamic quantization techniques. Our approach employs static\nquantization, achieving video quality comparable to FP16 and dynamically\nquantized ViDiT-Q methods, as measured by CLIP, and VQA metrics. In particular,\nwe utilize per-step calibration data to adequately provide a post-training\nstatically quantized model for each time step, incorporating channel-wise\nquantization for weights and tensor-wise quantization for activations. By\nfurther applying the smooth-quantization technique, we can obtain high-quality\nvideo outputs with the statically quantized models. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that static quantization can be a viable alternative to\ndynamic quantization for video diffusion transformers, offering a more\nefficient approach without sacrificing performance.",

However, their effectiveness in identifying rarer diseases,\nwhich are inherently more challenging to diagnose, remains an open question.\nRare disease performance is critical with the increasing use of LLMs in\nhealthcare settings. This is especially true if a primary care physician needs\nto make a rarer prognosis from only a patient conversation so that they can\ntake the appropriate next step. To that end, several clinical decision support\nsystems are designed to support providers in rare disease identification. Yet\ntheir utility is limited due to their lack of knowledge of common disorders and\ndifficulty of use.\n  In this paper, we propose RareScale to combine the knowledge LLMs with expert\nsystems. We use jointly use an expert system and LLM to simulate rare disease\nchats. This data is used to train a rare disease candidate predictor model.\nCandidates from this smaller model are then used as additional inputs to\nblack-box LLM to make the final differential diagnosis. Thus, RareScale allows\nfor a balance between rare and common diagnoses. We present results on over 575\nrare diseases, beginning with Abdominal Actinomycosis and ending with Wilson's\nDisease. Our approach significantly improves the baseline performance of\nblack-box LLMs by over 17% in Top-5 accuracy.

    "abstract": "Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex\nbranched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in\nautomating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched\nstructures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is\ndifficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While\nexisting research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable\nLinear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear\nObjects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs\ncreate complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot\nbe adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To\naddress these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched\nElastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework\nthat combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework\nto: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at\njunction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient\ncomputation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate\ndexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments\ndemonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and\ngeneralizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

While existing approaches rely on either\ncomplete concept removal through unlearning or simple output filtering, we\npropose Obliviate, a novel post-training technique that selectively prevents\nverbatim reproduction of specific text while preserving semantic understanding.\n  Obliviate operates by selecting tokens within memorized sequences and\nmodifying the model's probability distribution to prevent exact reproduction\nwhile maintaining contextual understanding. We evaluate Obliviate on multiple\nlarge language models (LLaMA-3.1 8B, LLaMA-3.1-instruct 8B, Qwen-2.5-7B, and\nYi-1.5 6B) across both synthetic memorization tasks and organic copyright\ncontent.

Our analysis also shows a strong correlation between contextualization\nand linearity, where linearity measures how closely the transformation from one\nlayer's embeddings to the next can be approximated by a single linear mapping.\nThese findings underscore the hidden importance of filler tokens in maintaining\ncontext. For further exploration, we present LLM-Microscope, an open-source\ntoolkit that assesses token-level nonlinearity, evaluates contextual memory,\nvisualizes intermediate layer contributions (via an adapted Logit Lens), and\nmeasures the intrinsic dimensionality of representations.

While\ntheoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a\nsuitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon,\nthese techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by\npractitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve\nthis problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility,\ncomputational tractability, and applicability to ''black-box'' dynamics by\nlearning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and\nincorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC\nparadigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new\nsampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal\ncontrol, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a\nCPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial\nsafety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even\nunder badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both\nsimulation and real-world hardware experiments.",

    "abstract": "We present an open-source benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing\nemotional boundary handling in Large Language Models (LLMs). Using a dataset of\n1156 prompts across six languages, we evaluated three leading LLMs (GPT-4o,\nClaude-3.5 Sonnet, and Mistral-large) on their ability to maintain appropriate\nemotional boundaries through pattern-matched response analysis. Our framework\nquantifies responses across seven key patterns: direct refusal, apology,\nexplanation, deflection, acknowledgment, boundary setting, and emotional\nawareness. Results demonstrate significant variation in boundary-handling\napproaches, with Claude-3.5 achieving the highest overall score (8.69/10) and\nproducing longer, more nuanced responses (86.51 words on average). We\nidentified a substantial performance gap between English (average score 25.62)\nand non-English interactions (< 0.22), with English responses showing markedly\nhigher refusal rates (43.20% vs. < 1% for non-English). Pattern analysis\nrevealed model-specific strategies, such as Mistral's preference for deflection\n(4.2%) and consistently low empathy scores across all models (< 0.06).\nLimitations include potential oversimplification through pattern matching, lack\nof contextual understanding in response analysis, and binary classification of\ncomplex emotional responses. Future work should explore more nuanced scoring\nmethods, expand language coverage, and investigate cultural variations in\nemotional boundary expectations.

To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an\nefficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse\nattention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity\npatterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework,\nwhere computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe\ndemonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context\nLLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these\noptimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly\nfree streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally,\nwe find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve\nlong-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We\nthen design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV\npages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM\nprefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining\nlong-context accuracy. Code is released at\nhttps://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.",

To avoid this, knowledge editing\nmethods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently\nmodifying a very small percentage of parameters. % However, those methods can\nlead to the problem of Specificity Failure: when the content related to the\nedited knowledge occurs in the context, it can inadvertently corrupt other\npre-existing knowledge. However, those methods can lead to the problem of\nSpecificity Failure, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely\ndegraded due to editing. Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure\nprimarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention\nscores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on\nspecific snippets within the context, which we denote as the Attention Drift\nphenomenon. To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet\neffective method Selective Attention Drift Restriction}(SADR), which introduces\nan additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to\nrestrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue\nfocus on the edited entity. Experiments on five frequently used strong LLMs\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly\nmitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks.",

Moreover, to achieve long outputs that\nmaintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given the high cost of collecting human\nfeedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which\nbreaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form\npreference pairs with the original outputs. Additionally, we develop\nMMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the\nlong-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with\nLongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this\nbenchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.

We show that these LLM\nchoices have a large effect on quality, but the search space is exponential. We\npropose LLMSelector, an efficient framework for model selection in compound\nsystems, which leverages two key empirical insights: (i) end-to-end performance\nis often monotonic in how well each module performs, with all other modules\nheld fixed, and (ii) per-module performance can be estimated accurately by an\nLLM. Building upon these insights, LLMSelector iteratively selects one module\nand allocates to it the model with the highest module-wise performance, as\nestimated by an LLM, until no further gain is possible. LLMSelector is\napplicable to any compound system with a bounded number of modules, and its\nnumber of API calls scales linearly with the number of modules, achieving\nhigh-quality model allocation both empirically and theoretically. Experiments\nwith popular compound systems such as multi-agent debate and self-refine using\nLLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 show that LLMSelector\nconfers 5%-70% accuracy gains compared to using the same LLM for all modules.",

Given the challenges in continual learning with large\nlanguage models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the\ndominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector\nretrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of\nhuman long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with\nvarious structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely\nsense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic\nfactual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this\nunintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms\nstandard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory\ntasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in\nHippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective\nonline use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the\neffectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in\nassociative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also\nexhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities.\nThis work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our\ncode and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.",

Yet the abilities of\ncurrent language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving\nthese abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method,\nMeta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains\nlanguage models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few\nin-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new\nword. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general\nword-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on\nhuman-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning,\ncomparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude\nmore data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability\nto discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words,\nand generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one\nor a few in-context examples.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization is identifying equivalent\nformulations, which can lead to more efficient solution strategies and deeper\ninsights into a problem's computational complexity. The need to automatically\nidentify equivalence between problem formulations has grown as optimization\ncopilots--systems that generate problem formulations from natural language\ndescriptions--have proliferated. However, existing approaches to checking\nformulation equivalence lack grounding, relying on simple heuristics which are\ninsufficient for rigorous validation. Inspired by Karp reductions, in this work\nwe introduce quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal criterion for determining when\ntwo optimization formulations are equivalent based on the existence of a\nmapping between their decision variables. We propose EquivaMap, a framework\nthat leverages large language models to automatically discover such mappings,\nenabling scalable and reliable equivalence verification. To evaluate our\napproach, we construct the first open-source dataset of equivalent optimization\nformulations, generated by applying transformations such as adding slack\nvariables or valid inequalities to existing formulations. Empirically,\nEquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial\nimprovements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence.",

One key aspect of creating such models is\nemploying 2D conflict maps that detect openings' locations in building facades.\nYet, in reality, these maps are often incomplete due to obstacles encountered\nduring laser scanning. To address this challenge, we introduce FacaDiffy, a\nnovel method for inpainting unseen facade parts by completing conflict maps\nwith a personalized Stable Diffusion model. Specifically, we first propose a\ndeterministic ray analysis approach to derive 2D conflict maps from existing 3D\nbuilding models and corresponding laser scanning point clouds. Furthermore, we\nfacilitate the inpainting of unseen facade objects into these 2D conflict maps\nby leveraging the potential of personalizing a Stable Diffusion model. To\ncomplement the scarcity of real-world training data, we also develop a scalable\npipeline to produce synthetic conflict maps using random city model generators\nand annotated facade images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FacaDiffy\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in conflict map completion compared to\nvarious inpainting baselines and increases the detection rate by $22\\%$ when\napplying the completed conflict maps for high-definition 3D semantic building\nreconstruction.

However, it has been\nshown that the dynamics of agents' interactions, even in simple two-player\ngames with few strategies, are incapable of reaching Nash equilibria,\nexhibiting complex and unpredictable behavior. Instead, evolutionary approaches\ncan describe the long-term persistence of strategies and filter out transient\nones, accounting for the long-term dynamics of agents' interactions. Our goal\nis to identify agents' joint strategies that result in stable behavior, being\nresistant to changes, while also accounting for agents' payoffs, in dynamic\ngames. Towards this goal, and building on previous results, this paper proposes\ntransforming dynamic games into their empirical forms by considering agents'\nstrategies instead of agents' actions, and applying the evolutionary\nmethodology $\\alpha$-Rank to evaluate and rank strategy profiles according to\ntheir long-term dynamics. This methodology not only allows us to identify joint\nstrategies that are strong through agents' long-term interactions, but also\nprovides a descriptive, transparent framework regarding the high ranking of\nthese strategies. Experiments report on agents that aim to collaboratively\nsolve a stochastic version of the graph coloring problem. We consider different\nstyles of play as strategies to define the empirical game, and train policies\nrealizing these strategies, using the DQN algorithm.

The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior\nof pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous\ntraffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on\nextra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such\nlabels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different\nbehaviors within the same class of agents.

From a causal inference perspective, CFP theory adopts\nabduction as a methodological foundation, employing Hilbert space for a dynamic\ncausal reasoning approach, where causal relationships are inferred abductively,\nand feature relationships evolve as emergent properties. Ultimately, CFP theory\nintroduces a novel AI modeling methodology that integrates Hilbert space,\nbackward causation, and Riemannian geometry, strengthening AI governance and\ntransparency in counterfactual reasoning.",

However,\nthe interaction among these sources remains theoretically underexplored. This\npaper takes the first step toward a rigorous analysis of multi-source training\nin conditional generative modeling, where each condition represents a distinct\ndata source. Specifically, we establish a general distribution estimation error\nbound in average total variation distance for conditional maximum likelihood\nestimation based on the bracketing number. Our result shows that when source\ndistributions share certain similarities and the model is expressive enough,\nmulti-source training guarantees a sharper bound than single-source training.\nWe further instantiate the general theory on conditional Gaussian estimation\nand deep generative models including autoregressive and flexible energy-based\nmodels, by characterizing their bracketing numbers. The results highlight that\nthe number of sources and similarity among source distributions improve the\nadvantage of multi-source training.

To address\nthese challenges, researchers have proposed federated unlearning (FU). However,\nexisting FU research has primarily focused on improving the efficiency of\nunlearning, with less attention paid to the potential privacy vulnerabilities\ninherent in these methods. To address this gap, we draw inspiration from\ngradient inversion attacks in FL and propose the federated unlearning inversion\nattack (FUIA). The FUIA is specifically designed for the three types of FU\n(sample unlearning, client unlearning, and class unlearning), aiming to provide\na comprehensive analysis of the privacy leakage risks associated with FU. In\nFUIA, the server acts as an honest-but-curious attacker, recording and\nexploiting the model differences before and after unlearning to expose the\nfeatures and labels of forgotten data. FUIA significantly leaks the privacy of\nforgotten data and can target all types of FU. This attack contradicts the goal\nof FU to eliminate specific data influence, instead exploiting its\nvulnerabilities to recover forgotten data and expose its privacy flaws.\nExtensive experimental results show that FUIA can effectively reveal the\nprivate information of forgotten data.

This has\npromoted research into machine unlearning that aims to remove information from\ntrained models. In particular, approximate unlearning seeks to achieve\ninformation removal by strategically editing the model rather than complete\nmodel retraining.\n  Recent work has shown that soft token attacks (STA) can successfully extract\npurportedly unlearned information from LLMs, thereby exposing limitations in\ncurrent unlearning methodologies.

This is the first\nGym environment for machine learning (ML) tasks, enabling research on\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for training such agents. MLGym-bench\nconsists of 13 diverse and open-ended AI research tasks from diverse domains\nsuch as computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning,\nand game theory. Solving these tasks requires real-world AI research skills\nsuch as generating new ideas and hypotheses, creating and processing data,\nimplementing ML methods, training models, running experiments, analyzing the\nresults, and iterating through this process to improve on a given task. We\nevaluate a number of frontier large language models (LLMs) on our benchmarks\nsuch as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5\nPro. Our MLGym framework makes it easy to add new tasks, integrate and evaluate\nmodels or agents, generate synthetic data at scale, as well as develop new\nlearning algorithms for training agents on AI research tasks. We find that\ncurrent frontier models can improve on the given baselines, usually by finding\nbetter hyperparameters, but do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms,\narchitectures, or substantial improvements. We open-source our framework and\nbenchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research\ncapabilities of LLM agents.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating AI safety requires statistically rigorous methods and risk metrics\nfor understanding how the use of AI affects aggregated risk. However, much AI\nsafety literature focuses upon risks arising from AI models in isolation,\nlacking consideration of how modular use of AI affects risk distribution of\nworkflow components or overall risk metrics. There is also a lack of\nstatistical grounding enabling sensitisation of risk models in the presence of\nabsence of AI to estimate causal contributions of AI. This is in part due to\nthe dearth of AI impact data upon which to fit distributions. In this work, we\naddress these gaps in two ways. First, we demonstrate how scenario modelling\n(grounded in established statistical techniques such as Markov chains, copulas\nand Monte Carlo simulation) can be used to model AI risk holistically. Second,\nwe show how lookalike distributions from phenomena analogous to AI can be used\nto estimate AI impacts in the absence of directly observable data. We\ndemonstrate the utility of our methods for benchmarking cumulative AI risk via\nrisk analysis of a logistic scenario simulations.",

This paper systematically examines jailbreak defenses by reframing\nthe standard generation task as a binary classification problem to assess model\nrefusal tendencies for both harmful and benign queries. We identify two key\ndefense mechanisms: safety shift, which increases refusal rates across all\nqueries, and harmfulness discrimination, which improves the model's ability to\ndistinguish between harmful and benign inputs.

In the initial stage,\nNarrativeGuide constructs a knowledge graph for attractions within a city, then\nconfigures the worldview, character setting, and exposition based on the\nknowledge graph. Using this foundation, the knowledge graph is combined to\ngenerate an independent scene unit for each attraction. During the itinerary\nplanning stage, NarrativeGuide models narrative-driven travel planning as an\noptimization problem, utilizing a genetic algorithm (GA) to refine the\nitinerary. Before evaluating the candidate itinerary, transition scripts are\ngenerated for each pair of adjacent attractions, which, along with the scene\nunits, form a complete script. The weighted sum of script coherence, travel\ntime, and attraction scores is then used as the fitness value to update the\ncandidate solution set. Experimental results across four cities, i.e., Nanjing\nand Yangzhou in China, Paris in France, and Berlin in Germany, demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in narrative coherence and cultural fit, alongside a\nnotable reduction in travel time and an increase in the quality of visited\nattractions. Our study highlights that incorporating external evolutionary\noptimization effectively addresses the limitations of large language models in\ntravel planning.",

To cope with the extreme limitations aboard nano-UAVs,\ne.g., low-resolution sensors and sub-100 mW computational power budget, we\ndesign, fine-tune, and optimize a tiny image-based convolutional neural network\n(CNN) for pest detection. Despite the small size of our CNN (i.e., 0.58\nGOps/inference), on our dataset, it scores a mean average precision (mAP) of\n0.79 in detecting harmful bugs, i.e., 14% lower mAP but 32x fewer operations\nthan the best-performing CNN in the literature. Our CNN runs in real-time at\n6.8 frame/s, requiring 33 mW on a GWT GAP9 System-on-Chip aboard a Crazyflie\nnano-UAV.

The global path planner\ndetermines the best route for the nano-UAV to sweep the entire area, while the\nlocal one runs up to 50 Hz aboard our nano-UAV and prevents collision by\nadjusting the short-distance path.

    "abstract": "Aligning Large Language Model (LLM) responses with human preferences is vital\nfor building safe and controllable AI systems. While preference optimization\nmethods based on Plackett-Luce (PL) and Bradley-Terry (BT) models have shown\npromise, they face challenges such as poor handling of harmful content,\ninefficient use of dispreferred responses, and, specifically for PL, high\ncomputational costs. To address these issues, we propose Hard Preference\nSampling (HPS), a novel framework for robust and efficient human preference\nalignment. HPS introduces a training loss that prioritizes the most preferred\nresponse while rejecting all dispreferred and harmful ones. It emphasizes\n\"hard\" dispreferred responses--those closely resembling preferred ones--to\nenhance the model's rejection capabilities. By leveraging a single-sample Monte\nCarlo sampling strategy, HPS reduces computational overhead while maintaining\nalignment quality. Theoretically, HPS improves sample efficiency over existing\nPL methods and maximizes the reward margin between preferred and dispreferred\nresponses, ensuring clearer distinctions. Experiments on HH-RLHF and PKU-Safety\ndatasets validate HPS's effectiveness, achieving comparable BLEU and reward\nscores while greatly improving reward margins and thus reducing harmful content\ngeneration.",

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aiming at\ndirectly generating the identifiers of the target candidates. Most existing\nmethods attempt to leverage prior knowledge embedded in Pre-trained Language\nModels (PLMs) to improve the recommendation performance. However, they often\nfail to accommodate the differences between the general linguistic knowledge of\nPLMs and the specific needs of recommendation systems. Moreover, they rarely\nconsider the complementary knowledge between the multimodal information of\nitems, which represents the multi-faceted preferences of users. To facilitate\nefficient recommendation knowledge transfer, we propose a novel approach called\nMultimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation (MQL4GRec). Our\nkey idea is to transform items from different domains and modalities into a\nunified language, which can serve as a bridge for transferring recommendation\nknowledge. Specifically, we first introduce quantitative translators to convert\nthe text and image content of items from various domains into a new and concise\nlanguage, known as quantitative language, with all items sharing the same\nvocabulary. Then, we design a series of quantitative language generation tasks\nto enrich quantitative language with semantic information and prior knowledge.\nFinally, we achieve the transfer of recommendation knowledge from different\ndomains and modalities to the recommendation task through pre-training and\nfine-tuning. We evaluate the effectiveness of MQL4GRec through extensive\nexperiments and comparisons with existing methods, achieving improvements over\nthe baseline by 11.18\\%, 14.82\\%, and 7.95\\% on the NDCG metric across three\ndifferent datasets, respectively.",

In the quest for more efficient\nquantum fault tolerance, a critical code parameter is the weight of\nmeasurements that extract information about errors to enable error correction:\nas higher measurement weights require higher implementation costs and introduce\nmore errors, it is important in code design to optimize measurement weight.\nThis underlies the surging interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC)\ncodes, the study of which has primarily focused on the asymptotic\n(large-code-limit) properties.

Traditional rule-based methods tend to limit the\ninherent flexibility of LLMs, as their predefined execution paths restrict the\nmodels' action space, particularly when the unexpected, out-of-workflow (OOW)\nqueries are encountered. Conversely, prompt-based methods allow LLMs to fully\ncontrol the flow, which can lead to diminished enforcement of procedural\ncompliance.

This\nrestriction leads to labor-intensive preprocessing and poor generalization. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a method for 3D regenerative morphing\nusing a 3D diffusion prior.

We then explore an Attention Fusion strategy to generate\nmore smooth morphing sequences. To further improve the plausibility of semantic\ninterpolation and the generated 3D surfaces, we propose two strategies: (a)\nToken Reordering, where we match approximate tokens based on semantic analysis\nto guide implicit correspondences in the denoising process of the diffusion\nmodel, and (b) Low-Frequency Enhancement, where we enhance low-frequency\nsignals in the tokens to improve the quality of generated surfaces.\nExperimental results show that our method achieves superior smoothness and\nplausibility in 3D morphing across diverse cross-category object pairs,\noffering a novel regenerative method for 3D morphing with textured\nrepresentations.",

    "abstract": "Neural code models (NCMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in\ncode intelligence tasks. Meanwhile, the security of NCMs and NCMs-based systems\nhas garnered increasing attention. In particular, NCMs are often trained on\nlarge-scale data from potentially untrustworthy sources, providing attackers\nwith the opportunity to manipulate them by inserting crafted samples into the\ndata. This type of attack is called a code poisoning attack (also known as a\nbackdoor attack). It allows attackers to implant backdoors in NCMs and thus\ncontrol model behavior, which poses a significant security threat. However,\nthere is still a lack of effective techniques for detecting various complex\ncode poisoning attacks.\n  In this paper, we propose an innovative and lightweight technique for code\npoisoning detection named KillBadCode. KillBadCode is designed based on our\ninsight that code poisoning disrupts the naturalness of code. Specifically,\nKillBadCode first builds a code language model (CodeLM) on a lightweight\n$n$-gram language model. Then, given poisoned data, KillBadCode utilizes CodeLM\nto identify those tokens in (poisoned) code snippets that will make the code\nsnippets more natural after being deleted as trigger tokens. Considering that\nthe removal of some normal tokens in a single sample might also enhance code\nnaturalness, leading to a high false positive rate (FPR), we aggregate the\ncumulative improvement of each token across all samples. Finally, KillBadCode\npurifies the poisoned data by removing all poisoned samples containing the\nidentified trigger tokens. The experimental results on two code poisoning\nattacks and four code intelligence tasks demonstrate that KillBadCode\nsignificantly outperforms four baselines. More importantly, KillBadCode is very\nefficient, with a minimum time consumption of only 5 minutes, and is 25 times\nfaster than the best baseline on average.",

Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs,\nincluding GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, and the medically fine-tuned UltraMedical,\nstruggle with this binary hallucination detection task, with the best model\nachieving an F1 score as low as 0.625 for detecting \"hard\" category\nhallucinations. Using bidirectional entailment clustering, we show that\nharder-to-detect hallucinations are semantically closer to ground truth.\nThrough experiments, we also show incorporating domain-specific knowledge and\nintroducing a \"not sure\" category as one of the answer categories improves the\nprecision and F1 scores by up to 38% relative to baselines.",

To address these challenges, we present AdaGraph-T3, a novel test-time\ntraining framework for cross-domain GAD.

Specifically, we investigate the\npost-correction of predictions generated from classifiers learned with noisy\nlabels. The reasons are two-fold.

We develop both unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised learning methods for our model. The extensive empirical study\npresents solid evidence to that our approach is able to consistently improve\nthe independent models and performs better than a number of existing methods\nacross various noisy label settings.

This work introduces SPRIG (Stackelberg Perception-Reinforcement\nlearning with Internal Game dynamics), a framework that models the internal\nperception-policy interaction within a single agent as a cooperative\nStackelberg game. In SPRIG, the perception module acts as a leader,\nstrategically processing raw sensory states, while the policy module follows,\nmaking decisions based on extracted features. SPRIG provides theoretical\nguarantees through a modified Bellman operator while preserving the benefits of\nmodern policy optimization. Experimental results on the Atari BeamRider\nenvironment demonstrate SPRIG's effectiveness, achieving around 30% higher\nreturns than standard PPO through its game-theoretical balance of feature\nextraction and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, generative models have achieved significant success in\nenhancement fundus images.However, the evaluation of these models still\npresents a considerable challenge. A comprehensive evaluation benchmark for\nfundus image enhancement is indispensable for three main reasons: 1) The\nexisting denoising metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) are hardly to extend to\ndownstream real-world clinical research (e.g., Vessel morphology consistency).\n2) There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation for both paired and unpaired\nenhancement methods, along with the need for expert protocols to accurately\nassess clinical value. 3) An ideal evaluation system should provide insights to\ninform future developments of fundus image enhancement. To this end, we propose\na novel comprehensive benchmark, EyeBench, to provide insights that align\nenhancement models with clinical needs, offering a foundation for future work\nto improve the clinical relevance and applicability of generative models for\nfundus image enhancement. EyeBench has three appealing properties: 1)\nmulti-dimensional clinical alignment downstream evaluation: In addition to\nevaluating the enhancement task, we provide several clinically significant\ndownstream tasks for fundus images, including vessel segmentation, DR grading,\ndenoising generalization, and lesion segmentation. 2) Medical expert-guided\nevaluation design: We introduce a novel dataset that promote comprehensive and\nfair comparisons between paired and unpaired methods and includes a manual\nevaluation protocol by medical experts. 3) Valuable insights: Our benchmark\nstudy provides a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of existing methods\nacross different downstream tasks, assisting medical experts in making informed\nchoices. Additionally, we offer further analysis of the challenges faced by\nexisting methods. The code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/Retinal-Research/EyeBench}",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making, yet\ntheir susceptibility to cognitive biases remains a pressing challenge. This\nstudy explores how personality traits influence these biases and evaluates the\neffectiveness of mitigation strategies across various model architectures. Our\nfindings identify six prevalent cognitive biases, while the sunk cost and group\nattribution biases exhibit minimal impact. Personality traits play a crucial\nrole in either amplifying or reducing biases, significantly affecting how LLMs\nrespond to debiasing techniques. Notably, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness\nmay generally enhance the efficacy of bias mitigation strategies, suggesting\nthat LLMs exhibiting these traits are more receptive to corrective measures.\nThese findings address the importance of personality-driven bias dynamics and\nhighlight the need for targeted mitigation approaches to improve fairness and\nreliability in AI-assisted decision-making.",

In this paper, we consider SNNs as ensembles of\ntemporal subnetworks that share architectures and weights, and highlight a\ncrucial issue that affects their performance: excessive differences in initial\nstates (neuronal membrane potentials) across timesteps lead to unstable\nsubnetwork outputs, resulting in degraded performance. To mitigate this, we\npromote the consistency of the initial membrane potential distribution and\noutput through membrane potential smoothing and temporally adjacent subnetwork\nguidance, respectively, to improve overall stability and performance. Moreover,\nmembrane potential smoothing facilitates forward propagation of information and\nbackward propagation of gradients, mitigating the notorious temporal gradient\nvanishing problem. Our method requires only minimal modification of the spiking\nneurons without adapting the network structure, making our method generalizable\nand showing consistent performance gains in 1D speech, 2D object, and 3D point\ncloud recognition tasks. In particular, on the challenging CIFAR10-DVS dataset,\nwe achieved 83.20\\% accuracy with only four timesteps. This provides valuable\ninsights into unleashing the potential of SNNs.",

Furthermore, we evaluated PartitionGPT on nine\nreal-world manipulation attacks that lead to a total loss of 25 million\ndollars, PartitionGPT effectively prevents eight cases, highlighting its\npotential for broad applicability and the necessity for secure program\npartitioning during smart contract development to diminish manipulation\nvulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of\nuniversal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for\nexploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal\nlearning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its\nestablished terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We\nfurther demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as\nminimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active\nInference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance\ngoal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we\nargue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not\nonly as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct\nconsequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e. the agent's intrinsic drive to\nmaintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main\ncontribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment,\ncuriosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain\nhigh-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to\nthe same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its\npower-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and\ncuriosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal\nmathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result\ncan be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of\nAGI.",

Popular alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback, have shown significant success in guiding models with greater\ncontrol. However, these methods require considerable computational resources,\nwhich is inefficient, and substantial collection of training data to\naccommodate the diverse and pluralistic nature of human preferences, which is\nimpractical. These limitations significantly constrain the scope and efficacy\nof both task-specific and general preference alignment methods. In this work,\nwe introduce On-the-fly Preference Alignment via Principle-Guided Decoding\n(OPAD) to directly align model outputs with human preferences during inference,\neliminating the need for fine-tuning. Our approach involves first curating a\nsurrogate solution to an otherwise infeasible optimization problem and then\ndesigning a principle-guided reward function based on this surrogate. The final\naligned policy is derived by maximizing this customized reward, which exploits\nthe discrepancy between the constrained policy and its unconstrained\ncounterpart. OPAD directly modifies the model's predictions during inference,\nensuring principle adherence without incurring the computational overhead of\nretraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that OPAD achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance in both general and personalized alignment tasks,\ndemonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

AID systems\nintegrate continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous\nglucose monitors (CGM) data, offering promise in reducing variability and\nincreasing glucose time-in-range.

    "abstract": "We solve a regularized weighted low-rank approximation problem by a\nstochastic gradient descent on a manifold. To guarantee the convergence of our\nstochastic gradient descent, we establish a convergence theorem on manifolds\nfor retraction-based stochastic gradient descents admitting confinements. On\nsample data from the Netflix Prize training dataset, our algorithm outperforms\nthe existing stochastic gradient descent on Euclidean spaces. We also compare\nthe accelerated line search on this manifold to the existing accelerated line\nsearch on Euclidean spaces.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study inverse game theory (resp. inverse multiagent\nlearning) in which the goal is to find parameters of a game's payoff functions\nfor which the expected (resp. sampled) behavior is an equilibrium. We formulate\nthese problems as generative-adversarial (i.e., min-max) optimization problems,\nfor which we develop polynomial-time algorithms to solve, the former of which\nrelies on an exact first-order oracle, and the latter, a stochastic one. We\nextend our approach to solve inverse multiagent simulacral learning in\npolynomial time and number of samples. In these problems, we seek a simulacrum,\nmeaning parameters and an associated equilibrium that replicate the given\nobservations in expectation. We find that our approach outperforms the\nwidely-used ARIMA method in predicting prices in Spanish electricity markets\nbased on time-series data.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a data-driven analysis of COVID-19 discourse on YouTube,\nexamining the sentiment, toxicity, and thematic patterns of video content\npublished between January 2023 and October 2024. The analysis involved applying\nadvanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis with\nVADER, toxicity detection with Detoxify, and topic modeling using Latent\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA). The sentiment analysis revealed that 49.32% of\nvideo descriptions were positive, 36.63% were neutral, and 14.05% were\nnegative, indicating a generally informative and supportive tone in\npandemic-related content. Toxicity analysis identified only 0.91% of content as\ntoxic, suggesting minimal exposure to toxic content. Topic modeling revealed\ntwo main themes, with 66.74% of the videos covering general health information\nand pandemic-related impacts and 33.26% focused on news and real-time updates,\nhighlighting the dual informational role of YouTube. A recommendation system\nwas also developed using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, refined by\nsentiment, toxicity, and topic filters to ensure relevant and context-aligned\nvideo recommendations. This system achieved 69% aggregate coverage, with\nmonthly coverage rates consistently above 85%, demonstrating robust performance\nand adaptability over time. Evaluation across recommendation sizes showed\ncoverage reaching 69% for five video recommendations and 79% for ten video\nrecommendations per video. In summary, this work presents a framework for\nunderstanding COVID-19 discourse on YouTube and a recommendation system that\nsupports user engagement while promoting responsible and relevant content\nrelated to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Index tracking is a popular passive investment strategy aimed at optimizing\nportfolios, but fully replicating an index can lead to high transaction costs.\nTo address this, partial replication have been proposed. However, the\ncardinality constraint renders the problem non-convex, non-differentiable, and\noften NP-hard, leading to the use of heuristic or neural network-based methods,\nwhich can be non-interpretable or have NP-hard complexity. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Differentiable Cardinality Constraint\n($\\textbf{DCC}$) for index tracking and introduce a floating-point\nprecision-aware method ($\\textbf{DCC}_{fpp}$) to address implementation issues.\nWe theoretically prove our methods calculate cardinality accurately and enforce\nactual cardinality with polynomial time complexity. We propose the range of the\nhyperparameter $a$ ensures that $\\textbf{DCC}_{fpp}$ has no error in real\nimplementations, based on theoretical proof and experiment.

    "abstract": "DLV2 is an AI tool for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning which supports\nAnswer Set Programming (ASP) - a logic-based declarative formalism,\nsuccessfully used in both academic and industrial applications. Given a logic\nprogram modelling a computational problem, an execution of DLV2 produces the\nso-called answer sets that correspond one-to-one to the solutions to the\nproblem at hand. The computational process of DLV2 relies on the typical Ground\n& Solve approach where the grounding step transforms the input program into a\nnew, equivalent ground program, and the subsequent solving step applies\npropositional algorithms to search for the answer sets. Recently, emerging\napplications in contexts such as stream reasoning and event processing created\na demand for multi-shot reasoning: here, the system is expected to be reactive\nwhile repeatedly executed over rapidly changing data. In this work, we present\na new incremental reasoner obtained from the evolution of DLV2 towards iterated\nreasoning. Rather than restarting the computation from scratch, the system\nremains alive across repeated shots, and it incrementally handles the internal\ngrounding process. At each shot, the system reuses previous computations for\nbuilding and maintaining a large, more general ground program, from which a\nsmaller yet equivalent portion is determined and used for computing answer\nsets. Notably, the incremental process is performed in a completely transparent\nfashion for the user.

Nonetheless, training-free methods for DIE encounter two\nprimary challenges: (1) understanding the complex relationship between layout\nand textual elements in VRDs, and (2) providing accurate guidance to\npre-trained models. To address these challenges, we propose Sample-centric\nIn-context Learning (SAIL) for DIE. SAIL introduces a fine-grained entity-level\ntextual similarity to facilitate in-depth text analysis by LLMs and\nincorporates layout similarity to enhance the analysis of layouts in VRDs.\nAdditionally, SAIL formulates a unified In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt\ntemplate for various sample-centric examples, enabling tailored prompts that\ndeliver precise guidance to pre-trained models for each sample. Extensive\nexperiments on FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE benchmarks with various base models\n(e.g., LLMs) indicate that our method outperforms training-free baselines, even\ncloser to the full-training methods. The results show the superiority and\ngeneralization of our method.",

    "abstract": "While face recognition (FR) models have brought remarkable convenience in\nface verification and identification, they also pose substantial privacy risks\nto the public. Existing facial privacy protection schemes usually adopt\nadversarial examples to disrupt face verification of FR models. However, these\nschemes often suffer from weak transferability against black-box FR models and\npermanently damage the identifiable information that cannot fulfill the\nrequirements of authorized operations such as forensics and authentication. To\naddress these limitations, we propose ErasableMask, a robust and erasable\nprivacy protection scheme against black-box FR models. Specifically, via\nrethinking the inherent relationship between surrogate FR models, ErasableMask\nintroduces a novel meta-auxiliary attack, which boosts black-box\ntransferability by learning more general features in a stable and balancing\noptimization strategy. It also offers a perturbation erasion mechanism that\nsupports the erasion of semantic perturbations in protected face without\ndegrading image quality. To further improve performance, ErasableMask employs a\ncurriculum learning strategy to mitigate optimization conflicts between\nadversarial attack and perturbation erasion. Extensive experiments on the\nCelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that ErasableMask achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance in transferability, achieving over 72% confidence\non average in commercial FR systems. Moreover, ErasableMask also exhibits\noutstanding perturbation erasion performance, achieving over 90% erasion\nsuccess rate.",

We design a neural network with four outputs, where\neach output approximates a function that corresponds to one of the unknown\nfunctions in the nonlinear system of differential equations describing the\nfour-dimensional ESD problem.

However, the method utilizing neural networks is considered a\nmodern and promising approach, as it effectively exploits the superior\ncomputational power of advanced computer systems, especially in solving complex\nproblems. Another advantage is that the neural network model, after being\ntrained, can solve the nonlinear system of differential equations across a\ncontinuous domain.

    "abstract": "Recent virtual try-on approaches have advanced by fine-tuning the pre-trained\ntext-to-image diffusion models to leverage their powerful generative ability.\nHowever, the use of text prompts in virtual try-on is still underexplored. This\npaper tackles a text-editable virtual try-on task that changes the clothing\nitem based on the provided clothing image while editing the wearing style\n(e.g., tucking style, fit) according to the text descriptions. In the\ntext-editable virtual try-on, three key aspects exist: (i) designing rich text\ndescriptions for paired person-clothing data to train the model, (ii)\naddressing the conflicts where textual information of the existing person's\nclothing interferes the generation of the new clothing, and (iii) adaptively\nadjust the inpainting mask aligned with the text descriptions, ensuring proper\nediting areas while preserving the original person's appearance irrelevant to\nthe new clothing. To address these aspects, we propose PromptDresser, a\ntext-editable virtual try-on model that leverages large multimodal model (LMM)\nassistance to enable high-quality and versatile manipulation based on\ngenerative text prompts. Our approach utilizes LMMs via in-context learning to\ngenerate detailed text descriptions for person and clothing images\nindependently, including pose details and editing attributes using minimal\nhuman cost. Moreover, to ensure the editing areas, we adjust the inpainting\nmask depending on the text prompts adaptively. We found that our approach,\nutilizing detailed text prompts, not only enhances text editability but also\neffectively conveys clothing details that are difficult to capture through\nimages alone, thereby enhancing image quality.

    "abstract": "Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural\nhuman skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language\nmodels (LLMs). We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data\nas a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction\nTuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical\ndatasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning\ntrajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs,\nenhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any\nsymbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical\nsteps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step\n(ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex\ninstructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in\nreasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother\nreasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods\nthat generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our\nmethod leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help\nLLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more\ntrustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT\nachieves an accuracy of 84.1% on GSM8K and 32.5% on MATH, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the\nperformance of tool-augmented methods.",

    "abstract": "Can robots imagine or generate maps like humans do, especially when only\nlimited information can be perceived like blind people? To address this\nchallenging task, we propose a novel group diffusion model (GDM) based\narchitecture for robots to generate point cloud maps with very limited input\ninformation.Inspired from the blind humans' natural capability of imagining or\ngenerating mental maps, the proposed method can generate maps without visual\nperception data or depth data. With additional limited super-sparse spatial\npositioning data, like the extra contact-based positioning information the\nblind individuals can obtain, the map generation quality can be improved even\nmore.Experiments on public datasets are conducted, and the results indicate\nthat our method can generate reasonable maps solely based on path data, and\nproduce even more refined maps upon incorporating exiguous LiDAR data.Compared\nto conventional mapping approaches, our novel method significantly mitigates\nsensor dependency, enabling the robots to imagine and generate elementary maps\nwithout heavy onboard sensory devices.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers\nmanipulate model behavior through data tampering or architectural\nmodifications. Traditional backdoor attacks involve injecting malicious samples\nwith specific triggers into the training data, causing the model to produce\ntargeted incorrect outputs in the presence of the corresponding triggers. More\nsophisticated attacks modify the model's architecture directly, embedding\nbackdoors that are harder to detect as they evade traditional data-based\ndetection methods. However, the drawback of the architectural modification\nbased backdoor attacks is that the trigger must be visible in order to activate\nthe backdoor. To further strengthen the invisibility of the backdoor attacks, a\nnovel backdoor attack method is presented in the paper. To be more specific,\nthis method embeds the backdoor within the model's architecture and has the\ncapability to generate inconspicuous and stealthy triggers. The attack is\nimplemented by modifying pre-trained models, which are then redistributed,\nthereby posing a potential threat to unsuspecting users. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on standard computer vision benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of this attack and highlight the stealthiness of its triggers,\nwhich remain undetectable through both manual visual inspection and advanced\ndetection tools.",

However, current FSDMC research often\nlacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally,\ndefect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images,\nand existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

    "abstract": "Smart grid, through networked smart meters employing the non-intrusive load\nmonitoring (NILM) technique, can considerably discern the usage patterns of\nresidential appliances. However, this technique also incurs privacy leakage. To\naddress this issue, we propose an innovative scheme based on adversarial attack\nin this paper. The scheme effectively prevents NILM models from violating\nappliance-level privacy, while also ensuring accurate billing calculation for\nusers. To achieve this objective, we overcome two primary challenges. First, as\nNILM models fall under the category of time-series regression models, direct\napplication of traditional adversarial attacks designed for classification\ntasks is not feasible. To tackle this issue, we formulate a novel adversarial\nattack problem tailored specifically for NILM and providing a theoretical\nfoundation for utilizing the Jacobian of the NILM model to generate\nimperceptible perturbations. Leveraging the Jacobian, our scheme can produce\nperturbations, which effectively misleads the signal prediction of NILM models\nto safeguard users' appliance-level privacy. The second challenge pertains to\nfundamental utility requirements, where existing adversarial attack schemes\nstruggle to achieve accurate billing calculation for users. To handle this\nproblem, we introduce an additional constraint, mandating that the sum of added\nperturbations within a billing period must be precisely zero. Experimental\nvalidation on real-world power datasets REDD and UK-DALE demonstrates the\nefficacy of our proposed solutions, which can significantly amplify the\ndiscrepancy between the output of the targeted NILM model and the actual power\nsignal of appliances, and enable accurate billing at the same time.\nAdditionally, our solutions exhibit transferability, making the generated\nperturbation signal from one target model applicable to other diverse NILM\nmodels.",

However, by default, they tend to generate \"average\" language\nwithout reflecting the ways in which people differ. Here, we propose a\nlightweight modification to the standard language model transformer\narchitecture - \"PsychAdapter\" - that uses empirically derived trait-language\npatterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic,\nand mental health characteristics (with or without prompting). We applied\nPsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and\nfound generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters\nevaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended\ntrait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7%\nfor depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to\nintroduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the\nfoundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer\nlayer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles,\nclinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological\nconditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or\neducation level without taking up LLM context windows.

In this paper, we propose a\nRL Self-augmented Large Language Model Feedback (RL-SaLLM-F) technique that\ndoes not rely on privileged information for online PbRL. RL-SaLLM-F leverages\nthe reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLM to generate\nself-augmented trajectories and provide preference labels for reward learning.\nFirst, we identify an failure issue in LLM-based preference discrimination,\nspecifically \"query ambiguity\", in online PbRL. Then LLM is employed to provide\npreference labels and generate self-augmented imagined trajectories that better\nachieve the task goal, thereby enhancing the quality and efficiency of\nfeedback. Additionally, a double-check mechanism is introduced to mitigate\nrandomness in the preference labels, improving the reliability of LLM feedback.\nThe experiment across multiple tasks in the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates\nthe specific contributions of each proposed module in RL-SaLLM-F, and shows\nthat self-augmented LLM feedback can effectively replace the impractical\n\"scripted teacher\" feedback.

    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), which operates solely on static datasets\nwithout further interactions with the environment, provides an appealing\nalternative to learning a safe and promising control policy. The prevailing\nmethods typically learn a conservative policy to mitigate the problem of\nQ-value overestimation, but it is prone to overdo it, leading to an overly\nconservative policy. Moreover, they optimize all samples equally with fixed\nconstraints, lacking the nuanced ability to control conservative levels in a\nfine-grained manner. Consequently, this limitation results in a performance\ndecline. To address the above two challenges in a united way, we propose a\nframework, Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which limits the\nQ-values in a mild range and enables adaptive control on the conservative level\nover each state-action pair, i.e., lifting the Q-values more for good\ntransitions and less for bad transitions. We theoretically analyze the\nconditions under which the conservative level of the learned Q-function can be\nlimited in a mild range and how to optimize each transition adaptively.\nMotivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel algorithm, ACL-QL,\nwhich uses two learnable adaptive weight functions to control the conservative\nlevel over each transition. Subsequently, we design a monotonicity loss and\nsurrogate losses to train the adaptive weight functions, Q-function, and policy\nnetwork alternatively. We evaluate ACL-QL on the commonly used D4RL benchmark\nand conduct extensive ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness and\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to existing offline DRL baselines.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge stored in large language models requires timely updates to reflect\nthe dynamic nature of real-world information. To update the knowledge, most\nknowledge editing methods focus on the low layers, since recent probes into the\nknowledge recall process reveal that the answer information is enriched in low\nlayers. However, these probes only and could only reveal critical recall stages\nfor the original answers, while the goal of editing is to rectify model's\nprediction for the target answers. This inconsistency indicates that both the\nprobe approaches and the associated editing methods are deficient. To mitigate\nthe inconsistency and identify critical editing regions, we propose a\ncontrast-based probe approach, and locate two crucial stages where the model\nbehavior diverges between the original and target answers: Information\nEnrichment in low layers and Probability Promotion in high layers. Building\nupon the insights, we develop the Joint knowledge Editing for information\nEnrichment and probability Promotion (JEEP) method, which jointly edits both\nthe low and high layers to modify the two critical recall stages. Considering\nthe mutual interference and growing forgetting due to dual modifications, JEEP\nis designed to ensure that updates to distinct regions share the same\nobjectives and are complementary. We rigorously evaluate JEEP by editing up to\nthousands of facts on various models, i.e., GPT-J (6B) and LLaMA (7B), and\naddressing diverse editing objectives, i.e., adding factual and counterfactual\nknowledge. In all tested scenarios, JEEP achieves best performances, validating\nthe effectiveness of the revealings of our probe approach and the designs of\nour editing method.

    "abstract": "The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications\n(e.g., rare wildlife observation) is limited by the small number of available\nimages. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective\nway to address this limitation. However, since the automatic generation process\nis uncontrollable, the generated images are usually limited in diversity, and\nsome of them are undesired. In this paper, we propose a human-guided image\ngeneration method for more controllable dataset expansion. We develop a\nmulti-modal projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate the\nexploration of both the original and generated images. Based on the\nexploration, users refine the prompts and re-generate images for better\nperformance. Since directly refining the prompts is challenging for novice\nusers, we develop a sample-level prompt refinement method to make it easier.\nWith this method, users only need to provide sample-level feedback (e.g., which\nsamples are undesired) to obtain better prompts. The effectiveness of our\nmethod is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the multi-modal\nprojection method, improved model performance in the case study for both\nclassification and object detection tasks, and positive feedback from the\nexperts.",

    "abstract": "Feedback is crucial for every design process, such as user interface (UI)\ndesign, and automating design critiques can significantly improve the\nefficiency of the design workflow. Although existing multimodal large language\nmodels (LLMs) excel in many tasks, they often struggle with generating\nhigh-quality design critiques -- a complex task that requires producing\ndetailed design comments that are visually grounded in a given design's image.\nBuilding on recent advancements in iterative refinement of text output and\nvisual prompting methods, we propose an iterative visual prompting approach for\nUI critique that takes an input UI screenshot and design guidelines and\ngenerates a list of design comments, along with corresponding bounding boxes\nthat map each comment to a specific region in the screenshot. The entire\nprocess is driven completely by LLMs, which iteratively refine both the text\noutput and bounding boxes using few-shot samples tailored for each step. We\nevaluated our approach using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, and found that human\nexperts generally preferred the design critiques generated by our pipeline over\nthose by the baseline, with the pipeline reducing the gap from human\nperformance by 50% for one rating metric. To assess the generalizability of our\napproach to other multimodal tasks, we applied our pipeline to open-vocabulary\nobject and attribute detection, and experiments showed that our method also\noutperformed the baseline.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) image\ngeneration quality but suffer from high latency and memory inefficiency, making\nthem difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. One major efficiency\nbottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of\nan image. However, not all image tokens are equally important, and certain\nlocalized areas require more computation, such as objects. To address this, we\npropose DiffCR, a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable\ncompression ratios, which automatically learns to dynamically route computation\nacross layers and timesteps for each image token, resulting in efficient DiTs.\nSpecifically, DiffCR integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing\nscheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is fine-tuned jointly with\nmodel weights to predict token importance scores. In this way, unimportant\ntokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable\nratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying\ncompression ratios from a zero initialization, resulting in large compression\nratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even\nuncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each\ndenoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern\nshows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes\nclearer. Extensive experiments on text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that\nDiffCR effectively captures dynamism across token, layer, and timestep axes,\nachieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency\ncompared to prior works.

    "abstract": "Ongoing efforts that span over decades show a rise of AI methods for\naccelerating scientific discovery, yet accelerating discovery in mathematics\nremains a persistent challenge for AI. Specifically, AI methods were not\neffective in creation of formulas for mathematical constants because each such\nformula must be correct for infinite digits of precision, with \"near-true\"\nformulas providing no insight toward the correct ones. Consequently, formula\ndiscovery lacks a clear distance metric needed to guide automated discovery in\nthis realm.\n  In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for categorization,\ncharacterization, and pattern identification of such formulas. The key to our\nmethodology is introducing metrics based on the convergence dynamics of the\nformulas, rather than on the numerical value of the formula. These metrics\nenable the first automated clustering of mathematical formulas. We demonstrate\nthis methodology on Polynomial Continued Fraction formulas, which are\nubiquitous in their intrinsic connections to mathematical constants, and\ngeneralize many mathematical functions and structures.\n  We test our methodology on a set of 1,768,900 such formulas, identifying many\nknown formulas for mathematical constants, and discover previously unknown\nformulas for $\\pi$, $\\ln(2)$, Gauss', and Lemniscate's constants. The uncovered\npatterns enable a direct generalization of individual formulas to infinite\nfamilies, unveiling rich mathematical structures. This success paves the way\ntowards a generative model that creates formulas fulfilling specified\nmathematical properties, accelerating the rate of discovery of useful formulas.",

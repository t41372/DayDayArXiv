    "abstract": "Modern life sciences research is increasingly relying on artificial\nintelligence approaches to model biological systems, primarily centered around\nthe use of machine learning (ML) models. Although ML is undeniably useful for\nidentifying patterns in large, complex data sets, its widespread application in\nbiological sciences represents a significant deviation from traditional methods\nof scientific inquiry. As such, the interplay between these models and\nscientific understanding in biology is a topic with important implications for\nthe future of scientific research, yet it is a subject that has received little\nattention. Here, we draw from an epistemological toolkit to contextualize\nrecent applications of ML in biological sciences under modern philosophical\ntheories of understanding, identifying general principles that can guide the\ndesign and application of ML systems to model biological phenomena and advance\nscientific knowledge. We propose that conceptions of scientific understanding\nas information compression, qualitative intelligibility, and dependency\nrelation modelling provide a useful framework for interpreting ML-mediated\nunderstanding of biological systems. Through a detailed analysis of two key\napplication areas of ML in modern biological research - protein structure\nprediction and single cell RNA-sequencing - we explore how these features have\nthus far enabled ML systems to advance scientific understanding of their target\nphenomena, how they may guide the development of future ML models, and the key\nobstacles that remain in preventing ML from achieving its potential as a tool\nfor biological discovery. Consideration of the epistemological features of ML\napplications in biology will improve the prospects of these methods to solve\nimportant problems and advance scientific understanding of living systems.",

To proactively mitigate such events, many transit agencies\nstation substitute (reserve) vehicles throughout their service areas, which\nthey can dispatch to augment or replace vehicles on routes that suffer\novercrowding or disruption. However, determining the optimal locations where\nsubstitute vehicles should be stationed is a challenging problem due to the\ninherent randomness of disruptions and due to the combinatorial nature of\nselecting locations across a city. In collaboration with the transit agency of\nNashville, TN, we address this problem by introducing data-driven statistical\nand machine-learning models for forecasting disruptions and an effective\nrandomized local-search algorithm for selecting locations where substitute\nvehicles are to be stationed. Our research demonstrates promising results in\nproactive disruption management, offering a practical and easily implementable\nsolution for transit agencies to enhance the reliability of their services.

This paper\nintroduces a novel solution that leverages contrastive learning to mitigate\nthis domain shift problem. Contrastive learning, a state-of-the-art\nself-supervised learning approach from deep learning, learns a distance metric\nsuch that positive pairs are closer (i.e. more similar) in the learned metric\nspace than negative pairs. When applied to RF fingerprinting, our model treats\nRF signals from the same transmission as positive pairs and those from\ndifferent transmissions as negative pairs. Through experiments on wireless and\nwired RF datasets collected over several days, we demonstrate that our\ncontrastive learning approach captures domain-invariant features, diminishing\nthe effects of domain-specific variations. Our results show large and\nconsistent improvements in accuracy (10.8\\% to 27.8\\%) over baseline models,\nthus underscoring the effectiveness of contrastive learning in improving device\nclassification under domain shift.",

If the user notices\nany unsatisfactory areas in the generated images, they can further refine the\nimages through model attention adjustment or image inpainting within the rich\nfeedback loop of PromptCharm. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of\nPromptCharm, we conducted a controlled user study with 12 participants and an\nexploratory user study with another 12 participants. These two studies show\nthat participants using PromptCharm were able to create images with higher\nquality and better aligned with the user's expectations compared with using two\nvariants of PromptCharm that lacked interaction or visualization support.",

    "abstract": "Human brain and behavior provide a rich venue that can inspire novel control\nand learning methods for robotics. In an attempt to exemplify such a\ndevelopment by inspiring how humans acquire knowledge and transfer skills among\ntasks, we introduce a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework named\nEpisodic Return Progress with Bidirectional Progressive Neural Networks\n(ERP-BPNN). The proposed ERP-BPNN model (1) learns in a human-like interleaved\nmanner by (2) autonomous task switching based on a novel intrinsic motivation\nsignal and, in contrast to existing methods, (3) allows bidirectional skill\ntransfer among tasks. ERP-BPNN is a general architecture applicable to several\nmulti-task learning settings; in this paper, we present the details of its\nneural architecture and show its ability to enable effective learning and skill\ntransfer among morphologically different robots in a reaching task. The\ndeveloped Bidirectional Progressive Neural Network (BPNN) architecture enables\nbidirectional skill transfer without requiring incremental training and\nseamlessly integrates with online task arbitration. The task arbitration\nmechanism developed is based on soft Episodic Return progress (ERP), a novel\nintrinsic motivation (IM) signal. To evaluate our method, we use quantifiable\nrobotics metrics such as 'expected distance to goal' and 'path straightness' in\naddition to the usual reward-based measure of episodic return common in\nreinforcement learning. With simulation experiments, we show that ERP-BPNN\nachieves faster cumulative convergence and improves performance in all metrics\nconsidered among morphologically different robots compared to the baselines.",

In this paper, we evaluate the abilities of LLMs to\nsolve formal synthesis benchmarks by carefully crafting a library of prompts\nfor the domain. When one-shot synthesis fails, we propose a novel enumerative\nsynthesis algorithm, which integrates calls to an LLM into a weighted\nprobabilistic search.

    "abstract": "Inspired by ideas from health risk assessment, this paper presents a new\nperspective for flood risk assessment. The proposed perspective focuses on\nthree pillars for examining flood risk: (1) inherent susceptibility, (2)\nmitigation strategies, and (3) external stressors. These pillars collectively\nencompass the physical and environmental characteristics of urban areas, the\neffectiveness of human-intervention measures, and the influence of\nuncontrollable external factors, offering a fresh point of view for decoding\nflood risks. For each pillar, we delineate its individual contributions to\nflood risk and illustrate their interactive and overall impact. The\nthree-pillars model embodies a shift in focus from the quest to precisely model\nand quantify flood risk to evaluating pathways to high flood risk. The shift in\nperspective is intended to alleviate the quest for quantifying and predicting\nflood risk at fine resolutions as a panacea for enhanced flood risk management.\nThe decomposition of flood risk pathways into the three intertwined pillars\n(i.e., inherent factors, mitigation factors, and external factors) enables\nevaluation of changes in factors within each pillar enhance and exacerbate\nflood risk, creating a platform from which to inform plans, decisions, and\nactions. Building on this foundation, we argue that a flood risk pathway\nanalysis approach, which examines the individual and collective impacts of\ninherent factors, mitigation strategies, and external stressors, is essential\nfor a nuanced evaluation of flood risk.

Every\nday the volume of training data is expanding and the number of user\ninteractions is constantly increasing. The exploration of larger and more\nexpressive models has become a necessary pursuit to improve user experience.\nHowever, this progression carries with it an increased computational burden. In\ncommercial settings, once a recommendation system model has been trained and\ndeployed it typically needs to be updated frequently as new client data arrive.\nCumulatively, the mounting volume of data is guaranteed to eventually make full\nbatch retraining of the model from scratch computationally infeasible.

This difficulty is\nin stark contrast to supervised learning: by leveraging a cross-entropy\nclassification loss, supervised methods have scaled reliably to massive\nnetworks. Observing this discrepancy, in this paper, we investigate whether the\nscalability of deep RL can also be improved simply by using classification in\nplace of regression for training value functions. We demonstrate that value\nfunctions trained with categorical cross-entropy significantly improves\nperformance and scalability in a variety of domains.

In response, the idea of distilling a dataset into a\ncondensed set of synthetic samples, i.e., a distilled dataset, emerged. One key\naspect is the selected architecture, usually ConvNet, for linking the original\nand synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if the employed\nmodel architecture differs from that used during distillation. Another\nchallenge is the generation of high-resolution images (128x128 and higher).

Our novel diffusion process is tailored for this task and\nsignificantly improves the gradient flow for distillation. By adjusting the\nnumber of diffusion steps, LD3M also offers a convenient way of controlling the\ntrade-off between distillation speed and dataset quality. Overall, LD3M\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2\np.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively, and on several ImageNet\nsubsets and high resolutions (128x128 and 256x256).",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer ranks within the top 10 most diagnosed cancers worldwide and\nis among the most expensive cancers to treat due to the high recurrence rates\nwhich require lifetime follow-ups. The primary tool for diagnosis is\ncystoscopy, which heavily relies on doctors' expertise and interpretation.\nTherefore, annually, numerous cases are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and\ntreated as urinary infections. To address this, we suggest a deep learning\napproach for bladder cancer detection and segmentation which combines CNNs with\na lightweight positional-encoding-free transformer and dual attention gates\nthat fuse self and spatial attention for feature enhancement. The architecture\nsuggested in this paper is efficient making it suitable for medical scenarios\nthat require real time inference.

Recent\nresearch shows that, despite limits in their intended use, people prompt LLMs\nin many different languages. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the basic\nmultilingual capabilities of state-of-the-art open LLMs beyond their intended\nuse. For this purpose, we introduce MultiQ, a new silver standard benchmark for\nbasic open-ended question answering with 27.4k test questions across a\ntypologically diverse set of 137 languages. With MultiQ, we evaluate language\nfidelity, i.e. whether models respond in the prompted language, and question\nanswering accuracy. All LLMs we test respond faithfully and/or accurately for\nat least some languages beyond their intended use. Most models are more\naccurate when they respond faithfully. However, differences across models are\nlarge, and there is a long tail of languages where models are neither accurate\nnor faithful.

    "abstract": "We present a new approach for Neural Optimal Transport (NOT) training\nprocedure, capable of accurately and efficiently estimating optimal\ntransportation plan via specific regularization on dual Kantorovich potentials.\nThe main bottleneck of existing NOT solvers is associated with the procedure of\nfinding a near-exact approximation of the conjugate operator (i.e., the\nc-transform), which is done either by optimizing over non-convex max-min\nobjectives or by the computationally intensive fine-tuning of the initial\napproximated prediction. We resolve both issues by proposing a new,\ntheoretically justified loss in the form of expectile regularisation which\nenforces binding conditions on the learning process of dual potentials. Such a\nregularization provides the upper bound estimation over the distribution of\npossible conjugate potentials and makes the learning stable, completely\neliminating the need for additional extensive fine-tuning. Proposed method,\ncalled Expectile-Regularised Neural Optimal Transport (ENOT), outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches on the established Wasserstein-2 benchmark\ntasks by a large margin (up to a 3-fold improvement in quality and up to a\n10-fold improvement in runtime). Moreover, we showcase performance of ENOT for\nvarying cost functions on different tasks such as image generation, showing\nrobustness of proposed algorithm.

    "abstract": "The fields of therapeutic application and drug research and development (R&D)\nboth face substantial challenges, i.e., the therapeutic domain calls for more\ntreatment alternatives, while numerous promising pre-clinical drugs have failed\nin clinical trials. One of the reasons is the inadequacy of Cross-drug Response\nEvaluation (CRE) during the late stages of drug R&D. Although in-silico CRE\nmodels bring a promising solution, existing methodologies are restricted to\nearly stages of drug R&D, such as target and cell-line levels, offering limited\nimprovement to clinical success rates. Herein, we introduce DeepCRE, a\npioneering AI model designed to predict CRE effectively in the late stages of\ndrug R&D. DeepCRE outperforms the existing best models by achieving an average\nperformance improvement of 17.7% in patient-level CRE, and a 5-fold increase in\nindication-level CRE, facilitating more accurate personalized treatment\npredictions and better pharmaceutical value assessment for indications,\nrespectively. Furthermore, DeepCRE has identified a set of six drug candidates\nthat show significantly greater effectiveness than a comparator set of two\napproved drugs in 5/8 colorectal cancer organoids. This demonstrates the\ncapability of DeepCRE to systematically uncover a spectrum of drug candidates\nwith enhanced therapeutic effects, highlighting its potential to transform drug\nR&D.",

    "abstract": "This note considers an innovative interdisciplinary methodology that bridges\nthe gap between the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics applied to the\nstudy of materials such as tellurium nanoparticles (TeNPs) and graphene and the\ncomplex dynamics of social systems. The basis for this approach lies in the\nmetaphorical parallels drawn between the structural features of TeNPs and\ngraphene and the behavioral patterns of social groups in the face of\nmisinformation. TeNPs exhibit unique properties such as the strengthening of\ncovalent bonds within telluric chains and the disruption of secondary structure\nleading to the separation of these chains. This is analogous to increased\ncohesion within social groups and disruption of information flow between\ndifferent subgroups, respectively. . Similarly, the outstanding properties of\ngraphene, such as high electrical conductivity, strength, and flexibility,\nprovide additional aspects for understanding the resilience and adaptability of\nsocial structures in response to external stimuli such as fake news. This\nresearch note proposes a novel metaphorical framework for analyzing the spread\nof fake news within social groups, analogous to the structural features of\ntelluric nanoparticles (TeNPs). We investigate how the strengthening of\ncovalent bonds within TeNPs reflects the strengthening of social cohesion in\ngroups that share common beliefs and values.

GPT-4 then utilizes them as\ndemonstrations to automatically generate Japanese instruction data. We also\nconstruct an evaluation benchmark containing 80 questions across 8 categories,\nusing GPT-4 to automatically assess the response quality of LLMs without human\nreferences. The empirical results suggest that the models fine-tuned on our\nGPT-4 self-instruct data significantly outperformed the Japanese-Alpaca across\nall three base pre-trained models. Our GPT-4 self-instruct data allowed the\nLLaMA 13B model to defeat GPT-3.5 (Davinci-003) with a 54.37\\% win-rate. The\nhuman evaluation exhibits the consistency between GPT-4's assessments and human\npreference. Our high-quality instruction data and evaluation benchmark have\nbeen released here.",

Taking e-commerce as an example, the\ntexts usually include amounts of domain-related words and have more grammar\nproblems, which leads to inferior performances of current NMT methods. To\naddress these problems, we collect two domain-related resources, including a\nset of term pairs (aligned Chinese-English bilingual terms) and a parallel\ncorpus annotated for the e-commerce domain.

These models are often used\ndirectly or integrated in product pipelines with no particular precautions,\nsince they are effectively just data in tensor form and considered safe. In\nthis paper, we raise awareness of a new machine learning supply chain threat\ntargeting neural networks. We introduce MaleficNet 2.0, a novel technique to\nembed self-extracting, self-executing malware in neural networks. MaleficNet\n2.0 uses spread-spectrum channel coding combined with error correction\ntechniques to inject malicious payloads in the parameters of deep neural\nnetworks. MaleficNet 2.0 injection technique is stealthy, does not degrade the\nperformance of the model, and is robust against removal techniques. We design\nour approach to work both in traditional and distributed learning settings such\nas Federated Learning, and demonstrate that it is effective even when a reduced\nnumber of bits is used for the model parameters. Finally, we implement a\nproof-of-concept self-extracting neural network malware using MaleficNet 2.0,\ndemonstrating the practicality of the attack against a widely adopted machine\nlearning framework. Our aim with this work is to raise awareness against these\nnew, dangerous attacks both in the research community and industry, and we hope\nto encourage further research in mitigation techniques against such threats.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML), addresses a multitude of complex issues in multiple\ndisciplines, including social sciences, finance, and medical research. ML\nmodels require substantial computing power and are only as powerful as the data\nutilized. Due to high computational cost of ML methods, data scientists\nfrequently use Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) to outsource computation\nto external servers. However, when working with private information, like\nfinancial data or health records, outsourcing the computation might result in\nprivacy issues. Recent advances in Privacy-Preserving Techniques (PPTs) have\nenabled ML training and inference over protected data through the use of\nPrivacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). However, these techniques are still\nat a preliminary stage and their application in real-world situations is\ndemanding. In order to comprehend discrepancy between theoretical research\nsuggestions and actual applications, this work examines the past and present of\nPPML, focusing on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-party\nComputation (SMPC) applied to ML. This work primarily focuses on the ML model's\ntraining phase, where maintaining user data privacy is of utmost importance. We\nprovide a solid theoretical background that eases the understanding of current\napproaches and their limitations. In addition, we present a SoK of the most\nrecent PPML frameworks for model training and provide a comprehensive\ncomparison in terms of the unique properties and performances on standard\nbenchmarks. Also, we reproduce the results for some of the papers and examine\nat what level existing works in the field provide support for open science. We\nbelieve our work serves as a valuable contribution by raising awareness about\nthe current gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications in\nPPML, specifically regarding open-source availability, reproducibility, and\nusability.",

    "abstract": "Social recommendation systems face the problem of social influence bias,\nwhich can lead to an overemphasis on recommending items that friends have\ninteracted with. Addressing this problem is crucial, and existing methods often\nrely on techniques such as weight adjustment or leveraging unbiased data to\neliminate this bias. However, we argue that not all biases are detrimental,\ni.e., some items recommended by friends may align with the user's interests.\nBlindly eliminating such biases could undermine these positive effects,\npotentially diminishing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\nCausal Disentanglement-based framework for Regulating Social influence Bias in\nsocial recommendation, named CDRSB, to improve recommendation performance. From\nthe perspective of causal inference, we find that the user social network could\nbe regarded as a confounder between the user and item embeddings (treatment)\nand ratings (outcome). Due to the presence of this social network confounder,\ntwo paths exist from user and item embeddings to ratings: a non-causal social\ninfluence path and a causal interest path. Building upon this insight, we\npropose a disentangled encoder that focuses on disentangling user and item\nembeddings into interest and social influence embeddings. Mutual\ninformation-based objectives are designed to enhance the distinctiveness of\nthese disentangled embeddings, eliminating redundant information. Additionally,\na regulatory decoder that employs a weight calculation module to dynamically\nlearn the weights of social influence embeddings for effectively regulating\nsocial influence bias has been designed. Experimental results on four\nlarge-scale real-world datasets Ciao, Epinions, Dianping, and Douban book\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of CDRSB compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of large language models, language-based forecasting has\nrecently emerged as an innovative approach for predicting human mobility\npatterns. The core idea is to use prompts to transform the raw mobility data\ngiven as numerical values into natural language sentences so that the language\nmodels can be leveraged to generate the description for future observations.\nHowever, previous studies have only employed fixed and manually designed\ntemplates to transform numerical values into sentences. Since the forecasting\nperformance of language models heavily relies on prompts, using fixed templates\nfor prompting may limit the forecasting capability of language models. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework for prompt mining in language-based\nmobility forecasting, aiming to explore diverse prompt design strategies.\nSpecifically, the framework includes a prompt generation stage based on the\ninformation entropy of prompts and a prompt refinement stage to integrate\nmechanisms such as the chain of thought. Experimental results on real-world\nlarge-scale data demonstrate the superiority of generated prompts from our\nprompt mining pipeline.

However, in order to\nprotect user privacy and optimize utility, it is also crucial for LLMRec to\nintentionally forget specific user data, which is generally referred to as\nrecommendation unlearning. In the era of LLMs, recommendation unlearning poses\nnew challenges for LLMRec in terms of \\textit{inefficiency} and\n\\textit{ineffectiveness}. Existing unlearning methods require updating billions\nof parameters in LLMRec, which is costly and time-consuming. Besides, they\nalways impact the model utility during the unlearning process.

To solve such problems, in\nthis paper, we (1) propose DLP-GAN (Draw Modern Chinese Landscape Photos with\nGenerative Adversarial Network), an unsupervised cross-domain image translation\nframework with a novel asymmetric cycle mapping, and (2) introduce a generator\nbased on a dense-fusion module to match different translation directions.\nMoreover, a dual-consistency loss is proposed to balance the realism and\nabstraction of model painting. In this way, our model can draw landscape photos\nand sketches in the modern sense. Finally, based on our collection of modern\nlandscape and sketch datasets, we compare the images generated by our model\nwith other benchmarks. Extensive experiments including user studies show that\nour model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, operator learning, particularly the DeepONet, has received\nmuch attention for efficiently learning complex mappings between input and\noutput functions across diverse fields. However, in practical scenarios with\nlimited and noisy data, accessing the uncertainty in DeepONet predictions\nbecomes essential, especially in mission-critical or safety-critical\napplications. Existing methods, either computationally intensive or yielding\nunsatisfactory uncertainty quantification, leave room for developing efficient\nand informative uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques tailored for\nDeepONets. In this work, we proposed a novel inference approach for efficient\nUQ for operator learning by harnessing the power of the Ensemble Kalman\nInversion (EKI) approach. EKI, known for its derivative-free, noise-robust, and\nhighly parallelizable feature, has demonstrated its advantages for UQ for\nphysics-informed neural networks [28]. Our innovative application of EKI\nenables us to efficiently train ensembles of DeepONets while obtaining\ninformative uncertainty estimates for the output of interest. We deploy a\nmini-batch variant of EKI to accommodate larger datasets, mitigating the\ncomputational demand due to large datasets during the training stage.\nFurthermore, we introduce a heuristic method to estimate the artificial\ndynamics covariance, thereby improving our uncertainty estimates. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed methodology\nacross various benchmark problems, showcasing its potential to address the\npressing challenges of uncertainty quantification in DeepONets, especially for\npractical applications with limited and noisy data.",

Furthermore, each LoRA model can be iteratively adapted\nto a new domain, allowing for quick domain-specific adaptation.

    "abstract": "Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) targets knowledge transfer in the\npresence of both covariate and label shifts. Recently, Source-free Universal\nDomain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) has emerged to achieve UniDA without access to\nsource data, which tends to be more practical due to data protection policies.\nThe main challenge lies in determining whether covariate-shifted samples belong\nto target-private unknown categories. Existing methods tackle this either\nthrough hand-crafted thresholding or by developing time-consuming iterative\nclustering strategies. In this paper, we propose a new idea of LEArning\nDecomposition (LEAD), which decouples features into source-known and -unknown\ncomponents to identify target-private data. Technically, LEAD initially\nleverages the orthogonal decomposition analysis for feature decomposition.\nThen, LEAD builds instance-level decision boundaries to adaptively identify\ntarget-private data. Extensive experiments across various UniDA scenarios have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of LEAD. Notably, in the OPDA\nscenario on VisDA dataset, LEAD outperforms GLC by 3.5% overall H-score and\nreduces 75% time to derive pseudo-labeling decision boundaries. Besides, LEAD\nis also appealing in that it is complementary to most existing methods. The\ncode is available at https://github.com/ispc-lab/LEAD.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the role of AI, yet pose\npotential social risks. To steer LLMs towards human preference, alignment\ntechnologies have been introduced and gained increasing attention.\nNevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on high-quality positive-negative\ntraining pairs, suffering from noisy positive responses that are barely\ndistinguishable from negative ones. Given recent LLMs' proficiency in\ngenerating helpful responses, this work pivots towards a new research question:\ncan we achieve alignment using solely human-annotated negative samples,\npreserving helpfulness while reducing harmfulness? For this purpose, we propose\nDistributional Dispreference Optimization (D$^2$O), which maximizes the\ndiscrepancy between dispreferred responses and the generated non-negative ones.\nIn this way, D$^2$O effectively eschews harmful information without\nincorporating noisy positive samples, while avoiding collapse using\nself-generated responses as anchors. We demonstrate that D$^2$O can be regarded\nas learning a distributional preference model reflecting human dispreference\nagainst negative responses, which is theoretically an upper bound of the\ninstance-level DPO. Extensive experiments manifest that our method achieves\ncomparable generation quality and surpasses the latest strong baselines in\nproducing less harmful and more informative responses with better training\nstability and faster convergence.",

The design of sparse RSNNs with\nfewer neurons and synapses helps reduce the computational complexity of RSNNs.\nTraditionally, sparse SNNs are obtained by first training a dense and complex\nSNN for a target task, and, then, pruning neurons with low activity\n(activity-based pruning) while maintaining task performance. In contrast, this\npaper presents a task-agnostic methodology for designing sparse RSNNs by\npruning a large randomly initialized model. We introduce a novel Lyapunov Noise\nPruning (LNP) algorithm that uses graph sparsification methods and utilizes\nLyapunov exponents to design a stable sparse RSNN from a randomly initialized\nRSNN. We show that the LNP can leverage diversity in neuronal timescales to\ndesign a sparse Heterogeneous RSNN (HRSNN). Further, we show that the same\nsparse HRSNN model can be trained for different tasks, such as image\nclassification and temporal prediction. We experimentally show that, in spite\nof being task-agnostic, LNP increases computational efficiency (fewer neurons\nand synapses) and prediction performance of RSNNs compared to traditional\nactivity-based pruning of trained dense models.",

However, there is still debate about how\nAI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) that can be applied to many\ntasks, behave compared to humans in high-stakes military decision-making\nscenarios with the potential for increased risks towards escalation. To test\nthis potential and scrutinize the use of LLMs for such purposes, we use a new\nwargame experiment with 214 national security experts designed to examine\ncrisis escalation in a fictional U.S.-China scenario and compare the behavior\nof human player teams to LLM-simulated team responses in separate simulations.\nHere, we find that the LLM-simulated responses can be more aggressive and\nsignificantly affected by changes in the scenario. We show a considerable\nhigh-level agreement in the LLM and human responses and significant\nquantitative and qualitative differences in individual actions and strategic\ntendencies. These differences depend on intrinsic biases in LLMs regarding the\nappropriate level of violence following strategic instructions, the choice of\nLLM, and whether the LLMs are tasked to decide for a team of players directly\nor first to simulate dialog between a team of players. When simulating the\ndialog, the discussions lack quality and maintain a farcical harmony. The LLM\nsimulations cannot account for human player characteristics, showing no\nsignificant difference even for extreme traits, such as \"pacifist\" or\n\"aggressive sociopath.\" When probing behavioral consistency across individual\nmoves of the simulation, the tested LLMs deviated from each other but generally\nshowed somewhat consistent behavior.

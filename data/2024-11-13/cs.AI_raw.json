For deals with 24 cards remaining to be played ($10^{27}$ states,\nwhich can be reduced to $10^{15}$ states using preexisting techniques), we\nstrongly solve all deals. The setrograde algorithm performs a factor of $10^3$\nfewer search operations than a standard retrograde algorithm, producing a\ndatabase with a factor of $10^4$ fewer entries.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language\nunderstanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of\nmultilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current\nstate-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed\nlanguages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of\nmultilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention\nto date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel\ngeneral-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to\nhandle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in\nthis paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate\nannotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability\nof LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation\ntasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI\nfeedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks.\nThird, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world\ndatasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform\nstate-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated\nby human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a\nfirst step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking\nand handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components.\nTraditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras\nor 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors\nhave weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D\nsensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can\nundermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems.\nTo address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining\nan red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are\ncalibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two\nhardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to\nprocess both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster\nR-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The\nresults show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only\nand RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More\nspecifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean\nPrecision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the\ndepth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%.\nHence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in\nservice to smart manufacturing applications.",

Conventional methods aimed at\ncountering these challenges show limited resilience to the uncertainties\ncreated by these phenomena. In response, in this paper, we introduce SAFELOC, a\nnovel framework that not only minimizes localization errors under these\nchallenging conditions but also ensures model compactness for efficient mobile\ndevice deployment. Our framework targets a distributed and co-operative\nlearning environment that uses federated learning (FL) to preserve user data\nprivacy and assumes heterogeneous mobile devices carried by users (just like in\nmost real-world scenarios). Within this heterogeneous FL context, SAFELOC\nintroduces a novel fused neural network architecture that performs data\npoisoning detection and localization, with a low model footprint. Additionally,\na dynamic saliency map-based aggregation strategy is designed to adapt based on\nthe severity of the detected data poisoning scenario. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that SAFELOC achieves improvements of up to 5.9x in mean\nlocalization error, 7.8x in worst-case localization error, and a 2.1x reduction\nin model inference latency compared to state-of-the-art indoor localization\nframeworks, across diverse building floorplans, mobile devices, and ML data\npoisoning attack scenarios.",

We propose a novel 4D\nGaussian Splatting (4DGS) algorithm for dynamic scenes from casually recorded\nmonocular videos. To overcome the overfitting problem of existing work for\nthese real-world videos, we introduce an uncertainty-aware regularization that\nidentifies uncertain regions with few observations and selectively imposes\nadditional priors based on diffusion models and depth smoothness on such\nregions. This approach improves both the performance of novel view synthesis\nand the quality of training image reconstruction. We also identify the\ninitialization problem of 4DGS in fast-moving dynamic regions, where the\nStructure from Motion (SfM) algorithm fails to provide reliable 3D landmarks.\nTo initialize Gaussian primitives in such regions, we present a dynamic region\ndensification method using the estimated depth maps and scene flow. Our\nexperiments show that the proposed method improves the performance of 4DGS\nreconstruction from a video captured by a handheld monocular camera and also\nexhibits promising results in few-shot static scene reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in\nprotein modeling and design, yet their internal mechanisms for predicting\nstructure and function remain poorly understood. Here we present a systematic\napproach to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse\nautoencoders (SAEs). By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we\nidentify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that\nstrongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding\nsites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining\nindividual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear\nconceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent\nmost concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show\nthat ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations\nand propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel\nlatent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate\nhow these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases\nand enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results\ndemonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein\nbiology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these\nlatent features. In the process, we recover both known biology and potentially\nnew protein motifs.

    "abstract": "Relationships of cause and effect are of prime importance for explaining\nscientific phenomena. Often, rather than just understanding the effects of\ncauses, researchers also wish to understand how a cause $X$ affects an outcome\n$Y$ mechanistically -- i.e., what are the causal pathways that are activated\nbetween $X$ and $Y$. For analyzing such questions, a range of methods has been\ndeveloped over decades under the rubric of causal mediation analysis.\nTraditional mediation analysis focuses on decomposing the average treatment\neffect (ATE) into direct and indirect effects, and therefore focuses on the ATE\nas the central quantity. This corresponds to providing explanations for\nassociations in the interventional regime, such as when the treatment $X$ is\nrandomized. Commonly, however, it is of interest to explain associations in the\nobservational regime, and not just in the interventional regime. In this paper,\nwe introduce \\text{variation analysis}, an extension of mediation analysis that\nfocuses on the total variation (TV) measure between $X$ and $Y$, written as\n$\\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_1] - \\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_0]$. The TV measure\nencompasses both causal and confounded effects, as opposed to the ATE which\nonly encompasses causal (direct and mediated) variations. In this way, the TV\nmeasure is suitable for providing explanations in the natural regime and\nanswering questions such as ``why is $X$ associated with $Y$?''. Our focus is\non decomposing the TV measure, in a way that explicitly includes direct,\nindirect, and confounded variations. Furthermore, we also decompose the TV\nmeasure to include interaction terms between these different pathways.\nSubsequently, interaction testing is introduced, involving hypothesis tests to\ndetermine if interaction terms are significantly different from zero. If\ninteractions are not significant, more parsimonious decompositions of the TV\nmeasure can be used.",

    "abstract": "While machine-learned models are now routinely employed to facilitate\nastronomical inquiry, model inputs tend to be limited to a primary data source\n(namely images or time series) and, in the more advanced approaches, some\nmetadata. Yet with the growing use of wide-field, multiplexed observational\nresources, individual sources of interest often have a broad range of\nobservational modes available. Here we construct an astronomical multimodal\ndataset and propose AstroM$^3$, a self-supervised pre-training approach that\nenables a model to learn from multiple modalities simultaneously. Specifically,\nwe extend the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to a trimodal\nsetting, allowing the integration of time-series photometry data, spectra, and\nastrophysical metadata. In a fine-tuning supervised setting, our results\ndemonstrate that CLIP pre-training improves classification performance for\ntime-series photometry, where accuracy increases from 84.6% to 91.5%.\nFurthermore, CLIP boosts classification accuracy by up to 12.6% when the\navailability of labeled data is limited, showing the effectiveness of\nleveraging larger corpora of unlabeled data. In addition to fine-tuned\nclassification, we can use the trained model in other downstream tasks that are\nnot explicitly contemplated during the construction of the self-supervised\nmodel. In particular we show the efficacy of using the learned embeddings for\nmisclassifications identification, similarity search, and anomaly detection.\nOne surprising highlight is the \"rediscovery\" of Mira subtypes and two\nRotational variable subclasses using manifold learning and dimension reduction\nalgorithm.

    "abstract": "Wireless ray-tracing (RT) is emerging as a key tool for three-dimensional\n(3D) wireless channel modeling, driven by advances in graphical rendering.\nCurrent approaches struggle to accurately model beyond 5G (B5G) network\nsignaling, which often operates at higher frequencies and is more susceptible\nto environmental conditions and changes. Existing online learning solutions\nrequire real-time environmental supervision during training, which is both\ncostly and incompatible with GPU-based processing. In response, we propose a\nnovel approach that redefines ray trajectory generation as a sequential\ndecision-making problem, leveraging generative models to jointly learn the\noptical, physical, and signal properties within each designated environment.\nOur work introduces the Scene-Aware Neural Decision Wireless Channel Raytracing\nHierarchy (SANDWICH), an innovative offline, fully differentiable approach that\ncan be trained entirely on GPUs. SANDWICH offers superior performance compared\nto existing online learning methods, outperforms the baseline by 4e^-2 radian\nin RT accuracy, and only fades 0.5 dB away from toplined channel gain\nestimation.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a Graph Attention Convolutional Network (GACN) for flow\nreconstruction from very sparse data in time-varying geometries. The model\nincorporates a feature propagation algorithm as a preprocessing step to handle\nextremely sparse inputs, leveraging information from neighboring nodes to\ninitialize missing features. In addition, a binary indicator is introduced as a\nvalidity mask to distinguish between the original and propagated data points,\nenabling more effective learning from sparse inputs. Trained on a unique data\nset of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a motored engine at a technically\nrelevant operating condition, the GACN shows robust performance across\ndifferent resolutions and domain sizes and can effectively handle unstructured\ndata and variable input sizes. The model is tested on previously unseen DNS\ndata as well as on an experimental data set from Particle Image Velocimetry\n(PIV) measurements that were not considered during training. A comparative\nanalysis shows that the GACN consistently outperforms both a conventional\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) and cubic interpolation methods on the DNS\nand PIV test sets by achieving lower reconstruction errors and better capturing\nfine-scale turbulent structures. In particular, the GACN effectively\nreconstructs flow fields from domains up to 14 times larger than those observed\nduring training, with the performance advantage increasing for larger domains.",

In this paper, we address this question by analyzing\nlatent representations (latents) during a word translation task in\ntransformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source\ntranslation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target\ntranslation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in\nthe latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on\nthis insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can\nchange the concept without changing the language and vice versa through\nactivation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean over\nlatents across different languages does not impair and instead improves the\nmodels' performance in translating the concept.

However, for challenging problems, it remains difficult to train models\nto perform program synthesis in one shot, making test-time search essential.\nMost neural methods lack structured search mechanisms during inference, relying\ninstead on stochastic sampling or gradient updates, which can be inefficient.\nIn this work, we propose the Latent Program Network (LPN), a general algorithm\nfor program induction that learns a distribution over latent programs in a\ncontinuous space, enabling efficient search and test-time adaptation. We\nexplore how to train these networks to optimize for test-time computation and\ndemonstrate the use of gradient-based search both during training and at test\ntime. We evaluate LPN on ARC-AGI, a program synthesis benchmark that evaluates\nperformance by generalizing programs to new inputs rather than explaining the\nunderlying specification. We show that LPN can generalize beyond its training\ndistribution and adapt to unseen tasks by utilizing test-time computation,\noutperforming algorithms without test-time adaptation mechanisms.",

In this\npaper, we propose the multi-view knowledge transfer learning (MVKTrans)\nframework, which transfers intra- and inter-omics knowledge in an adaptive\nmanner by reviewing data heterogeneity and suppressing bias transfer, thereby\nenhancing classification performance. Specifically, we design a graph\ncontrastive module that is trained on unlabeled data to effectively learn and\ntransfer the underlying intra-omics patterns to the supervised task. This\nunsupervised pretraining promotes learning general and unbiased representations\nfor each modality, regardless of the downstream tasks.

This module automatically identifies richer modalities and facilitates\ndynamic knowledge transfer from more informative to less informative omics,\nthereby enabling a more robust and generalized integration.

    "abstract": "Differential equations offer a foundational yet powerful framework for\nmodeling interactions within complex dynamic systems and are widely applied\nacross numerous scientific fields. One common challenge in this area is\nestimating the unknown parameters of these dynamic relationships. However,\ntraditional numerical optimization methods rely on the selection of initial\nparameter values, making them prone to local optima. Meanwhile, deep learning\nand Bayesian methods require training models on specific differential\nequations, resulting in poor versatility. This paper reformulates the parameter\nestimation problem of differential equations as an optimization problem by\nintroducing the concept of particles from the particle swarm optimization\nalgorithm. Building on reinforcement learning-based particle swarm optimization\n(RLLPSO), this paper proposes a novel method, DERLPSO, for estimating unknown\nparameters of differential equations. We compared its performance on three\ntypical ordinary differential equations with the state-of-the-art methods,\nincluding the RLLPSO algorithm, traditional numerical methods, deep learning\napproaches, and Bayesian methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nDERLPSO consistently outperforms other methods in terms of performance,\nachieving an average Mean Square Error of 1.13e-05, which reduces the error by\napproximately 4 orders of magnitude compared to other methods. Apart from\nordinary differential equations, our DERLPSO also show great promise for\nestimating unknown parameters of partial differential equations. The DERLPSO\nmethod proposed in this paper has high accuracy, is independent of initial\nparameter values, and possesses strong versatility and stability. This work\nprovides new insights into unknown parameter estimation for differential\nequations.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic Configuration Networks (SCNs) are a class of randomized neural\nnetworks that integrate randomized algorithms within an incremental learning\nframework. A defining feature of SCNs is the supervisory mechanism, which\nadaptively adjusts the distribution to generate effective random basis\nfunctions, thereby enabling error-free learning. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis of the impact of the supervisory mechanism on the\nlearning performance of SCNs. Our findings reveal that the current SCN\nframework evaluates the effectiveness of each random basis function in reducing\nresidual errors using a lower bound on its error reduction potential, which\nconstrains SCNs' overall learning efficiency. Specifically, SCNs may fail to\nconsistently select the most effective random candidate as the new basis\nfunction during each training iteration. To overcome this problem, we propose a\nnovel method for evaluating the hidden layer's output matrix, supported by a\nnew supervisory mechanism that accurately assesses the error reduction\npotential of random basis functions without requiring the computation of the\nMoore-Penrose inverse of the output matrix. This approach enhances the\nselection of basis functions, reducing computational complexity and improving\nthe overall scalability and learning capabilities of SCNs. We introduce a\nRecursive Moore-Penrose Inverse-SCN (RMPI-SCN) training scheme based on the new\nsupervisory mechanism and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations\nover some benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) are responsible for the drainage of waste\nproducts from the human brain. An impairment in their functionality has been\nassociated with aging as well as brain disorders like multiple sclerosis and\nAlzheimer's disease. However, MLVs have only recently been described for the\nfirst time in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their ramified structure\nrenders manual segmentation particularly difficult. Further, as there is no\nconsistent notion of their appearance, human-annotated MLV structures contain a\nhigh inter-rater variability that most automatic segmentation methods cannot\ntake into account. In this work, we propose a new rater-aware training scheme\nfor the popular nnU-Net model, and we explore rater-based ensembling strategies\nfor accurate and consistent segmentation of MLVs. This enables us to boost\nnnU-Net's performance while obtaining explicit predictions in different\nannotation styles and a rater-based uncertainty estimation. Our final model,\nMLV$^2$-Net, achieves a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.806 with respect to\nthe human reference standard. The model further matches the human inter-rater\nreliability and replicates age-related associations with MLV volume.",

    "abstract": "Tactile perception is essential for human interaction with the environment\nand is becoming increasingly crucial in robotics. Tactile sensors like the\nBioTac mimic human fingertips and provide detailed interaction data. Despite\nits utility in applications like slip detection and object identification, this\nsensor is now deprecated, making many valuable datasets obsolete. However,\nrecreating similar datasets with newer sensor technologies is both tedious and\ntime-consuming. Therefore, adapting these existing datasets for use with new\nsetups and modalities is crucial. In response, we introduce ACROSS, a novel\nframework for translating data between tactile sensors by exploiting sensor\ndeformation information. We demonstrate the approach by translating BioTac\nsignals into the DIGIT sensor. Our framework consists of first converting the\ninput signals into 3D deformation meshes. We then transition from the 3D\ndeformation mesh of one sensor to the mesh of another, and finally convert the\ngenerated 3D deformation mesh into the corresponding output space. We\ndemonstrate our approach to the most challenging problem of going from a\nlow-dimensional tactile representation to a high-dimensional one. In\nparticular, we transfer the tactile signals of a BioTac sensor to DIGIT tactile\nimages. Our approach enables the continued use of valuable datasets and data\nexchange between groups with different setups.",

By studying these attributes, we can discover\nlatent insights about the author and their underlying message. This article\nuses such an approach to better understand patent applications and their\ninventors. While prior research focuses on patent metadata, we employ machine\nlearning and natural language processing to extract hidden information from the\nwords in patent applications. Through these methods, we find that inventor\ngender can often be identified from textual attributes - even without knowing\nthe inventor's name. This ability to discern gender through text suggests that\nanonymized patent examination - often proposed as a solution to mitigate\ndisparities in patent grant rates - may not fully address gendered outcomes in\nsecuring a patent. Our study also investigates whether objective features of a\npatent application can predict if it will be granted. Using a classifier\nalgorithm, we correctly predicted whether a patent was granted over 60% of the\ntime. Further analysis emphasized that writing style - like vocabulary and\nsentence complexity - disproportionately influenced grant predictions relative\nto other attributes such as inventor gender and subject matter keywords.\nLastly, we examine whether women disproportionately invent in technological\nareas with higher rejection rates. Using a clustering algorithm, applications\nwere allocated into groups with related subject matter. We found that 85% of\nfemale-dominated clusters have abnormally high rejection rates, compared to\nonly 45% for male-dominated groupings. These findings highlight complex\ninteractions between textual choices, gender, and success in securing a patent.\nThey also raise questions about whether current proposals will be sufficient to\nachieve gender equity and efficiency in the patent system.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Depression is a severe mental disorder, and\naccurate diagnosis is pivotal to the cure and rehabilitation of people with\ndepression. However, the current questionnaire-based diagnostic methods could\nbring subjective biases and may be denied by subjects. In search of a more\nobjective means of diagnosis, researchers have begun to experiment with deep\nlearning-based methods for identifying depressive disorders in recent years.\nMethods: In this study, a novel Spatiotemporal-fused network with Automated\nmulti-scale Depth-wise and TIME-interval-related common feature extractor\n(SAD-TIME) is proposed. SAD-TIME incorporates an automated nodes' common\nfeatures extractor (CFE), a spatial sector (SpS), a modified temporal sector\n(TeS), and a domain adversarial learner (DAL). The CFE includes a multi-scale\ndepth-wise 1D-convolutional neural network and a time-interval embedding\ngenerator, where the unique information of each channel is preserved. The SpS\nfuses the functional connectivity with the distance-based connectivity\ncontaining spatial position of EEG electrodes. A multi-head-attention graph\nconvolutional network is also applied in the SpS to fuse the features from\ndifferent EEG channels. The TeS is based on long short-term memory and graph\ntransformer networks, where the temporal information of different time-windows\nis fused. Moreover, the DAL is used after the SpS to obtain the\ndomain-invariant feature. Results: Experimental results under tenfold\ncross-validation show that the proposed SAD-TIME method achieves 92.00% and\n94.00% depression classification accuracies on two datasets, respectively, in\ncross-subject mode. Conclusion: SAD-TIME is a robust depression detection\nmodel, where the automatedly-generated features, the SpS and the TeS assist the\nclassification performance with the fusion of the innate spatiotemporal\ninformation in the EEG signals.",

These\nmental representations are dynamic in nature and develop over time, thereby\nenabling explainers to react to explainees' needs by adapting and customizing\nthe explanation. XAI should be able to react to explainees' needs in a similar\nmanner. Therefore, a component that incorporates aspects of explainers' mental\nrepresentations of explainees is required. In this study, we took first steps\nby investigating explainers' mental representations in everyday explanations of\ntechnological artifacts. According to the dual nature theory, technological\nartifacts require explanations with two distinct perspectives, namely\nobservable and measurable features addressing \"Architecture\" or interpretable\naspects addressing \"Relevance\". We conducted extended semi structured pre-,\npost- and video recall-interviews with explainers (N=9) in the context of an\nexplanation. The transcribed interviews were analyzed utilizing qualitative\ncontent analysis. The explainers' answers regarding the explainees' knowledge\nand interests with regard to the technological artifact emphasized the\nvagueness of early assumptions of explainers toward strong beliefs in the\ncourse of explanations. The assumed knowledge of explainees in the beginning is\ncentered around Architecture and develops toward knowledge with regard to both\nArchitecture and Relevance. In contrast, explainers assumed higher interests in\nRelevance in the beginning to interests regarding both Architecture and\nRelevance in the further course of explanations. Further, explainers often\nfinished the explanation despite their perception that explainees still had\ngaps in knowledge. These findings are transferred into practical implications\nrelevant for user models for adaptive explainable systems.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable advances in deep learning have led to the emergence of many\noff-the-shelf classifiers, e.g., large pre-trained models. However, since they\nare typically trained on clean data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. Despite this vulnerability, their superior performance and\ntransferability make off-the-shelf classifiers still valuable in practice,\ndemanding further work to provide adversarial robustness for them in a post-hoc\nmanner. A recently proposed method, denoised smoothing, leverages a denoiser\nmodel in front of the classifier to obtain provable robustness without\nadditional training. However, the denoiser often creates hallucination, i.e.,\nimages that have lost the semantics of their originally assigned class, leading\nto a drop in robustness. Furthermore, its noise-and-denoise procedure\nintroduces a significant distribution shift from the original distribution,\ncausing the denoised smoothing framework to achieve sub-optimal robustness. In\nthis paper, we introduce Fine-Tuning with Confidence-Aware Denoised Image\nSelection (FT-CADIS), a novel fine-tuning scheme to enhance the certified\nrobustness of off-the-shelf classifiers. FT-CADIS is inspired by the\nobservation that the confidence of off-the-shelf classifiers can effectively\nidentify hallucinated images during denoised smoothing. Based on this, we\ndevelop a confidence-aware training objective to handle such hallucinated\nimages and improve the stability of fine-tuning from denoised images. In this\nway, the classifier can be fine-tuned using only images that are beneficial for\nadversarial robustness. We also find that such a fine-tuning can be done by\nupdating a small fraction of parameters of the classifier. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that FT-CADIS has established the state-of-the-art\ncertified robustness among denoised smoothing methods across all\n$\\ell_2$-adversary radius in various benchmarks.",

Comparative analyses in mini-grid environments\nwith the Clone-Structured Cognitive Graph model (CSCG), which shares similar\nobjectives, highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental\nstructures within a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap.

Secondly, we further\nintroduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances\nhomo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information\nand preventing feature confusion after pooling.

The wisdom\nof the crowd, i.e. the collective opinion of a group of individuals fails in\nsuch a scenario. However, the surprisingly popular (SP)\nalgorithm~\\cite{prelec2017solution} can recover the ground truth even when the\nexperts are in the minority, by asking the individuals to report additional\nprediction reports--their beliefs about the reports of others. Several recent\nworks have extended the surprisingly popular algorithm to an equivalent voting\nrule (SP-voting) to recover the ground truth ranking over a set of $m$\nalternatives. However, we are yet to fully understand when SP-voting can\nrecover the ground truth ranking, and if so, how many samples (votes and\npredictions) it needs. We answer this question by proposing two rank-order\nmodels and analyzing the sample complexity of SP-voting under these models. In\nparticular, we propose concentric mixtures of Mallows and Plackett-Luce models\nwith $G (\\ge 2)$ groups. Our models generalize previously proposed concentric\nmixtures of Mallows models with $2$ groups, and we highlight the importance of\n$G > 2$ groups by identifying three distinct groups (expert, intermediate, and\nnon-expert) from existing datasets. Next, we provide conditions on the\nparameters of the underlying models so that SP-voting can recover ground-truth\nrankings with high probability, and also derive sample complexities under the\nsame.

Emotions reflect an individual subjective experiences,\nwhile personality reveals relatively stable behavioral and cognitive patterns.\nExisting affective computing datasets often annotate emotion and personality\ntraits separately, lacking fine-grained labeling of micro-emotions and emotion\nintensity in both single-label and multi-label classifications. Chinese emotion\ndatasets are extremely scarce, and datasets capturing Chinese user personality\ntraits are even more limited. To address these gaps, this study collected data\nfrom the major social media platform Weibo, screening 11,338 valid users from\nover 50,000 individuals with diverse MBTI personality labels and acquiring\n566,900 posts along with the user MBTI personality tags. Using the EQN method,\nwe compiled a multi-label Chinese affective computing dataset that integrates\nthe same user's personality traits with six emotions and micro-emotions, each\nannotated with intensity levels. Validation results across multiple NLP\nclassification models demonstrate the dataset strong utility.

    "abstract": "Construction remains one of the most hazardous sectors. Recent advancements\nin AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising opportunities\nfor enhancing workplace safety. However, responsible integration of LLMs\nrequires systematic evaluation, as deploying them without understanding their\ncapabilities and limitations risks generating inaccurate information, fostering\nmisplaced confidence, and compromising worker safety. This study evaluates the\nperformance of two widely used LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, across three\nstandardized exams administered by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals\n(BCSP). Using 385 questions spanning seven safety knowledge areas, the study\nanalyzes the models' accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Results show that\nboth models consistently exceed the BCSP benchmark, with GPT-4o achieving an\naccuracy rate of 84.6% and GPT-3.5 reaching 73.8%. Both models demonstrate\nstrengths in safety management systems and hazard identification and control,\nbut exhibit weaknesses in science, mathematics, emergency response, and fire\nprevention. An error analysis identifies four primary limitations affecting LLM\nperformance: lack of knowledge, reasoning flaws, memory issues, and calculation\nerrors. Our study also highlights the impact of prompt engineering strategies,\nwith variations in accuracy reaching 13.5% for GPT-3.5 and 7.9% for GPT-4o.\nHowever, no single prompt configuration proves universally effective. This\nresearch advances knowledge in three ways: by identifying areas where LLMs can\nsupport safety practices and where human oversight remains essential, by\noffering practical insights into improving LLM implementation through prompt\nengineering, and by providing evidence-based direction for future research and\ndevelopment. These contributions support the responsible integration of AI in\nconstruction safety management toward achieving zero injuries.",

Recently,\nalignment-free methods, which represent protein structures as fixed-length\nreal-valued vectors, are proposed for PSSS. Although these methods have lower\ntime and memory cost than alignment-based methods, their time and memory cost\nis still too high for large-scale PSSS, and their accuracy is unsatisfactory.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method, called\n$\\underline{\\text{p}}$r$\\underline{\\text{o}}$tein\n$\\underline{\\text{s}}$tructure $\\underline{\\text{h}}$ashing (POSH), for PSSS.\nPOSH learns a binary vector representation for each protein structure, which\ncan dramatically reduce the time and memory cost for PSSS compared with\nreal-valued vector representation based methods.

Experimental results on real\ndatasets show that POSH can outperform other methods to achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, POSH achieves a memory saving of more\nthan six times and speed improvement of more than four times, compared with\nother methods.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have received considerable interest in wide\napplications lately. During pre-training via massive datasets, such a model\nimplicitly memorizes the factual knowledge of trained datasets in its hidden\nparameters. However, knowledge held implicitly in parameters often makes its\nuse by downstream applications ineffective due to the lack of common-sense\nreasoning. In this article, we introduce a general framework that permits to\nbuild knowledge bases with an aid of LLMs, tailored for processing Web news.\nThe framework applies a rule-based News Information Extractor (NewsIE) to news\nitems for extracting their relational tuples, referred to as knowledge bases,\nwhich are then graph-convoluted with the implicit knowledge facts of news items\nobtained by LLMs, for their classification. It involves two lightweight\ncomponents: 1) NewsIE: for extracting the structural information of every news\nitem, in the form of relational tuples; 2) BERTGraph: for graph convoluting the\nimplicit knowledge facts with relational tuples extracted by NewsIE. We have\nevaluated our framework under different news-related datasets for news category\nclassification, with promising experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Traditional decision tree algorithms are explainable but struggle with\nnon-linear, high-dimensional data, limiting its applicability in complex\ndecision-making. Neural networks excel at capturing complex patterns but\nsacrifice explainability in the process. In this work, we present GPTree, a\nnovel framework combining explainability of decision trees with the advanced\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs. GPTree eliminates the need for feature\nengineering and prompt chaining, requiring only a task-specific prompt and\nleveraging a tree-based structure to dynamically split samples. We also\nintroduce an expert-in-the-loop feedback mechanism to further enhance\nperformance by enabling human intervention to refine and rebuild decision\npaths, emphasizing the harmony between human expertise and machine\nintelligence. Our decision tree achieved a 7.8% precision rate for identifying\n\"unicorn\" startups at the inception stage of a startup, surpassing gpt-4o with\nfew-shot learning as well as the best human decision-makers (3.1% to 5.6%).",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in\nautomating software testing, specifically in generating unit test cases.\nHowever, the validation of LLM-generated test cases remains a challenge,\nparticularly when the ground truth is unavailable. This paper introduces\nVALTEST, a novel framework designed to automatically validate test cases\ngenerated by LLMs by leveraging token probabilities. We evaluate VALTEST using\nnine test suites generated from three datasets (HumanEval, MBPP, and LeetCode)\nacross three LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, and LLama3.1 8b). By extracting\nstatistical features from token probabilities, we train a machine learning\nmodel to predict test case validity. VALTEST increases the validity rate of\ntest cases by 6.2% to 24%, depending on the dataset and LLM. Our results\nsuggest that token probabilities are reliable indicators for distinguishing\nbetween valid and invalid test cases, which provides a robust solution for\nimproving the correctness of LLM-generated test cases in software testing. In\naddition, we found that replacing the identified invalid test cases by VALTEST,\nusing a Chain-of-Thought prompting results in a more effective test suite while\nkeeping the high validity rates.",

    "abstract": "Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important\ndiagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision-language modeling\nraise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size\nof whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally,\npathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions\nwhile also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it\ndifficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain\na largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most\nefforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the\npatch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the\nBLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports.\nThis enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such\nas text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as\nintegration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for\nWSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or\nAI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000\nWSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure\ntypes, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation\nand text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI\nclassification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging).\nModel-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without\nclinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work\ndemonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI\nembeddings.",

In this study, we examine this gap from three fundamental\nperspectives: appearance, motion, and geometry, comparing real-world videos\nwith those generated by a state-of-the-art AI model, Stable Video Diffusion. To\nachieve this, we train three classifiers using 3D convolutional networks, each\ntargeting distinct aspects: vision foundation model features for appearance,\noptical flow for motion, and monocular depth for geometry. Each classifier\nexhibits strong performance in fake video detection, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. This indicates that AI-generated videos are still easily\ndetectable, and a significant gap between real and fake videos persists.\nFurthermore, utilizing the Grad-CAM, we pinpoint systematic failures of\nAI-generated videos in appearance, motion, and geometry. Finally, we propose an\nEnsemble-of-Experts model that integrates appearance, optical flow, and depth\ninformation for fake video detection, resulting in enhanced robustness and\ngeneralization ability. Our model is capable of detecting videos generated by\nSora with high accuracy, even without exposure to any Sora videos during\ntraining. This suggests that the gap between real and fake videos can be\ngeneralized across various video generative models. Project page:\nhttps://justin-crchang.github.io/3DCNNDetection.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) decoding involves generating a sequence of tokens\nbased on a given context, where each token is predicted one at a time using the\nmodel's learned probabilities. The typical autoregressive decoding method\nrequires a separate forward pass through the model for each token generated,\nwhich is computationally inefficient and poses challenges for deploying LLMs in\nlatency-sensitive scenarios. The main limitations of current decoding methods\nstem from their inefficiencies and resource demands. Existing approaches either\nnecessitate fine-tuning smaller models, which is resource-intensive, or rely on\nfixed retrieval schemes to construct drafts for the next tokens, which lack\nadaptability and fail to generalize across different models and contexts. To\naddress these issues, we introduce a novel methodology called ADED, which\naccelerates LLM decoding without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach involves\nan adaptive draft-verification process that evolves over time to improve\nefficiency. We utilize a tri-gram matrix-based LLM representation to\ndynamically approximate the output distribution of the LLM, allowing the model\nto adjust to changing token probabilities during the decoding process.\nAdditionally, we implement a draft construction mechanism that effectively\nbalances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the drafts generated are\nboth diverse and close to the true output distribution of the LLM. The\nimportance of this design lies in its ability to optimize the draft\ndistribution adaptively, leading to faster and more accurate decoding. Through\nextensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and LLM architectures, we\ndemonstrate that ADED significantly accelerates the decoding process while\nmaintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in a wide range of\npractical applications.",

Through the lens of semi-realistic role-playing exercises designed to\nelicit such behaviors, we explore the response dynamics of LLMs post\nfine-tuning interventions. Our methodology involves prompting models for\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and analyzing the coherence between the\nreasoning traces and the resultant outputs.

Accordingly, the two key contributions\nof this paper are (1) defining and studying reason-based deception, a new type\nof hidden behavior, and (2) demonstrating that rebuttals provide a more robust\nresponse model to harmful requests than refusals, thereby highlighting the need\nto reconsider the response strategies in fine-tuning approaches.",

To address this gap, we introduce Meta\nLarge Language Model Compiler (LLM Compiler), a suite of robust, openly\navailable, pre-trained models specifically designed for code optimization\ntasks.

We also present\nfine-tuned versions of the model, demonstrating its enhanced capabilities in\noptimizing code size and disassembling from x86_64 and ARM assembly back into\nLLVM-IR.

    "abstract": "Despite the advances in large language models (LLMs), how they use their\nknowledge for reasoning is not yet well understood. In this study, we propose a\nmethod that deconstructs complex real-world questions into a graph,\nrepresenting each question as a node with predecessors of background knowledge\nneeded to solve the question. We develop the DepthQA dataset, deconstructing\nquestions into three depths: (i) recalling conceptual knowledge, (ii) applying\nprocedural knowledge, and (iii) analyzing strategic knowledge. Based on a\nhierarchical graph, we quantify forward discrepancy, a discrepancy in LLM\nperformance on simpler sub-problems versus complex questions. We also measure\nbackward discrepancy where LLMs answer complex questions but struggle with\nsimpler ones. Our analysis shows that smaller models exhibit more discrepancies\nthan larger models. Distinct patterns of discrepancies are observed across\nmodel capacity and possibility of training data memorization. Additionally,\nguiding models from simpler to complex questions through multi-turn\ninteractions improves performance across model sizes, highlighting the\nimportance of structured intermediate steps in knowledge reasoning. This work\nenhances our understanding of LLM reasoning and suggests ways to improve their\nproblem-solving abilities.",

While\nrendering such representations is indeed extremely efficient, storing and\ntransmitting them is often prohibitively expensive. To represent large-scale\nscenes, one often needs to store millions of 3D Gaussians, occupying gigabytes\nof disk space. This poses a very practical limitation, prohibiting widespread\nadoption.Several solutions have been proposed to strike a balance between disk\nsize and rendering quality, noticeably reducing the visual quality.

When compared to other compact solutions, ours\noffers higher quality renderings with significantly reduced storage, being able\nto efficiently run on a mobile device in real-time. Our key observation is that\nnearby points in the scene can share similar representations. Hence, only a\nsmall ratio of 3D points needs to be stored.

To address these questions, we propose analyzing a\nmodel's learning dynamics via a framework we call the concept space, where each\naxis represents an independent concept underlying the data generating process.\nBy characterizing learning dynamics in this space, we identify how the speed at\nwhich a concept is learned, and hence the order of concept learning, is\ncontrolled by properties of the data we term concept signal. Further, we\nobserve moments of sudden turns in the direction of a model's learning dynamics\nin concept space. Surprisingly, these points precisely correspond to the\nemergence of hidden capabilities, i.e., where latent interventions show the\nmodel possesses the capability to manipulate a concept, but these capabilities\ncannot yet be elicited via naive input prompting.

However, to realize the true potential of LLMs as autonomous\nagents, they must learn to identify, call, and interact with external tools and\napplication program interfaces (APIs) to complete complex tasks. These tasks\ntogether are termed function calling. Endowing LLMs with function calling\nabilities leads to a myriad of advantages, such as access to current and\ndomain-specific information in databases and knowledge sources, and the ability\nto outsource tasks that can be reliably performed by tools, e.g., a Python\ninterpreter or calculator. While there has been significant progress in\nfunction calling with LLMs, there is still a dearth of open models that perform\non par with proprietary LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Gemini. Therefore, in this\nwork, we introduce the GRANITE-20B-FUNCTIONCALLING model under an Apache 2.0\nlicense.

    "abstract": "The model editing problem concerns how language models should learn new facts\nabout the world over time. While empirical research on model editing has drawn\nwidespread attention, the conceptual foundations of model editing remain shaky\n-- perhaps unsurprisingly, since model editing is essentially belief revision,\na storied problem in philosophy that has eluded succinct solutions for decades.\nModel editing nonetheless demands a solution, since we need to be able to\ncontrol the knowledge within language models. With this goal in mind, this\npaper critiques the standard formulation of the model editing problem and\nproposes a formal testbed for model editing research. We first describe 12 open\nproblems with model editing, based on challenges with (1) defining the problem,\n(2) developing benchmarks, and (3) assuming LLMs have editable beliefs in the\nfirst place. Many of these challenges are extremely difficult to address, e.g.\ndetermining far-reaching consequences of edits, labeling probabilistic\nentailments between facts, and updating beliefs of agent simulators. Next, we\nintroduce a semi-synthetic dataset for model editing based on Wikidata, where\nwe can evaluate edits against labels given by an idealized Bayesian agent. This\nenables us to say exactly how belief revision in language models falls short of\na desirable epistemic standard. We encourage further research exploring\nsettings where such a gold standard can be compared against. Our code is\npublicly available at: https://github.com/peterbhase/LLM-belief-revision",

Over the past two\nyears, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio,\nunderscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However,\nprogress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian\ntexts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia,\nLGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and\nless understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for\nsubjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we\nintroduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity\nclassification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse\nindividuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in\nIndonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the\npresidential election.

    "abstract": "The task of multi-modal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to\nanalyze the genuine emotional state of each utterance based on the multi-modal\ninformation in the conversation, which is crucial for conversation\nunderstanding. Existing methods focus on using graph neural networks (GNN) to\nmodel conversational relationships and capture contextual latent semantic\nrelationships. However, due to the complexity of GNN, existing methods cannot\nefficiently capture the potential dependencies between long-distance\nutterances, which limits the performance of MERC. In this paper, we propose an\nEfficient Long-distance Latent Relation-aware Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN)\nfor multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations. Specifically, we first\nuse pre-extracted text, video and audio features as input to Bi-LSTM to capture\ncontextual semantic information and obtain low-level utterance features. Then,\nwe use low-level utterance features to construct a conversational emotion\ninteraction graph. To efficiently capture the potential dependencies between\nlong-distance utterances, we use the dilated generalized forward push algorithm\nto precompute the emotional propagation between global utterances and design an\nemotional relation-aware operator to capture the potential semantic\nassociations between different utterances. Furthermore, we combine early fusion\nand adaptive late fusion mechanisms to fuse latent dependency information\nbetween speaker relationship information and context. Finally, we obtain\nhigh-level discourse features and feed them into MLP for emotion prediction.\nExtensive experimental results show that ELR-GNN achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the benchmark datasets IEMOCAP and MELD, with running times\nreduced by 52\\% and 35\\%, respectively.",

Enabling automatic updation of AI knowledge using web data\ninvolves significant concerns regarding the model's safety and quality due to a\nthreat from unsafe and undesirable text across the web. The purity of new data\nwas essential for updating knowledge of language models to maintain their\nreliability. This paper proposes AutoPureData, a system that automatically\ncollects and purifies web data. The system loaded a sample of web data.\nUtilizing existing trusted AI models, it successfully eliminated unsafe text\nwith an accuracy of 97% and undesirable text with an accuracy of 86%,\ndemonstrating the system's effectiveness in purifying the data. The system\nensures that only meaningful and safe text can be used to update LLM knowledge.\nThe pure text was then optimized and stored in a vector database for future\nquerying. It was found that LLM can fetch new data from the vector DB. The LLM\nwrites the RAG query in English, even if the user's query is in another\nlanguage, proving that the system can perform cross-lingual retrieval.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models have transformed ML/AI\ndevelopment, necessitating a reevaluation of AutoML principles for the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. To address the challenges of\nhyper-parameter optimization and online adaptation in RAG, we propose the\nAutoRAG-HP framework, which formulates the hyper-parameter tuning as an online\nmulti-armed bandit (MAB) problem and introduces a novel two-level Hierarchical\nMAB (Hier-MAB) method for efficient exploration of large search spaces. We\nconduct extensive experiments on tuning hyper-parameters, such as top-k\nretrieved documents, prompt compression ratio, and embedding methods, using the\nALCE-ASQA and Natural Questions datasets. Our evaluation from jointly\noptimization all three hyper-parameters demonstrate that MAB-based online\nlearning methods can achieve Recall@5 $\\approx 0.8$ for scenarios with\nprominent gradients in search space, using only $\\sim20\\%$ of the LLM API calls\nrequired by the Grid Search approach. Additionally, the proposed Hier-MAB\napproach outperforms other baselines in more challenging optimization\nscenarios. The code will be made available at https://aka.ms/autorag.",

    "abstract": "Speaker diarization is usually referred to as the task that determines ``who\nspoke when'' in a recording. Until a few years ago, all competitive approaches\nwere modular. Systems based on this framework reached state-of-the-art\nperformance in most scenarios but had major difficulties dealing with\noverlapped speech. More recently, the advent of end-to-end models, capable of\ndealing with all aspects of speaker diarization with a single model and better\nperforming regarding overlapped speech, has brought high levels of attention.\n  This thesis is framed during a period of co-existence of these two trends. We\ndescribe a system based on a Bayesian hidden Markov model used to cluster\nx-vectors (speaker embeddings obtained with a neural network), known as VBx,\nwhich has shown remarkable performance on different datasets and challenges. We\ncomment on its advantages and limitations and evaluate results on different\nrelevant corpora. Then, we move towards end-to-end neural diarization (EEND)\nmethods. Due to the need for large training sets for training these models and\nthe lack of manually annotated diarization data in sufficient quantities, the\ncompromise solution consists in generating training data artificially. We\ndescribe an approach for generating synthetic data which resembles real\nconversations in terms of speaker turns and overlaps. We show how this method\ngenerating ``simulated conversations'' allows for better performance than using\na previously proposed method for creating ``simulated mixtures'' when training\nthe popular EEND with encoder-decoder attractors (EEND-EDA). We also propose a\nnew EEND-based model, which we call DiaPer, and show that it can perform better\nthan EEND-EDA, especially when dealing with many speakers and handling\noverlapped speech. Finally, we compare both VBx-based and DiaPer systems on a\nwide variety of corpora and comment on the advantages of each technique.",

Unlike previous narrowly focused\nreviews, our study encompasses a broad array of medical data modalities and\nexplores various generative models. Our search strategy queries databases such\nas Scopus, PubMed, and ArXiv, focusing on recent works from January 2021 to\nNovember 2023, excluding reviews and perspectives. This period emphasizes\nrecent advancements beyond GANs, which have been extensively covered\npreviously.\n  The survey reveals insights from three key aspects: (1) Synthesis\napplications and purpose of synthesis, (2) generation techniques, and (3)\nevaluation methods. It highlights clinically valid synthesis applications,\ndemonstrating the potential of synthetic data to tackle diverse clinical\nrequirements. While conditional models incorporating class labels, segmentation\nmasks and image translations are prevalent, there is a gap in utilizing prior\nclinical knowledge and patient-specific context, suggesting a need for more\npersonalized synthesis approaches and emphasizing the importance of tailoring\ngenerative approaches to the unique characteristics of medical data.\nAdditionally, there is a significant gap in using synthetic data beyond\naugmentation, such as for validation and evaluation of downstream medical AI\nmodels. The survey uncovers that the lack of standardized evaluation\nmethodologies tailored to medical images is a barrier to clinical application,\nunderscoring the need for in-depth evaluation approaches, benchmarking, and\ncomparative studies to promote openness and collaboration.",

Existing methods dynamically adjust the temperature to enable\nthe student network to adapt to the varying learning difficulties at different\nlearning stages of KD.

To address this issue, we formulate the adjustment of\ntemperature as a sequential decision-making task and propose a method based on\nreinforcement learning, termed RLKD.

Compared to prior\nworks that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the\ncontrol command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both\nstrong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified\ntokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a\nself-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized\ntokens for behavior trajectories $\\tau = \\{o_0, a_0, \\dots\\}$ and an imitation\nlearning policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior\ntokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language\nModels. With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions\ninvolving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual\nresponses, behavior trajectories, etc into unified token sequences and model\nthem with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful\nbehavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing\nchain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior\ntokens for the imitation learning policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates\nexcellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic,\nand open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the\ncrucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization,\nand its scaling potentials.

    "abstract": "Personalized Federated Continual Learning (PFCL) is a new practical scenario\nthat poses greater challenges in sharing and personalizing knowledge. PFCL not\nonly relies on knowledge fusion for server aggregation at the global\nspatial-temporal perspective but also needs model improvement for each client\naccording to the local requirements. Existing methods, whether in Personalized\nFederated Learning (PFL) or Federated Continual Learning (FCL), have overlooked\nthe multi-granularity representation of knowledge, which can be utilized to\novercome Spatial-Temporal Catastrophic Forgetting (STCF) and adopt generalized\nknowledge to itself by coarse-to-fine human cognitive mechanisms. Moreover, it\nallows more effectively to personalized shared knowledge, thus serving its own\npurpose. To this end, we propose a novel concept called multi-granularity\nprompt, i.e., coarse-grained global prompt acquired through the common model\nlearning process, and fine-grained local prompt used to personalize the\ngeneralized representation. The former focuses on efficiently transferring\nshared global knowledge without spatial forgetting, and the latter emphasizes\nspecific learning of personalized local knowledge to overcome temporal\nforgetting. In addition, we design a selective prompt fusion mechanism for\naggregating knowledge of global prompts distilled from different clients. By\nthe exclusive fusion of coarse-grained knowledge, we achieve the transmission\nand refinement of common knowledge among clients, further enhancing the\nperformance of personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in addressing STCF as well as improving\npersonalized performance.

This undesired learning of naive shortcuts\n(Clever Hans effect) can happen for example in echocardiogram view\nclassification when background cues (e.g. metadata) are biased towards a class\nand the model learns to focus on those background features instead of on the\nimage content. We propose a simple, yet effective random background\naugmentation method called BackMix, which samples random backgrounds from other\nexamples in the training set. By enforcing the background to be uncorrelated\nwith the outcome, the model learns to focus on the data within the ultrasound\nsector and becomes invariant to the regions outside this. We extend our method\nin a semi-supervised setting, finding that the positive effects of BackMix are\nmaintained with as few as 5% of segmentation labels. A loss weighting\nmechanism, wBackMix, is also proposed to increase the contribution of the\naugmented examples.

One common\nfeature of most substrates where life emerges is a marked shift in dynamics\nwhen self-replication appears. While there are some hypotheses regarding how\nself-replicators arose in nature, we know very little about the general\ndynamics, computational principles, and necessary conditions for\nself-replicators to emerge. This is especially true on \"computational\nsubstrates\" where interactions involve logical, mathematical, or programming\nrules. In this paper we take a step towards understanding how self-replicators\narise by studying several computational substrates based on various simple\nprogramming languages and machine instruction sets. We show that when random,\nnon self-replicating programs are placed in an environment lacking any explicit\nfitness landscape, self-replicators tend to arise. We demonstrate how this\noccurs due to random interactions and self-modification, and can happen with\nand without background random mutations. We also show how increasingly complex\ndynamics continue to emerge following the rise of self-replicators. Finally, we\nshow a counterexample of a minimalistic programming language where\nself-replicators are possible, but so far have not been observed to arise.",

Much previous work comparing\nrepresentations in humans and AI has relied on global, scalar measures to\nquantify their alignment. However, without explicit hypotheses, these measures\nonly inform us about the degree of alignment, not the factors that determine\nit. To address this challenge, we propose a generic framework to compare human\nand AI representations, based on identifying latent representational dimensions\nunderlying the same behavior in both domains. Applying this framework to humans\nand a deep neural network (DNN) model of natural images revealed a\nlow-dimensional DNN embedding of both visual and semantic dimensions. In\ncontrast to humans, DNNs exhibited a clear dominance of visual over semantic\nproperties, indicating divergent strategies for representing images. While\nin-silico experiments showed seemingly consistent interpretability of DNN\ndimensions, a direct comparison between human and DNN representations revealed\nsubstantial differences in how they process images. By making representations\ndirectly comparable, our results reveal important challenges for\nrepresentational alignment and offer a means for improving their comparability.",

    "abstract": "Exact unlearning was first introduced as a privacy mechanism that allowed a\nuser to retract their data from machine learning models on request. Shortly\nafter, inexact schemes were proposed to mitigate the impractical costs\nassociated with exact unlearning. More recently unlearning is often discussed\nas an approach for removal of impermissible knowledge i.e. knowledge that the\nmodel should not possess such as unlicensed copyrighted, inaccurate, or\nmalicious information. The promise is that if the model does not have a certain\nmalicious capability, then it cannot be used for the associated malicious\npurpose. In this paper we revisit the paradigm in which unlearning is used for\nin Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlight an underlying inconsistency\narising from in-context learning. Unlearning can be an effective control\nmechanism for the training phase, yet it does not prevent the model from\nperforming an impermissible act during inference. We introduce a concept of\nununlearning, where unlearned knowledge gets reintroduced in-context,\neffectively rendering the model capable of behaving as if it knows the\nforgotten knowledge. As a result, we argue that content filtering for\nimpermissible knowledge will be required and even exact unlearning schemes are\nnot enough for effective content regulation. We discuss feasibility of\nununlearning for modern LLMs and examine broader implications.",

    "abstract": "Grounding DINO and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive\nperformance in zero-shot object detection and image segmentation, respectively.\nTogether, they have a great potential to revolutionize applications in\nzero-shot semantic segmentation or data annotation. Yet, in specialized domains\nlike medical image segmentation, objects of interest (e.g., organs, tissues,\nand tumors) may not fall in existing class names. To address this problem, the\nreferring expression comprehension (REC) ability of Grounding DINO is leveraged\nto detect arbitrary targets by their language descriptions. However, recent\nstudies have highlighted severe limitation of the REC framework in this\napplication setting owing to its tendency to make false positive predictions\nwhen the target is absent in the given image. And, while this bottleneck is\ncentral to the prospect of open-set semantic segmentation, it is still largely\nunknown how much improvement can be achieved by studying the prediction errors.\nTo this end, we perform empirical studies on six publicly available datasets\nacross different domains and reveal that these errors consistently follow a\npredictable pattern and can, thus, be mitigated by a simple strategy.\nSpecifically, we show that false positive detections with appreciable\nconfidence scores generally occupy large image areas and can usually be\nfiltered by their relative sizes. More importantly, we expect these\nobservations to inspire future research in improving REC-based detection and\nautomated segmentation.

In this study, we\nexplored the environmental correlates of these disorders by analyzing\nstreet-view images (SVI) of neighborhoods in the Netherlands. Our dataset\ncomprises 9,879 Dutch SVIs sourced from Google Street View, paired with\nstatistical depression and anxiety risk metrics from the Dutch Health Monitor.\nTo tackle this challenge, we refined two existing neural network architectures,\nDeiT Base and ResNet50. Our goal was to predict neighborhood risk levels,\ncategorized into four tiers from low to high risk, using the raw images. The\nresults showed that DeiT Base and ResNet50 achieved accuracies of 43.43% and\n43.63%, respectively. Notably, a significant portion of the errors were between\nadjacent risk categories, resulting in adjusted accuracies of 83.55% and\n80.38%. We also implemented the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method on\nboth models and employed gradient rollout on DeiT. Interestingly, while SHAP\nunderscored specific landscape attributes, the correlation between these\nfeatures and distinct depression risk categories remained unclear. The gradient\nrollout findings were similarly non-definitive. However, through manual\nanalysis, we identified certain landscape types that were consistently linked\nwith specific risk categories. These findings suggest the potential of these\ntechniques in monitoring the correlation between various landscapes and\nenvironmental risk factors for mental health issues.

However, FL\nsystems often involve resource-constrained client devices with limited\ncomputational power, memory, storage, and bandwidth. This paper introduces\nFedMap, a novel method that aims to enhance the communication efficiency of FL\ndeployments by collaboratively learning an increasingly sparse global model\nthrough iterative, unstructured pruning. Importantly, FedMap trains a global\nmodel from scratch, unlike other methods reported in the literature, making it\nideal for privacy-critical use cases such as in the medical and finance\ndomains, where suitable pre-training data is often limited. FedMap adapts\niterative magnitude-based pruning to the FL setting, ensuring all clients prune\nand refine the same subset of the global model parameters, therefore gradually\nreducing the global model size and communication overhead. The iterative nature\nof FedMap, forming subsequent models as subsets of predecessors, avoids\nparameter reactivation issues seen in prior work, resulting in stable\nperformance. In this paper we provide an extensive evaluation of FedMap across\ndiverse settings, datasets, model architectures, and hyperparameters, assessing\nperformance in both IID and non-IID environments. Comparative analysis against\nthe baseline approach demonstrates FedMap's ability to achieve more stable\nclient model performance. For IID scenarios, FedMap achieves over $90$\\%\npruning without significant performance degradation. In non-IID settings, it\nachieves at least $~80$\\% pruning while maintaining accuracy.

    "abstract": "3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in\nautonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal\ninputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these\ntwo modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct\nfusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features\nstruggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D\nspatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial\nawareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this\nletter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion\nframework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and\nspatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera\nfeatures in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness\nof the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features\nfrom both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and\nspatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion\nconsisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic\nawareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement\nModule (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D\nvoxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse\nthe enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against\nthe prior arts.

However, the training of current CBMs is heavily dependent on the\nprecision and richness of the annotated concepts in the dataset. These concept\nlabels are typically provided by experts, which can be costly and require\nsignificant resources and effort. Additionally, concept saliency maps\nfrequently misalign with input saliency maps, causing concept predictions to\ncorrespond to irrelevant input features - an issue related to annotation\nalignment. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called\nSSCBM (Semi-supervised Concept Bottleneck Model). Our SSCBM is suitable for\npractical situations where annotated data is scarce. By leveraging joint\ntraining on both labeled and unlabeled data and aligning the unlabeled data at\nthe concept level, we effectively solve these issues. We proposed a strategy to\ngenerate pseudo labels and an alignment loss. Experiments demonstrate that our\nSSCBM is both effective and efficient. With only 10% labeled data, our model's\nconcept and task accuracy on average across four datasets is only 2.44% and\n3.93% lower, respectively, compared to the best baseline in the fully\nsupervised learning setting.",

The interpretability is provided in two ways: on the one\nhand, the main BCC dermoscopic patterns are found in the image to justify the\nBCC/Non BCC classification. Secondly, based on the common visual XAI Grad-CAM,\na clinically inspired visual explanation is developed where the relevant\nfeatures for diagnosis are located. Since there is no established ground truth\nfor BCC dermoscopic features, a standard reference is inferred from the\ndiagnosis of four dermatologists using an Expectation Maximization (EM) based\nalgorithm.

The BCC/non-BCC\nclassification achieved an accuracy rate of 90%. For Clinically-inspired XAI\nresults, the detection of BCC patterns useful to clinicians reaches 99%\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting\npretrained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using\nminimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial\nperturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted\ndatasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective\nperturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification\nmethods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting\nin information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the\nfine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We\nhypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a\nlatent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP\nembedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate\nnoisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor\ngeneralization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense\nframework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning.\nWe first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images\nwith their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce\ncontrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of\npersonalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers\nfundamental shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our\nextensive evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing purification\nmethods and stronger robustness against adaptive perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Federated graph learning collaboratively learns a global graph neural network\nwith distributed graphs, where the non-independent and identically distributed\nproperty is one of the major challenges. Most relative arts focus on\ntraditional distributed tasks like images and voices, incapable of graph\nstructures. This paper firstly reveals that local client distortion is brought\nby both node-level semantics and graph-level structure. First, for node-level\nsemantics, we find that contrasting nodes from distinct classes is beneficial\nto provide a well-performing discrimination. We pull the local node towards the\nglobal node of the same class and push it away from the global node of\ndifferent classes. Second, we postulate that a well-structural graph neural\nnetwork possesses similarity for neighbors due to the inherent adjacency\nrelationships. However, aligning each node with adjacent nodes hinders\ndiscrimination due to the potential class inconsistency. We transform the\nadjacency relationships into the similarity distribution and leverage the\nglobal model to distill the relation knowledge into the local model, which\npreserves the structural information and discriminability of the local model.\nEmpirical results on three graph datasets manifest the superiority of the\nproposed method over its counterparts.",

A typical task-oriented conversational system can be\nbroken down into three phases: external API selection, argument filling, and\nresponse generation. The focus of our work is the task of argument filling,\nwhich is in charge of accurately providing arguments required by the selected\nAPI. Upon comprehending the dialogue history and the pre-defined API schema,\nthe argument filling task is expected to provide the external API with the\nnecessary information to generate a desirable agent action. In this paper, we\nstudy the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the problem of API\nargument filling task. Our initial investigation reveals that LLMs require an\nadditional grounding process to successfully perform argument filling,\ninspiring us to design training and prompting frameworks to ground their\nresponses. Our experimental results demonstrate that when paired with proposed\ntechniques, the argument filling performance of LLMs noticeably improves,\npaving a new way toward building an automated argument filling framework.",

However, most\ncommunication tools are developed for spoken and written languages which can\ncause problems and difficulties for the deaf and hard of hearing community. By\ndeveloping a sign language recognition system, we can bridge this communication\ngap and enable people who use sign language as their main form of expression to\nbetter communicate with people and their surroundings. This recognition system\nincreases the quality of health services, improves public services, and creates\nequal opportunities for the deaf community. This research aims to recognize\nIranian Sign Language words with the help of the latest deep learning tools\nsuch as transformers. The dataset used includes 101 Iranian Sign Language words\nfrequently used in academic environments such as universities. The network used\nis a combination of early fusion and late fusion transformer encoder-based\nnetworks optimized with the help of genetic algorithm. The selected features to\ntrain this network include hands and lips key points, and the distance and\nangle between hands extracted from the sign videos. Also, in addition to the\ntraining model for the classes, the embedding vectors of words are used as\nmulti-task learning to have smoother and more efficient training. This model\nwas also tested on sentences generated from our word dataset using a windowing\ntechnique for sentence translation. Finally, the sign language training\nsoftware that provides real-time feedback to users with the help of the\ndeveloped model, which has 90.2% accuracy on test data, was introduced, and in\na survey, the effectiveness and efficiency of this type of sign language\nlearning software and the impact of feedback were investigated.",

When a multi-objective control problem is continuous and\ncomplex, traditional multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms\nsearch for many Pareto-optimal deep policies to approximate the Pareto set,\nwhich is quite resource-consuming. In this paper, we propose a simple and\nresource-efficient MORL algorithm that learns a continuous representation of\nthe Pareto set in a high-dimensional policy parameter space using a single\nhypernet. The learned hypernet can directly generate various well-trained\npolicy networks for different user preferences. We compare our method with two\nstate-of-the-art MORL algorithms on seven multi-objective continuous robot\ncontrol problems. Experimental results show that our method achieves the best\noverall performance with the least training parameters. An interesting\nobservation is that the Pareto set is well approximated by a curved line or\nsurface in a high-dimensional parameter space. This observation will provide\ninsight for researchers to design new MORL algorithms.",

The main solutions include\nquestion to formal query parsing and retrieval-based answer generation.\nHowever, current methods of the former often suffer from weak generalization,\nfailing to dealing with multi-types of sources, while the later is limited in\ntrustfulness. In this paper, we propose TrustUQA, a trustful QA framework that\ncan simultaneously support multiple types of structured data in a unified way.\nTo this end, it adopts an LLM-friendly and unified knowledge representation\nmethod called Condition Graph(CG), and uses an LLM and demonstration-based\ntwo-level method for CG querying. For enhancement, it is also equipped with\ndynamic demonstration retrieval. We have evaluated TrustUQA with 5 benchmarks\ncovering 3 types of structured data. It outperforms 2 existing unified\nstructured data QA methods. In comparison with the baselines that are specific\nto one data type, it achieves state-of-the-art on 2 of the datasets. Further\nmore, we have demonstrated the potential of our method for more general QA\ntasks, QA over mixed structured data and QA across structured data.

    "abstract": "Group decision-making (GDM) characterized by complexity and uncertainty is an\nessential part of various life scenarios. Most existing researches lack tools\nto fuse information quickly and interpret decision results for partially formed\ndecisions. This limitation is particularly noticeable when there is a need to\nimprove the efficiency of GDM. To address this issue, a novel multi-level\nsequential three-way decision for group decision-making (S3W-GDM) method is\nconstructed from the perspective of granular computing. This method\nsimultaneously considers the vagueness, hesitation, and variation of GDM\nproblems under double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (DHHFLTS)\nenvironment. First, for fusing information efficiently, a novel multi-level\nexpert information fusion method is proposed, and the concepts of expert\ndecision table and the extraction/aggregation of decision-leveled information\nbased on the multi-level granularity are defined. Second, the neighborhood\ntheory, outranking relation and regret theory (RT) are utilized to redesign the\ncalculations of conditional probability and relative loss function. Then, the\ngranular structure of DHHFLTS based on the sequential three-way decision (S3WD)\nis defined to improve the decision-making efficiency, and the decision-making\nstrategy and interpretation of each decision-level are proposed. Furthermore,\nthe algorithm of S3W-GDM is given. Finally, an illustrative example of\ndiagnosis is presented, and the comparative and sensitivity analysis with other\nmethods are performed to verify the efficiency and rationality of the proposed\nmethod.",

We formulate prompt engineering\nas a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major\nchallenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1)\nEnormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses\nsignificant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient:\nEfficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires\nbackpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a\nnon-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our\nmain technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we\ndesign a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only\nthe most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain\nspace. Second, we introduce \"Shortcut Text Gradient\" -- an effective\nreplacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and\nruntime.

However, persona\nprofiles, a prevalent setting in current personalized dialogue datasets,\ntypically composed of merely four to five sentences, may not offer\ncomprehensive descriptions of the persona about the agent, posing a challenge\nto generate truly personalized dialogues. To handle this problem, we propose\n$\\textbf{L}$earning Retrieval $\\textbf{A}$ugmentation for\n$\\textbf{P}$ersonalized $\\textbf{D}$ial$\\textbf{O}$gue $\\textbf{G}$eneration\n($\\textbf{LAPDOG}$), which studies the potential of leveraging external\nknowledge for persona dialogue generation.

The story\nretriever uses a given persona profile as queries to retrieve relevant\ninformation from the story document, which serves as a supplementary context to\naugment the persona profile. The dialogue generator utilizes both the dialogue\nhistory and the augmented persona profile to generate personalized responses.\nFor optimization, we adopt a joint training framework that collaboratively\nlearns the story retriever and dialogue generator, where the story retriever is\noptimized towards desired ultimate metrics (e.g., BLEU) to retrieve content for\nthe dialogue generator to generate personalized responses. Experiments\nconducted on the CONVAI2 dataset with ROCStory as a supplementary data source\nshow that the proposed LAPDOG method substantially outperforms the baselines,\nindicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Existing event stream-based pattern recognition models usually represent the\nevent stream as the point cloud, voxel, image, etc., and design various deep\nneural networks to learn their features. Although considerable results can be\nachieved in simple cases, however, the model performance may be limited by\nmonotonous modality expressions, sub-optimal fusion, and readout mechanisms. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel dual-stream framework for event stream-based\npattern recognition via differentiated fusion, termed EFV++. It models two\ncommon event representations simultaneously, i.e., event images and event\nvoxels. The spatial and three-dimensional stereo information can be learned\nseparately by utilizing Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN). We believe\nthe features of each representation still contain both efficient and redundant\nfeatures and a sub-optimal solution may be obtained if we directly fuse them\nwithout differentiation. Thus, we divide each feature into three levels and\nretain high-quality features, blend medium-quality features, and exchange\nlow-quality features. The enhanced dual features will be fed into the fusion\nTransformer together with bottleneck features. In addition, we introduce a\nnovel hybrid interaction readout mechanism to enhance the diversity of features\nas final representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used event\nstream-based classification datasets. Specifically, we achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Bullying10k dataset, i.e., $90.51\\%$, which\nexceeds the second place by $+2.21\\%$.

However, obstacles such as buildings, trees, and\nother vehicles can cause signal attenuation and blockage, leading to\ncommunication failures that can result in fatal accidents or traffic\ncongestion. Predicting blockages is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient\ncommunications. Furthermore, the advent of 6G technology is anticipated to\nintegrate advanced sensing capabilities, utilizing a variety of sensor types.\nThese sensors, ranging from traditional RF sensors to cameras and Lidar\nsensors, are expected to provide access to rich multimodal data, thereby\nenriching communication systems with a wealth of additional contextual\ninformation.

Our method\ncapitalizes on the synergistic strengths of CNNs and ViTs to extract features\nfrom time-series multimodal data, which include images and beam vectors.

Exfiltration and data\nleakage of ML models are discussed in addition to the potential extraction of\nmodels derived from first-principles (e.g., physics-based). We also discuss\ndesign considerations with DT-integrated robotics touching on the impact of ML\nmodel training, responsible AI and DT safeguards, data governance and ethical\nconsiderations on the effectiveness of these attacks. We advocate for a trusted\nautonomy approach, emphasizing the need to combine robotics, AI, and DT\ntechnologies with robust ethical frameworks and trustworthiness principles for\nsecure and reliable AI robotic systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the question of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) like\nChatGPT possess minds, focusing specifically on whether they have a genuine\nfolk psychology encompassing beliefs, desires, and intentions. We approach this\nquestion by investigating two key aspects: internal representations and\ndispositions to act. First, we survey various philosophical theories of\nrepresentation, including informational, causal, structural, and teleosemantic\naccounts, arguing that LLMs satisfy key conditions proposed by each. We draw on\nrecent interpretability research in machine learning to support these claims.\nSecond, we explore whether LLMs exhibit robust dispositions to perform actions,\na necessary component of folk psychology. We consider two prominent\nphilosophical traditions, interpretationism and representationalism, to assess\nLLM action dispositions. While we find evidence suggesting LLMs may satisfy\nsome criteria for having a mind, particularly in game-theoretic environments,\nwe conclude that the data remains inconclusive. Additionally, we reply to\nseveral skeptical challenges to LLM folk psychology, including issues of\nsensory grounding, the \"stochastic parrots\" argument, and concerns about\nmemorization. Our paper has three main upshots. First, LLMs do have robust\ninternal representations. Second, there is an open question to answer about\nwhether LLMs have robust action dispositions. Third, existing skeptical\nchallenges to LLM representation do not survive philosophical scrutiny.",

    "abstract": "Random features are a powerful technique for rewriting positive-definite\nkernels as linear products. They bring linear tools to bear in important\nnonlinear domains like KNNs and attention. Unfortunately, practical\nimplementations require approximating an expectation, usually via sampling.\nThis has led to the development of increasingly elaborate representations with\never lower sample error. We resolve this arms race by deriving an optimal\nsampling policy. Under this policy all random features representations have the\nsame approximation error, which we show is the lowest possible. This means that\nwe are free to choose whatever representation we please, provided we sample\noptimally.",

    "authors": [

    "abstract": "Common infinite-width architectures such as Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs)\nhave historically shown weak performance compared to finite models. This is\nusually attributed to the absence of feature learning. We show that this\nexplanation is insufficient. Specifically, we show that infinite width NTKs\nobviate the need for feature learning. They can learn identical behavior by\nselecting relevant subfeatures from their (infinite) frozen feature vector.\nFurthermore, we show experimentally that NTKs under-perform traditional finite\nmodels even when feature learning is artificially disabled. Instead, we show\nthat weak performance is at least partly due to the fact that existing\nconstructions depend on weak optimizers like SGD. We provide a new infinite\nwidth limit based on ADAM-like learning dynamics and demonstrate empirically\nthat the resulting models erase this performance gap.",

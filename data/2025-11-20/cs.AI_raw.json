    "abstract": "Background: Mentalization integrates cognitive, affective, and intersubjective components. Large Language Models (LLMs) display an increasing ability to generate reflective texts, raising questions regarding the relationship between linguistic form and mental representation. This study assesses the extent to which a single LLM can reproduce the linguistic structure of mentalization according to the parameters of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT).\n  Methods: Fifty dialogues were generated between human participants and an LLM configured in standard mode. Five psychiatrists trained in MBT, working under blinded conditions, evaluated the mentalization profiles produced by the model along the four MBT axes, assigning Likert-scale scores for evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and global quality. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using ICC(3,1).\n  Results: Mean scores (3.63-3.98) and moderate standard deviations indicate a high level of structural coherence in the generated profiles. ICC values (0.60-0.84) show substantial-to-high agreement among raters. The model proved more stable in the Implicit-Explicit and Self-Other dimensions, while presenting limitations in the integration of internal states and external contexts. The profiles were coherent and clinically interpretable yet characterized by affective neutrality.",

    "abstract": "The integration of advanced technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), into manufacturing processes is attracting significant attention, paving the way for the development of intelligent systems that enhance efficiency and automation. This paper uses the term \"Gentelligent system\" to refer to systems that incorporate inherent component information (akin to genes in bioinformatics-where manufacturing operations are likened to chromosomes in this study) and automated mechanisms. By implementing reliable fault detection methods, manufacturers can achieve several benefits, including improved product quality, increased yield, and reduced production costs. To support these objectives, we propose a hybrid framework with a dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This mechanism enables simultaneous optimization of feature selection and classification performance by exploring Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run. This solution helps monitor various manufacturing operations, addressing a range of conflicting objectives that need to be minimized together. Manufacturers can leverage such predictive methods and better adapt to emerging trends. To strengthen the validation of our model, we incorporate two real-world datasets from different industrial domains. The results on both datasets demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that, in addition to directly impairing functional mobility, is frequently associated with vocal impairments such as hypophonia and dysarthria, which typically manifest in the early stages. The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.",

This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).\n  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.\n  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds. This research offers a promising non-invasive PAM approach for lobster conservation, detection, and management in aquaculture and fisheries, enabling real-world edge computing applications for underwater species.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.",

Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.",

    "abstract": "How to enable human-like long-term memory in large language models (LLMs) has been a central question for unlocking more general capabilities such as few-shot generalization. Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best). We demonstrate that a simple search method applied to raw data outperforms goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms in current long-context memory tasks, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable.

However, the literature still lacks a methodology that fully leverages these longitudinal big data to accurately predict feed intake accounting for environmental conditions. To fill this gap, we developed an AI-based framework to accurately predict feed intake of individual animals and pen-level aggregation. Data from 19 experiments (>16.5M samples; 2013-2024) conducted at Nancy M. Cummings Research Extension & Education Center (Carmen, ID) feedlot facility and environmental data from AgriMet Network weather stations were used to develop two novel environmental indices: InComfort-Index, based solely on meteorological variables, showed good predictive capability for thermal comfort but had limited ability to predict feed intake; EASI-Index, a hybrid index integrating environmental variables with feed intake behavior, performed well in predicting feed intake but was less effective for thermal comfort. Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level. This approach provides a robust AI-based framework for predicting feed intake in individual animals and pens, with potential applications in precision management of feedlot cattle, through feed waste reduction, resource optimization, and climate-adaptive livestock management.",

The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing. Future model development in clinical prediction tasks using EHRs could build upon this study's recommendation as a starting point.",

ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization.

    "abstract": "Lightweight language models remain attractive for on-device and privacy-sensitive applications, but their responses are highly sensitive to prompt quality. For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9).

    "abstract": "We introduce WorldGen, a system that enables the automatic creation of large-scale, interactive 3D worlds directly from text prompts. Our approach transforms natural language descriptions into traversable, fully textured environments that can be immediately explored or edited within standard game engines. By combining LLM-driven scene layout reasoning, procedural generation, diffusion-based 3D generation, and object-aware scene decomposition, WorldGen bridges the gap between creative intent and functional virtual spaces, allowing creators to design coherent, navigable worlds without manual modeling or specialized 3D expertise. The system is fully modular and supports fine-grained control over layout, scale, and style, producing worlds that are geometrically consistent, visually rich, and efficient to render in real time. This work represents a step towards accessible, generative world-building at scale, advancing the frontier of 3D generative AI for applications in gaming, simulation, and immersive social environments.",

    "abstract": "In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.",

Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.",

    "abstract": "3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.",

    "abstract": "We study a systematic approach to a popular Statistical Arbitrage technique: Pairs Trading. Instead of relying on two highly correlated assets, we replace the second asset with a replication of the first using risk factor representations. These factors are obtained through Principal Components Analysis (PCA), exchange traded funds (ETFs), and, as our main contribution, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Residuals between the main asset and its replication are examined for mean reversion properties, and trading signals are generated for sufficiently fast mean reverting portfolios.\n  Beyond introducing a deep learning based replication method, we adapt the framework of Avellaneda and Lee (2008) to the Polish market. Accordingly, components of WIG20, mWIG40, and selected sector indices replace the original S&P500 universe, and market parameters such as the risk free rate and transaction costs are updated to reflect local conditions.\n  We outline the full strategy pipeline: risk factor construction, residual modeling via the Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, and signal generation. Each replication technique is described together with its practical implementation. Strategy performance is evaluated over two periods: 2017-2019 and the recessive year 2020.\n  All methods yield profits in 2017-2019, with PCA achieving roughly 20 percent cumulative return and an annualized Sharpe ratio of up to 2.63. Despite multiple adaptations, our conclusions remain consistent with those of the original paper. During the COVID-19 recession, only the ETF based approach remains profitable (about 5 percent annual return), while PCA and LSTM methods underperform. LSTM results, although negative, are promising and indicate potential for future optimization.",

The theorem provides not only convergence guarantees but also a priori estimates of the achievable solution accuracy. Empirical evaluations on standard regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform Adam on the Australian and MUSH datasets.

GN_k attains performance comparable to full Newton's method on regression tasks while requiring significantly fewer derivative evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.",

While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research. To accelerate progress, we release data preparation recipes, training protocols, and pretrained models, paving the way toward universal audio understanding.",

We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift.

    "abstract": "The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.",

    "abstract": "We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., \"yellow school bus\"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

    "abstract": "Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning & knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale.",

The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk.

    "abstract": "Neutron imaging is essential for diagnosing and optimizing inertial confinement fusion implosions at the National Ignition Facility. Due to the required 10-micrometer resolution, however, neutron image require image reconstruction using iterative algorithms. For low-yield sources, the images may be degraded by various types of noise. Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring the edges where the source information is encoded. Traditional denoising techniques, such as filtering and thresholding, can inadvertently alter critical features or reshape the noise statistics, potentially impacting the ultimate fidelity of the iterative image reconstruction pipeline. However, recent advances in synthetic data production and machine learning have opened new opportunities to address these challenges. In this study, we present an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space, designed to suppress for mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise while preserving essential image features. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Benchmarking against both simulated and experimental NIF datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation compared to conventional filtering methods such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). By validating the effectiveness of unsupervised learning for denoising neutron images, this study establishes a critical first step towards fully AI-driven, end-to-end reconstruction frameworks for ICF diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r},\\ B\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times r}$ with $r\\ll \\min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.",

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with algorithms based on decision trees, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. While the former analyze price patterns of financial assets, the latter are fed with economic data of companies. Numerical simulations of algorithmic trading with data from international companies and 10-weekday predictions confirm that an approach based on both fundamental and technical variables can outperform the usual approaches, which do not combine those two types of variables. In doing so, Random Forest turned out to be the best performer among the decision trees. We also discuss how the prediction performance of such a hybrid approach can be boosted by selecting the technical variables.",

The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifying symmetry reasoning within the proof, but developing efficient methods for this has remained a long-standing open challenge. A fully general approach was recently proposed by Bogaerts et al. (2023), but it relies on encoding lexicographic orders with big integers, which quickly becomes infeasible for large symmetries. In this work, we develop a method for instead encoding orders with auxiliary variables. We show that this leads to orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in both theory and practice by running experiments on proof logging and checking for SAT symmetry breaking using the state-of-the-art satsuma symmetry breaker and the VeriPB proof checking toolchain.",

In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.",

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis -- where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones -- and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.",

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.",

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.",

To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.",

Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design\". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature.

Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem. Second, we leverage these results and propose a new Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for these more general temporal properties, and we prove the soundness and completeness of our method.",

This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we design a reservoir computing (RC) network by exploiting short- and long-term memory dynamics in Au/Ti/MoS$_2$/Au memristive devices. The temporal dynamics is engineered by controlling the thickness of the Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) MoS$_2$ films. Devices with a monolayer (1L)-MoS$_2$ film exhibit volatile (short-term memory) switching dynamics. We also report non-volatile resistance switching with excellent uniformity and analog behavior in conductance tuning for the multilayer (ML) MoS$_2$ memristive devices. We correlate this performance with trap-assisted space-charge limited conduction (SCLC) mechanism, leading to a bulk-limited resistance switching behavior. Four-bit reservoir states are generated using volatile memristors. The readout layer is implemented with an array of nonvolatile synapses. This small RC network achieves 89.56\\% precision in a spoken-digit recognition task and is also used to analyze a nonlinear time series equation.",

    "abstract": "Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.",

We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA through DSPy to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's kappa of 0.816.

    "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.\n  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful, instruction-following teacher LLM (FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets reveal a key finding: the distillation process not only transfers knowledge but also acts as a noise filter. Our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, demonstrating an emergent ability to correct hallucinations present in the teacher's outputs. While achieving a 24x speedup and a 10x reduction in memory consumption, our analysis validates that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality, and perhaps more importantly, trustworthy explainable recommendation.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.\n  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.\n  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70% and 4.27% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.",

    "abstract": "Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.",

We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains.

Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\\% relative mAP gain.

Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.",

Dynamic operator configuration approaches attempt to alleviate this issue, but they typically rely on predefined operator structures and localized parameter control, lacking sustained adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for online operator design in Evolutionary Optimization, named LLM4EO, comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, operators are initialized by leveraging LLMs to distill and transfer knowledge from well-established operators. Then, search behaviors and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance with evolutionary features, accompanied by suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, an LLM-driven meta-operator dynamically optimizes gene selection of operators by prompt-guided improvement strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of solutions and operators within a unified optimization framework, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks of flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms tailored EAs.",

By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \\textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows.

However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.",

    "abstract": "People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.",

In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems.

    "abstract": "Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.",

However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.",

In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.",

    "abstract": "Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.",

However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.",

We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme.

We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains.

    "abstract": "Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.",

However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.\n  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.\n  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "Dendrite-inspired neurons have been widely used in tasks such as image classification due to low computational complexity and fast inference speed. Temporal data prediction, as a key machine learning task, plays a key role in real-time scenarios such as sensor data analysis, financial forecasting, and urban traffic management. However, existing dendrite-inspired neurons are mainly designed for static data. Studies on capturing dynamic features and modeling long-term dependencies in temporal sequences remain limited. Efficient architectures specifically designed for temporal sequence prediction are still lacking. In this paper, we propose Memory-DD, a low-complexity dendrite-inspired neuron model. Memory-DD consists of two dendrite-inspired neuron groups that contain no nonlinear activation functions but can still realize nonlinear mappings. Compared with traditional neurons without dendritic functions, Memory-DD requires only two neuron groups to extract logical relationships between features in input sequences. This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and is suitable for both classification and regression tasks on sequence data. Experimental results show that Memory-DD achieves an average accuracy of 89.41% on 18 temporal classification benchmark datasets, outperforming LSTM by 4.25%. On 9 temporal regression datasets, it reaches comparable performance to LSTM, while using only 50% of the parameters and reducing computational complexity (FLOPs) by 27.7%. These results demonstrate that Memory-DD successfully extends the low-complexity advantages of dendrite-inspired neurons to temporal prediction, providing a low-complexity and efficient solution for time-series data processing.",

To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.",

    "abstract": "As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture \"template-over-safety flip\": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding ``hallucinating'' falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. SeSE operates in a zero-resource manner and is applicable to both open- and closed-source LLMs, making it an ``off-the-shelf\" solution for new models and tasks. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation, we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines.",

    "abstract": "This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.",

    "abstract": "We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.",

    "abstract": "Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.",

This work, SpecActor, achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast draft path to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges that hinder speculation efficiency: (1) a Decoupled speculation method that overcomes the computation inefficiency issue when executing speculative decoding with relative large per-worker batch size -- a common configuration in training but unfriendly to speculation, and (2) a Fastest-of-N speculation method that selects and combines different draft methods according to the rollout progress to approximate the optimal draft method even when the best one is unknown a priori. Extensive evaluations on production traces show that SpecActor accelerates mean rollout speed by 2.0--2.4x, with up to 2.7x speedup, over common post-training baselines. The results are consistent across both dense and MoE models and across different RL algorithms. Notably, SpecActor is 1.1--2.6x faster compared to vanilla speculative rollout in different traces. The accelerated rollout achieves 1.4--2.3x faster end-to-end training time.",

Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets.

The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.",

In that context, evaluating to what extent information can be retrieved from the sole knowledge of reverberant (wet) speech becomes critical. This work investigates the role of the reverberant (wet) phase in the time-frequency domain. Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.",

    "abstract": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered significant attention for their promise of improved parameter efficiency and explainability compared to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). KANs' key innovation lies in the use of learnable non-linear activation functions, which are parametrized as splines. Splines are expressed as a linear combination of basis functions (B-splines). B-splines prove particularly challenging to accelerate due to their recursive definition. Systolic Array (SA)based architectures have shown great promise as DNN accelerators thanks to their energy efficiency and low latency. However, their suitability and efficiency in accelerating KANs have never been assessed. Thus, in this work, we explore the use of SA architecture to accelerate the KAN inference. We show that, while SAs can be used to accelerate part of the KAN inference, their utilization can be reduced to 30%. Hence, we propose KAN-SAs, a novel SA-based accelerator that leverages intrinsic properties of B-splines to enable efficient KAN inference. By including a nonrecursive B-spline implementation and leveraging the intrinsic KAN sparsity, KAN-SAs enhances conventional SAs, enabling efficient KAN inference, in addition to conventional DNNs. KAN-SAs achieves up to 100% SA utilization and up to 50% clock cycles reduction compared to conventional SAs of equivalent area, as shown by hardware synthesis results on a 28nm FD-SOI technology. We also evaluate different configurations of the accelerator on various KAN applications, confirming the improved efficiency of KAN inference provided by KAN-SAs.",

We propose TS-PEFT, a theoretically grounded framework utilizing proximal optimization to dynamically identify and skip redundant token updates during training. Our extensive experiments across Natural Language Understanding, Commonsense Reasoning, and Visual Instruction Tuning demonstrate that indiscriminately updating all tokens is not only computationally superfluous but often introduces optimization noise. Strikingly, by discarding 40%-60% of token updates, TS-PEFT consistently matches or surpasses the performance of dense baselines (e.g., LoRA, DoRA). Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis revealing that the learned token-level sparsity serves as a superior indicator of module importance compared to traditional weight norms, offering a novel data-driven perspective on the intrinsic adaptation mechanism of large models.",

This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) with GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints)-a novel alignment framework that structured medical standards into a multi-perspective matrix to guide both data generation and model optimization. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a medical standard system that embeds domain-specific guidelines throughout the training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, transitioning from rule-based or LLM-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for better evaluation performance; and (3) geometric projection reference constraints that translate clinical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and facilitating training with synthetically generated data. Extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of the base Qwen-32B model, with improvements of 45% on the full subset and 85% on the hard subset.

Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications.",

    "abstract": "Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial in industrial applications, yet existing approaches often struggle to generate long sequence parametric commands due to complex CAD models' geometric and topological constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MamTiff-CAD, a novel CAD parametric command sequences generation framework that leverages a Transformer-based diffusion model for multi-scale latent representations. Specifically, we design a novel autoencoder that integrates Mamba+ and Transformer, to transfer parameterized CAD sequences into latent representations. The Mamba+ block incorporates a forget gate mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The non-autoregressive Transformer decoder reconstructs the latent representations. A diffusion model based on multi-scale Transformer is then trained on these latent embeddings to learn the distribution of long sequence commands. In addition, we also construct a dataset that consists of long parametric sequences, which is up to 256 commands for a single CAD model. Experiments demonstrate that MamTiff-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both reconstruction and generation tasks, confirming its effectiveness for long sequence (60-256) CAD model generation.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.",

We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena.

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across twelve cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in nine additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.",

While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.",

    "abstract": "Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

    "abstract": "Modern data processing workflows frequently encounter ragged data: collections with variable-length elements that arise naturally in domains like natural language processing, scientific measurements, and autonomous AI agents. Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.",

We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space.

    "abstract": "Most of the traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) depend on strict matching using keywords, where candidates that are highly qualified are many times disqualified because of minor semantic differences. In this article, the two-stage process of developing a more comprehensive resume assessment system based on a small language model that is trained with fewer than 600M parameters is introduced and fine-tuned by using GRPO with a uniquely designed reward function. The initial stage is Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which is used to create a strong base model with the ability to perceive resumes beyond superficial overlap of keywords. This SFT model is further optimized in the second step with Reinforcement Learning (RL) via GRPO with the help of multi-component-based rewarding, which will not be considered as a commission of tokens matching. In the initial RL experiments, we found a severe difficulty in the shape of reward hacking: overly aggressive penalty terms resulted in unstable training dynamics and prohibitively negative model behavior. This was solved by trial-and-error refinement of the reward and careful training hyperparameter tuning, which led to a stable and controlled process of gentle polishing. The GRPO-refined model shows high real-life performance, as it shows an accuracy of 91% on unseen data used for testing. It has a high recall of 0.85 on the SELECTED class with a perfect precision of 1.0, which highlights its high reliability for identifying qualified applicants. These findings demonstrate that an appropriately structured two-step fine-tuning pipeline can effectively be used to transfer a small language model into human-like candidate evaluation, surpassing the shortcomings of both traditional ATS systems and unrefined uses of reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.",

We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.",

    "abstract": "Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.",

We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a \"narrative mind\" that complements the \"weak,\" historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling \"plan to execution\" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.",

    ],
    "abstract": "In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.",

Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone.

    "abstract": "Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.",

    "abstract": "Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the secure deployment of large language models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to implant hidden behaviors triggered by specific inputs. However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \\textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \\textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.",

    "abstract": "LLMs generate buggy code: 29.6% of SWE-bench solved patches fail, 62% of BaxBench solutions have vulnerabilities, and existing tools only catch 65% of bugs with 35% false positives. We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, using submodularity of mutual information under conditional independence. Measuring agent correlation of rho = 0.05 to 0.25 confirms they detect different bugs. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method (Meta Prompt Testing: 75%) while running faster and without test execution. We tested all 15 agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with diminishing returns of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4, validating our theoretical model. The best two-agent combination (Correctness + Performance) reaches 79.3% accuracy.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.",

    "abstract": "Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \\texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.",

We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix.

    "abstract": "Structural connectomes are detailed graphs that map how different brain regions are physically connected, offering critical insight into aging, cognition, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, these connectomes are high-dimensional and densely interconnected, which makes them difficult to interpret and analyze at scale. While low-dimensional spaces like PCA and autoencoders are often used to capture major sources of variation, their latent spaces are generally continuous and cannot fully reflect the mixed nature of variability in connectomes, which include both continuous (e.g., connectivity strength) and discrete factors (e.g., imaging site). Motivated by this, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hybrid latent space that jointly models the discrete and continuous components. We analyze a large dataset of 5,761 connectomes from six Alzheimer's disease studies with ten acquisition protocols. Each connectome represents a single scan from a unique subject (3579 females, 2182 males), aged 22 to 102, with 4338 cognitively normal, 809 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 614 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each connectome contains 121 brain regions defined by the BrainCOLOR atlas. We train our hybrid VAE in an unsupervised way and characterize what each latent component captures. We find that the discrete space is particularly effective at capturing subtle site-related differences, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.65 with site labels, significantly outperforming PCA and a standard VAE followed by clustering (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the hybrid latent space can disentangle distinct sources of variability in connectomes in an unsupervised manner, offering potential for large-scale connectome analysis.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.",

In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning.

Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.",

Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.",

This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs.

The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.",

    "abstract": "We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.",

    "abstract": "While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.",

The system is scalable, modular, and reconfigurable, supporting various model sizes and context lengths, and is ideal for deploying agentic workflows for enterprise AI applications in existing data center (cloud, on-prem) environments.

    "abstract": "Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.",

Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.",

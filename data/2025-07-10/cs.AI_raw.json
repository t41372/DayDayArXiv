    "abstract": "Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.",

From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence (the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration. The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.",

Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space, with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.",

This paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI solution, the \"Purple Agent,\" which integrates adversarial exploration and defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.",

Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist, Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure scenarios that align with their specific goals.",

Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge components via long-range correlations.",

    "abstract": "As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.",

Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN (to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence agents.

As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set, based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO (human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.\n  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model (LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the \"nnlm\" approach, which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $τ=0.8487$. However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4 were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.",

We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression: inferring the maximum compression a given context supports before significant performance loss. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 68%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families. Finally, we release compactor-vllm, an inference engine and suite of optimized Triton kernels designed to efficiently support the sparse, non-contiguous memory access patterns inherent to compressed KV caches. This work demonstrates that Compactor offers a practical, high-performance solution for alleviating the memory bottleneck in modern LLM deployment.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.",

This model was trained and evaluated on a unique multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents, particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building height estimation from single VHR SAR data.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved methods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional predictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that fail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced integration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer better accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN clinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting daily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented with a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset included behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features. Experiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream combinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and Linear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985 vs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed signs of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance, while the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when integrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF), underscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion offers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with multimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.",

To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning.

In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.",

STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks.

Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution. The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.",

However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page: https://GeometryForcing.github.io.",

The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.",

    "abstract": "We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.",

We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).",

    "abstract": "Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention, existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative models, such as diffusion models, have raised concerns related to privacy, copyright infringement, and data stewardship. To better understand and control these risks, prior work has introduced techniques and attacks that reconstruct images, or parts of images, from training data. While these results demonstrate that training data can be recovered, existing methods often rely on high computational resources, partial access to the training set, or carefully engineered prompts.\n  In this work, we present a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the training data, and identifies seemingly benign prompts that can lead to potentially risky image reconstruction. We further show that such reconstructions may occur unintentionally, even for users without specialized knowledge. For example, we observe that for one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' generates the face of a real individual. Moreover, by combining the identified vulnerabilities with real-world prompt data, we discover prompts that reproduce memorized visual elements.\n  Our approach builds on insights from prior work and leverages domain knowledge to expose a fundamental vulnerability arising from the use of scraped e-commerce data, where templated layouts and images are closely tied to pattern-like textual prompts.\n  The code for our attack is publicly available at https://github.com/TheSolY/lr-tmi.",

We use an LLM-based pipeline to classify the O*NET work activities assisted or performed by AI in each conversation. We find that the most common and successful AI-assisted work activities involve information work--the creation, processing, and communication of information. At the occupation level, we find widespread AI applicability cutting across sectors, as most occupations have information work components. Our methodology also allows us to predict which occupations are more likely to delegate tasks to AI and which are more likely to use AI to assist existing workflows.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies, leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices, we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.",

Participants discussed their views on current commercial tools, their potential integration into traditional coaching, and suggestions for enhancing these systems.\n  Results and Conclusions: Experts acknowledged the value of AI tools in handling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus on higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools, emphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected feedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model combining traditional coaching with AI-supported exercises.",

    "abstract": "Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights. Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances, high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.",

While compatible with low-power microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization. It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and 27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.",

This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase schedule to train a foundation model--initially devoid of embodied spatial knowledge--into a world model that is controllable by motion intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that AirScape significantly outperforms existing foundation models in 3D spatial imagination capabilities, especially with over a 50% improvement in metrics reflecting motion alignment.

    "abstract": "Watermarking enables GenAI providers to verify whether content was generated by their models. A watermark is a hidden signal in the content, whose presence can be detected using a secret watermark key. A core security threat are forgery attacks, where adversaries insert the provider's watermark into content \\emph{not} produced by the provider, potentially damaging their reputation and undermining trust. Existing defenses resist forgery by embedding many watermarks with multiple keys into the same content, which can degrade model utility. However, forgery remains a threat when attackers can collect sufficiently many watermarked samples. We propose a defense that is provably forgery-resistant \\emph{independent} of the number of watermarked content collected by the attacker, provided they cannot easily distinguish watermarks from different keys. Our scheme does not further degrade model utility. We randomize the watermark key selection for each query and accept content as genuine only if a watermark is detected by \\emph{exactly} one key. We focus on the image and text modalities, but our defense is modality-agnostic, since it treats the underlying watermarking method as a black-box. Our method provably bounds the attacker's success rate and we empirically observe a reduction from near-perfect success rates to only $2\\%$ at negligible computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level. Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We formalize this through a composite operator $φ(\\cdot, γ(\\cdot))$ where $φ$ drives the main semantic convergence while $γ$ resolves local sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to transfinite contexts, a novel $φ$-topology based on the Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the \"semantic virus\" concept it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory, and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure mathematical abstraction.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called \"blockchain trilemma,\" a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust, we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.",

    "abstract": "Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models. However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.",

Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models, because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly -- because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.",

However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering (QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process, likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG, providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in knowledge-intensive AI applications.",

Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted.

Adaptive sensing proactively modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.

General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.",

    "abstract": "Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models.

If such embeddings are semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible. We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in the semantic space.",

    "abstract": "Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.",

Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention, the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229 objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions, particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.",

Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the community has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers. Here, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a potentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic programming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be synthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a constraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In this work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining not just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To demonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates and solves these constraints. We evaluate BART on program space enumeration tasks, finding that the constraints eliminate up to 99 percent of the program space, and that modeling program spaces significantly reduces enumeration time.",

Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.",

Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across various benchmarks.",

Existing unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of ``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm: One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval, prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal artificial intelligence.

    "abstract": "With the growth of demand on neural network compression methods, the structured pruning methods including importance-based approach are actively studied. The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance criteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with larger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even if it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning, with promising performance after the finetuning. Our work debunks the ``size-matters'' myth in pruning and expands the frontier of importance-based pruning both theoretically and empirically.",

    "abstract": "The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200 years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments. Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e. lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre. Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y = alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta) and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to be the most predictive.",

    "abstract": "Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep neural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional regularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to magnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes are likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost zero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a filter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the precise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model performance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in an extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed Catalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with theoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior achieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the pruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world effectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm. Pruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art filter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and fair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.",

    "abstract": "Direct Preference Learning has emerged as a dominant offline paradigm for preference optimization. Most of these methods are based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model for pairwise preference ranking, which directly aligns language model with human preference. Prior work has observed a counter-intuitive phenomenon termed likelihood displacement, where the absolute probability of preferred responses decreases simultaneously during training. We demonstrate that such displacement can lead to a more devastating failure mode, which we defined as \\textit{Catastrophic Preference Shift}, where the lost preference probability mass inadvertently shifts toward out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. Such a failure mode is a key limitation shared across BT-style direct preference learning methods, due to the fundamental conflict between the unconstrained discriminative alignment and generative foundational capabilities, ultimately leading to severe performance degradation (e.g., SimPO suffers a significant drop in reasoning accuracy from 73.5\\% to 37.5\\%). We analyze existing BT-style methods from the probability evolution perspective and theoretically prove that these methods exhibit over-reliance on model initialization and can lead to preference shift. To resolve these counter-intuitive behaviors, we propose a theoretically grounded Stable Preference Optimization (SPO) framework that constrains preference learning within a safe alignment region. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SPO effectively stabilizes and enhances the performance of existing BT-style preference learning methods. SPO provides new insights into the design of preference learning objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.",

At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.",

Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior research has examined how context affects user responses to generic notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions. Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with and act upon the intervention.\n  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components: acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions. The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility, and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also actionable in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data, significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile (Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers. In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability, requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested in this study.",

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph, outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance, as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI applications in domain-specific fields.",

    "abstract": "Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\\%$ while discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure inference in scattering amplitudes.",

The benchmark covers core spatial tasks, including distance measurement, visibility, path finding, and object placement within constrained spaces. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs reveal that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to respect physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, though they remain mostly robust to small spatial perturbations. FloorplanQA uncovers a blind spot in today's LLMs: inconsistent reasoning about indoor layouts. We hope this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.",

While LLMs achieve high consistency at the technical level, this consistency demonstrates both positive and negative effects. Through comprehensive analysis of recent data on LLM judicial applications from 2023--2025, this study finds that addressing this challenge requires understanding both task and stakeholder dimensions. This study proposes the Dual-Track Deliberative Multi-Role LLM Judicial Governance Framework (DTDMR-LJGF), which enables intelligent task classification and meaningful interaction among diverse stakeholders.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important, low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models.",

To our best of knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics, namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors' logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.",

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion language models learn to reconstruct text from randomly masked inputs, yet under mild assumptions their denoiser already implements the exact Bayesian posterior over the original tokens. We prove that the expected denoiser output under the forward corruption distribution recovers the true posterior, and that a simple Monte Carlo estimator converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)) with finite-sample concentration bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce an inference-time ensemble that runs K independent denoising passes and aggregates both posterior means and variances without any extra training. On WikiText-2, our MC-marginal sampler recovers the analytic lambda-DCE zero-shot perplexity (approximately 39) to within a few points at K=128, and its per-token variance shows a strong rank correlation with reconstruction error (Spearman rho = 0.996). This cost-proportional procedure yields calibrated uncertainty estimates and a direct trade-off between compute and posterior fidelity in discrete diffusion LMs.",

This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM (InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools, emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance. These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and explainable AI pipeline.",

    "abstract": "What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use. AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with substantial performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose two simple retrieval strategies that address this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages or by translating the query, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as catastrophic forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice, and Spaced Repetition, named Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay framework with a mechanism we term the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and the Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to Standard Experience Replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.",

Despite experimenting with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset, likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.",

In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.",

Since these HPO tools have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g., chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna, an open-source framework for HPO.",

Moreover, patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using data from different structures, categories, and distributions.",

Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.",

We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering.

We propose \\textbf{\\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1) Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2) Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon publication.",

TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations, enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of 85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and 90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI, significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.",

To address this issue, we develop HomeLLaMA, an on-device assistant for privacy-preserving and personalized smart home serving with a tailored small language model (SLM). HomeLLaMA learns from cloud LLMs to deliver satisfactory responses and enable user-friendly interactions. Once deployed, HomeLLaMA facilitates proactive interactions by continuously updating local SLMs and user profiles. To further enhance user experience while protecting their privacy, we develop PrivShield to offer an optional privacy-preserving LLM-based smart home serving for those users, who are unsatisfied with local responses and willing to send less-sensitive queries to remote servers. For evaluation, we build a comprehensive benchmark DevFinder to assess the service quality. Extensive experiments and user studies (M=100) demonstrate that HomeLLaMA can provide personalized services while significantly enhancing user privacy.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repositioning. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines.

For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \\textbf{BundleNet}, a novel bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms generated by \\textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the multi-slot setting.

To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency, the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest path length ranging between 4 and 5.

As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time responsiveness.

    "abstract": "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues. We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above 80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into modern cybersecurity frameworks.",

    "abstract": "The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed, significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress in automated decision systems and decision support systems.",

To address these issues, we propose GTED (Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. Across the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED consistently ranks as a top-performing metric, achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa on miniF2F and the joint-highest accuracy on ProofNet. This strong overall performance provides the community with a computationally lightweight and more faithful metric for automated evaluation.

Existing motion transfer methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment (motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder, allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our proposed model.",

However, dynamic and unknown environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization. PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication, significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future MASAR applications.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient: clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI (XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their clinical actionable outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.",

Compared to standard neural network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter. Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.",

Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.",

We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization with simulator interactions.

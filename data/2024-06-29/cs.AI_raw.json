    "abstract": "Real-time Advisory (RTA) systems, such as navigational and eco-driving\nassistants, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in vehicles due to their\nbenefits for users and society. Until autonomous vehicles mature, such advisory\nsystems will continue to expand their ability to cooperate with drivers,\nenabling safer and more eco-friendly driving practices while improving user\nexperience. However, the interactions between these systems and drivers have\nnot been studied extensively. To this end, we conduct a driving simulator study\n(N=16) to capture driver reactions to a Cooperative RTA system. Through a case\nstudy with a congestion mitigation assistant, we qualitatively analyze the\nsentiments of drivers towards advisory systems and discuss driver preferences\nfor various aspects of the interaction. We comment on how the advice should be\ncommunicated, the effects of the advice on driver trust, and how drivers adapt\nto the system. We present recommendations to inform the future design of\nCooperative RTA systems.",

    "abstract": "Evidence to guide healthcare decisions is often limited by a lack of relevant\nand trustworthy literature as well as difficulty in contextualizing existing\nresearch for a specific patient. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially\naddress both challenges by either summarizing published literature or\ngenerating new studies based on real-world data (RWD). We evaluated the ability\nof five LLM-based systems in answering 50 clinical questions and had nine\nindependent physicians review the responses for relevance, reliability, and\nactionability. As it stands, general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3 Opus,\nGemini Pro 1.5) rarely produced answers that were deemed relevant and\nevidence-based (2% - 10%). In contrast, retrieval augmented generation\n(RAG)-based and agentic LLM systems produced relevant and evidence-based\nanswers for 24% (OpenEvidence) to 58% (ChatRWD) of questions. Only the agentic\nChatRWD was able to answer novel questions compared to other LLMs (65% vs.\n0-9%). These results suggest that while general-purpose LLMs should not be used\nas-is, a purpose-built system for evidence summarization based on RAG and one\nfor generating novel evidence working synergistically would improve\navailability of pertinent evidence for patient care.",

    "abstract": "The shift towards efficient and automated data analysis through Machine\nLearning (ML) has notably impacted healthcare systems, particularly Radiomics.\nRadiomics leverages ML to analyze medical images accurately and efficiently for\nprecision medicine. Current methods rely on Deep Learning (DL) to improve\nperformance and accuracy (Deep Radiomics). Given the sensitivity of medical\nimages, ensuring privacy throughout the Deep Radiomics pipeline-from data\ngeneration and collection to model training and inference-is essential,\nespecially when outsourced. Thus, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are\ncrucial tools for Deep Radiomics. Previous studies and systematization efforts\nhave either broadly overviewed PETs and their applications or mainly focused on\nsubsets of PETs for ML algorithms. In Deep Radiomics, where efficiency,\naccuracy, and privacy are crucial, many PETs, while theoretically applicable,\nmay not be practical without specialized optimizations or hybrid designs.\nAdditionally, not all DL models are suitable for Radiomics. Consequently, there\nis a need for specialized studies that investigate and systematize the\neffective and practical integration of PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline.\nThis work addresses this research gap by (1) classifying existing PETs,\npresenting practical hybrid PETS constructions, and a taxonomy illustrating\ntheir potential integration with the Deep Radiomics pipeline, with comparative\nanalyses detailing assumptions, architectural suitability, and security, (2)\nOffering technical insights, describing potential challenges and means of\ncombining PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline, including integration\nstrategies, subtilities, and potential challenges, (3) Proposing potential\nresearch directions, identifying challenges, and suggesting solutions to\nenhance the PETs in Deep Radiomics.",

    "abstract": "Instruction subsets are heuristics that can reduce the size of the inductive\nprogramming search space by tens of orders of magnitude. Comprising many\noverlapping subsets of different sizes, they serve as predictions of the\ninstructions required to code a solution for any problem. Currently, this\napproach employs a single, large family of subsets meaning that some problems\ncan search thousands of subsets before a solution is found. In this paper we\nintroduce the use of test case type signatures as hyper-heuristics to select\none of many, smaller families of instruction subsets. The type signature for\nany set of test cases maps directly to a single family and smaller families\nmean that fewer subsets need to be considered for most problems. Having many\nfamilies also permits subsets to be reordered to better reflect their relative\noccurrence in human code - again reducing the search space size for many\nproblems. Overall the new approach can further reduce the size of the inductive\nprogramming search space by between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude, depending on\nthe type signature. Larger and more consistent reductions are possible through\nthe use of more sophisticated type systems. The potential use of additional\ntest case features as hyper-heuristics and some other possible future work is\nalso briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Poor bucking decisions made by forest harvesters can have a negative effect\non the products that are generated from the logs. Making the right bucking\ndecisions is not an easy task because harvesters must rely on predictions of\nthe stem profile for the part of the stems that is not yet measured. The goal\nof this project is to improve the bucking decisions made by forest harvesters\nwith a stochastic bucking method. We developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network that predicted the parameters of a Gaussian distribution\nconditioned on the known part of the stem, enabling the creation of multiple\nsamples of stem profile predictions for the unknown part of the stem. The\nbucking decisions could then be optimized using a novel stochastic bucking\nalgorithm which used all the stem profiles generated to choose the logs to\ngenerate from the stem. The stochastic bucking algorithm was compared to two\nbenchmark models: A polynomial model that could not condition its predictions\non more than one diameter measurement, and a deterministic LSTM neural network.\nAll models were evaluated on stem profiles of four coniferous species prevalent\nin eastern Canada. In general, the best bucking decisions were taken by the\nstochastic LSTM models, demonstrating the usefulness of the method. The\nsecond-best results were mostly obtained by the deterministic LSTM model and\nthe worst results by the polynomial model, corroborating the usefulness of\nconditioning the stem curve predictions on multiple measurements.",

In this paper, we proposed a new Explainable Artificial\nIntelligence (XAI) method called ShapG (Explanations based on Shapley value for\nGraphs) for measuring feature importance. ShapG is a model-agnostic global\nexplanation method. At the first stage, it defines an undirected graph based on\nthe dataset, where nodes represent features and edges are added based on\ncalculation of correlation coefficients between features. At the second stage,\nit calculates an approximated Shapley value by sampling the data taking into\naccount this graph structure. The sampling approach of ShapG allows to\ncalculate the importance of features efficiently, i.e. to reduce computational\ncomplexity. Comparison of ShapG with other existing XAI methods shows that it\nprovides more accurate explanations for two examined datasets. We also compared\nother XAI methods developed based on cooperative game theory with ShapG in\nrunning time, and the results show that ShapG exhibits obvious advantages in\nits running time, which further proves efficiency of ShapG. In addition,\nextensive experiments demonstrate a wide range of applicability of the ShapG\nmethod for explaining complex models. We find ShapG an important tool in\nimproving explainability and transparency of AI systems and believe it can be\nwidely used in various fields.",

We introduce ``Intrinsic PAPR'', a novel method based on the recent\npoint-based neural rendering technique Proximity Attention Point Rendering\n(PAPR). Unlike other point-based methods that model the intrinsic decomposition\nof the scene, our approach does not rely on complicated shading models or\nsimplistic priors that may not universally apply. Instead, we directly model\nscene decomposition into albedo and shading components, leading to better\nestimation accuracy. Comparative evaluations against the latest point-based\ninverse rendering methods demonstrate that Intrinsic PAPR achieves\nhigher-quality novel view rendering and superior point-level albedo and shading\nediting.",

    "abstract": "Task allocation is a key combinatorial optimization problem, crucial for\nmodern applications such as multi-robot cooperation and resource scheduling.\nDecision makers must allocate entities to tasks reasonably across different\nscenarios. However, traditional methods assume static attributes and numbers of\ntasks and entities, often relying on dynamic programming and heuristic\nalgorithms for solutions. In reality, task allocation resembles Markov decision\nprocesses, with dynamically changing task and entity attributes. Thus,\nalgorithms must dynamically allocate tasks based on their states. To address\nthis issue, we propose a two-stage task allocation algorithm based on\nsimilarity, utilizing reinforcement learning to learn allocation strategies.\nThe proposed pre-assign strategy allows entities to preselect appropriate\ntasks, effectively avoiding local optima and thereby better finding the optimal\nallocation. We also introduce an attention mechanism and a hyperparameter\nnetwork structure to adapt to the changing number and attributes of entities\nand tasks, enabling our network structure to generalize to new tasks.\nExperimental results across multiple environments demonstrate that our\nalgorithm effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic task allocation in\npractical applications. Compared to heuristic algorithms like genetic\nalgorithms, our reinforcement learning approach better solves dynamic\nallocation problems and achieves zero-shot generalization to new tasks with\ngood performance.

However, this notion of\nspuriousness, which is usually introduced due to sampling biases in the\ndataset, has classically lacked a formal definition. To address this gap, this\nwork presents the first information-theoretic formalization of spuriousness in\na dataset (given a split of spurious and core features) using a mathematical\nframework called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). Specifically, we\ndisentangle the joint information content that the spurious and core features\nshare about another target variable (e.g., the prediction label) into distinct\ncomponents, namely unique, redundant, and synergistic information. We propose\nthe use of unique information, with roots in Blackwell Sufficiency, as a novel\nmetric to formally quantify dataset spuriousness and derive its desirable\nproperties. We empirically demonstrate how higher unique information in the\nspurious features in a dataset could lead a model into choosing the spurious\nfeatures over the core features for inference, often having low\nworst-group-accuracy. We also propose a novel autoencoder-based estimator for\ncomputing unique information that is able to handle high-dimensional image\ndata. Finally, we also show how this unique information in the spurious feature\nis reduced across several dataset-based spurious-pattern-mitigation techniques\nsuch as data reweighting and varying levels of background mixing, demonstrating\na novel tradeoff between unique information (spuriousness) and\nworst-group-accuracy.",

Each component\nof MSSMs is associated with each cluster. An advantage of the proposed method\nis that it enables the use of time series models appropriate to the specific\ntime series. This not only improves clustering and prediction accuracy but also\nenhances the interpretability of the estimated parameters. The parameters of\nthe MSSMs are estimated using stochastic variational inference, a subtype of\nvariational inference. The proposed method estimates the latent variables of an\narbitrary state space model by using neural networks with a normalizing flow as\na variational estimator. The number of clusters can be estimated using the\nBayesian information criterion. In addition, to prevent MSSMs from converging\nto the local optimum, we propose several optimization tricks, including an\nadditional penalty term called entropy annealing. To our best knowledge, the\nproposed method is the first computationally feasible one for time series\nclustering based on general (possibly nonlinear, non-Gaussian) state space\nmodels. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the proposed method is\neffective for clustering, parameter estimation, and estimating the number of\nclusters.",

Any realistic set of assumptions must account for the fact\nthat other agents may be just as adaptable as our agent is. In this work, we\nconsider the problem of cooperating with a \\textit{population} of agents in a\nfinitely-repeated, two player general-sum matrix game with private utilities.\nTwo natural assumptions in such settings are that: 1) all agents in the\npopulation are individually rational learners, and 2) when any two members of\nthe population are paired together, with high-probability they will achieve at\nleast the same utility as they would under some Pareto efficient equilibrium\nstrategy. Our results first show that these assumptions alone are insufficient\nto ensure \\textit{zero-shot} cooperation with members of the target population.\nWe therefore consider the problem of \\textit{learning} a strategy for\ncooperating with such a population using prior observations its members\ninteracting with one another. We provide upper and lower bounds on the number\nof samples needed to learn an effective cooperation strategy.

This paper briefly summarizes the development\nof the field of missing data with respect to Explainable Artificial\nIntelligence and experimentally investigates the effects of various imputation\nmethods on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a popular technique for\nexplaining the output of complex machine learning models. Next, we compare\ndifferent imputation strategies and assess their impact on feature importance\nand interaction as determined by Shapley values. Moreover, we also\ntheoretically analyze the effects of missing values on Shapley values.\nImportantly, our findings reveal that the choice of imputation method can\nintroduce biases that could lead to changes in the Shapley values, thereby\naffecting the explainability of the model. Moreover, we also show that a lower\ntest prediction MSE (Mean Square Error) does not necessarily imply a lower MSE\nin Shapley values and vice versa. Also, while XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting) is a method that could handle missing data directly, using XGBoost\ndirectly on missing data can seriously affect explainability compared to\nimputing the data before training XGBoost. This study provides a comprehensive\nevaluation of imputation methods in the context of model explanations, offering\npractical guidance for selecting appropriate techniques based on dataset\ncharacteristics and analysis objectives.

Given their varied difficulty,\nin this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their\ncontext length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise\nvocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We\npropose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that\nmake them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes\nof difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information\nin the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find? We\nsurvey the literature on long-context, provide justification for this taxonomy\nas an informative descriptor, and situate the literature with respect to it. We\nconclude that the most difficult and interesting settings, whose necessary\ninformation is very long and highly diffused within the input, is severely\nunder-explored. By using a descriptive vocabulary and discussing the relevant\nproperties of difficulty in long-context, we can implement more informed\nresearch in this area.

Given the resource-intensive nature of\ngathering evaluations on urban visual appeal through surveys or inquiries from\nresidents, there is a constant quest for automated solutions to streamline this\nprocess and support spatial planning. In this study, we applied an\noff-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban visual appeal, using\nover 1,800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the\nGPT-4 model with specified criteria, we assessed these images. Simultaneously,\n24 participants were asked to rate the images. Our results demonstrated a\nstrong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic\ndisparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban\nareas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these\nareas less appealing. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated\nurban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower visual appeal scores than\nparticipant ratings. While there was general agreement between AI and human\nassessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual\nnuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and\nfeatures of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models\nlike GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the visual appeal of\ndifferent areas efficiently, aiding decisions that enhance residents' and\ntravellers' satisfaction and mental health. Although AI models provide valuable\ninsights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of\nurban visual appeal.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has attracted increasing\ninterest due to its widespread application. In recent studies, knowledge\ndistillation-based methods have been widely used in unsupervised anomaly\ndetection to improve model efficiency and generalization. However, the inherent\nsymmetry between the source (teacher) and target (student) networks typically\nresults in consistent outputs across both architectures, making it difficult to\ndistinguish abnormal graphs from normal graphs. Also, existing methods mainly\nrely on graph features to distinguish anomalies, which may be unstable with\ncomplex and diverse data and fail to capture the essence that differentiates\nnormal graphs from abnormal ones. In this work, we propose a Graph Normalizing\nFlows-driven Asymmetric Network For Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection\n(FANFOLD in short). We introduce normalizing flows to unsupervised graph-level\nanomaly detection due to their successful application and superior quality in\nlearning the underlying distribution of samples. Specifically, we adopt the\nknowledge distillation technique and apply normalizing flows on the source\nnetwork, achieving the asymmetric network. In the training stage, FANFOLD\ntransforms the original distribution of normal graphs to a standard normal\ndistribution. During inference, FANFOLD computes the anomaly score using the\nsource-target loss to discriminate between normal and anomalous graphs. We\nconduct extensive experiments on 15 datasets of different fields with 9\nbaseline methods to validate the superiority of FANFOLD.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problems of weighted constrained sampling and weighted model\ncounting, where we are given a propositional formula and a weight for each\nworld. The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability\nproportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is\nthe problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula.\nBoth have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning,\ngraphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In\nthis article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing\nweighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both\nare based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are\nmodified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of\ncomputation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean\nfunction given an assignment, QWCS requires\n$O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}}+1/\\sqrt{\\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the\nnumber of Boolean variables and $\\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1\nweighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a\ncomplexity of $\\Omega(1/\\text{WMC})$.

    "abstract": "Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and\nefficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and\nengineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to\nimprove the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall\nmesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods\nare extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary\ngeometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from\nscratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their\napplicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of\ninverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement\nNetwork (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive,\nzero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and\nstructures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary\ngeometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting\nfeatures and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh.\nWe evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well\nas a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing\nlearning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described\nabove. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\\`ere\nPDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh\nmovement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method\nfails.

The performance of\ndeep learning models depends on high-quality data and requires substantial\ntraining resources, making efficient deployment challenging. Core data\nselection, by eliminating low-quality and confusing data, aims to enhance\ntraining efficiency without significantly compromising model performance.\nHowever, distance-based data selection methods struggle to distinguish\ndependencies among high-dimensional caries data. To address this issue, we\npropose a Core Data Selection Method with Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSCDS) for\nefficient caries image learning and caries classification. We describe the core\ndata selection criterion as the distribution of samples in different classes.\nJSCDS calculates the cluster centers by sample embedding representation in the\ncaries classification network and utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to compute\nthe mutual information between data samples and cluster centers, capturing\nnonlinear dependencies among high-dimensional data. The average mutual\ninformation is calculated to fit the above distribution, serving as the\ncriterion for constructing the core set for model training. Extensive\nexperiments on RGB caries datasets show that JSCDS outperforms other data\nselection methods in prediction performance and time consumption.

Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver\nfor conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates\nextensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative\nlarge-scale CO problems. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.",

    "abstract": "Employing a teleoperation system for gathering demonstrations offers the\npotential for more efficient learning of robot manipulation. However,\nteleoperating a robot arm equipped with a dexterous hand or gripper, via a\nteleoperation system presents inherent challenges due to the task's high\ndimensionality, complexity of motion, and differences between physiological\nstructures. In this study, we introduce a novel system for joint learning\nbetween human operators and robots, that enables human operators to share\ncontrol of a robot end-effector with a learned assistive agent, simplifies the\ndata collection process, and facilitates simultaneous human demonstration\ncollection and robot manipulation training. As data accumulates, the assistive\nagent gradually learns. Consequently, less human effort and attention are\nrequired, enhancing the efficiency of the data collection process. It also\nallows the human operator to adjust the control ratio to achieve a trade-off\nbetween manual and automated control. We conducted experiments in both\nsimulated environments and physical real-world settings. Through user studies\nand quantitative evaluations, it is evident that the proposed system could\nenhance data collection efficiency and reduce the need for human adaptation\nwhile ensuring the collected data is of sufficient quality for downstream\ntasks. \\textit{For more details, please refer to our webpage\nhttps://norweig1an.github.io/HAJL.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Bimanual manipulation is challenging due to precise spatial and temporal\ncoordination required between two arms. While there exist several real-world\nbimanual systems, there is a lack of simulated benchmarks with a large task\ndiversity for systematically studying bimanual capabilities across a wide range\nof tabletop tasks. This paper addresses the gap by extending RLBench to\nbimanual manipulation. We open-source our code and benchmark comprising 13 new\ntasks with 23 unique task variations, each requiring a high degree of\ncoordination and adaptability. To kickstart the benchmark, we extended several\nstate-of-the art methods to bimanual manipulation and also present a\nlanguage-conditioned behavioral cloning agent -- PerAct2, which enables the\nlearning and execution of bimanual 6-DoF manipulation tasks. Our novel network\narchitecture efficiently integrates language processing with action prediction,\nallowing robots to understand and perform complex bimanual tasks in response to\nuser-specified goals.

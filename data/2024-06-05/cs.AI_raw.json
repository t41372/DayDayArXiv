    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been notable interest in investigating\ncombinatorial optimization (CO) problems by neural-based framework. An emerging\nstrategy to tackle these challenging problems involves the adoption of graph\nneural networks (GNNs) as an alternative to traditional algorithms, a subject\nthat has attracted considerable attention. Despite the growing popularity of\nGNNs and traditional algorithm solvers in the realm of CO, there is limited\nresearch on their integrated use and the correlation between them within an\nend-to-end framework. The primary focus of our work is to formulate a more\nefficient and precise framework for CO by employing decision-focused learning\non graphs. Additionally, we introduce a decision-focused framework that\nutilizes GNNs to address CO problems with auxiliary support. To realize an\nend-to-end approach, we have designed two cascaded modules: (a) an unsupervised\ntrained graph predictive model, and (b) a solver for quadratic binary\nunconstrained optimization. Empirical evaluations are conducted on various\nclassical tasks, including maximum cut, maximum independent set, and minimum\nvertex cover. The experimental results on classical CO problems (i.e. MaxCut,\nMIS, and MVC) demonstrate the superiority of our method over both the\nstandalone GNN approach and classical methods.",

While active learning research mainly focuses on data\nannotation, we call for a network-centric active learning framework that\nconsiders both annotation (i.e., what is the label) and data acquisition (i.e.,\nwhich and how many samples to collect). Moreover, we explore the synergy\nbetween generative artificial intelligence (AI) and active learning to overcome\nexisting limitations in both active learning and generative AI. This paper also\nfeatures a case study on a mmWave throughput prediction problem to demonstrate\nthe practical benefits and improved performance of active learning for 6G\nnetworks. Furthermore, we discuss how the implications of active learning\nextend to numerous 6G network use cases. We highlight the potential of active\nlearning based 6G networks to enhance computational efficiency, data annotation\nand acquisition efficiency, adaptability, and overall network intelligence.

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of generic 3D scenes is fundamentally challenging\nin computer vision, essential in enhancing applications related to scene\nreconstruction, motion tracking, and avatar creation. In this work, we address\nthe task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By\nobserving a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field\nparameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points\nwithin the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific\npriors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced\ndynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the\ncanonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal\nconsistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required\nparameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame\nmodeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic\nregularization provided by SIREN, and modify the input layer to produce a\nspatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field\nJacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an\ninfinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have\ndifferent behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables\nus to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model\ncompactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a\nregularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness.\nOur experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point\ntrajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The\nresults demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness. The code and data for\nthe project are publicly available:\n\\url{https://yz-cnsdqz.github.io/eigenmotion/DOMA/}",

LID can be\nunderstood as the number of local factors of variation: the more factors of\nvariation a datum has, the more complex it tends to be. Estimating this\nquantity has proven useful in contexts ranging from generalization in neural\nnetworks to detection of out-of-distribution data, adversarial examples, and\nAI-generated text. The recent successes of deep generative models present an\nopportunity to leverage them for LID estimation, but current methods based on\ngenerative models produce inaccurate estimates, require more than a single\npre-trained model, are computationally intensive, or do not exploit the best\navailable deep generative models: diffusion models (DMs). In this work, we show\nthat the Fokker-Planck equation associated with a DM can provide an LID\nestimator which addresses the aforementioned deficiencies. Our estimator,\ncalled FLIPD, is easy to implement and compatible with all popular DMs.\nApplying FLIPD to synthetic LID estimation benchmarks, we find that DMs\nimplemented as fully-connected networks are highly effective LID estimators\nthat outperform existing baselines. We also apply FLIPD to natural images where\nthe true LID is unknown. Despite being sensitive to the choice of network\narchitecture, FLIPD estimates remain a useful measure of relative complexity;\ncompared to competing estimators, FLIPD exhibits a consistently higher\ncorrelation with image PNG compression rate and better aligns with qualitative\nassessments of complexity. Notably, FLIPD is orders of magnitude faster than\nother LID estimators, and the first to be tractable at the scale of Stable\nDiffusion.",

In this paper, we\npresent Wings, a novel MLLM that excels in both text-only dialogues and\nmultimodal comprehension. Analyzing MLLM attention in multimodal instructions\nreveals that text-only forgetting is related to the attention shifts from\npre-image to post-image text. From that, we construct extra modules that act as\nthe boosted learner to compensate for the attention shift. The complementary\nvisual and textual learners, like \"wings\" on either side, are connected in\nparallel within each layer's attention block. Initially, image and text inputs\nare aligned with visual learners operating alongside the main attention,\nbalancing focus on visual elements. Textual learners are later collaboratively\nintegrated with attention-based routing to blend the outputs of the visual and\ntextual learners. We design the Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA) to\nguarantee high efficiency for learners. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat Wings outperforms equally-scaled MLLMs in both text-only and visual\nquestion-answering tasks. On a newly constructed Interleaved Image-Text (IIT)\nbenchmark, Wings exhibits superior performance from text-only-rich to\nmultimodal-rich question-answering tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in internet-scale video data pretraining have led to the\ndevelopment of text-to-video generative models that can create high-quality\nvideos across a broad range of visual concepts, synthesize realistic motions\nand render complex objects. Hence, these generative models have the potential\nto become general-purpose simulators of the physical world. However, it is\nunclear how far we are from this goal with the existing text-to-video\ngenerative models. To this end, we present VideoPhy, a benchmark designed to\nassess whether the generated videos follow physical commonsense for real-world\nactivities (e.g. marbles will roll down when placed on a slanted surface).\nSpecifically, we curate diverse prompts that involve interactions between\nvarious material types in the physical world (e.g., solid-solid, solid-fluid,\nfluid-fluid). We then generate videos conditioned on these captions from\ndiverse state-of-the-art text-to-video generative models, including open models\n(e.g., CogVideoX) and closed models (e.g., Lumiere, Dream Machine). Our human\nevaluation reveals that the existing models severely lack the ability to\ngenerate videos adhering to the given text prompts, while also lack physical\ncommonsense. Specifically, the best performing model, CogVideoX-5B, generates\nvideos that adhere to the caption and physical laws for 39.6% of the instances.\nVideoPhy thus highlights that the video generative models are far from\naccurately simulating the physical world. Finally, we propose an\nauto-evaluator, VideoCon-Physics, to assess the performance reliably for the\nnewly released models.",

While prior work has evaluated LLMs\nextensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue summarization has\nfocused on BART-based models, leaving a gap in our understanding of their\nfaithfulness. Our work benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue\nsummarization, using human annotations and focusing on identifying and\ncategorizing span-level inconsistencies. Specifically, we focus on two\nprominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to\nwhat constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible inferences,\nsupported by circumstantial evidence in the conversation, that lack direct\nevidence, a pattern that is less prevalent in older models. We propose a\nrefined taxonomy of errors, coining the category of \"Circumstantial Inference\"\nto bucket these LLM behaviors and release the dataset. Using our taxonomy, we\ncompare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models.\nAdditionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error\ndetection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these\nnuanced errors. To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for\nfine-grained error detection that outperform existing metrics, particularly for\nidentifying \"Circumstantial Inference.\"",

    "abstract": "Serving LLMs requires substantial memory due to the storage requirements of\nKey-Value (KV) embeddings in the KV cache, which grows with sequence length. An\neffective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional\nquantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store\nquantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision\nper data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits\nper quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that\nconsists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit\nquantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads\nby removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an\nasymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that\napplying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to\nthe other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have\ndeveloped an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding\ninner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized\ncomputation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV\ncache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV\ncache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster\nruntime.

    "abstract": "Background: Structured radiology reports remains underdeveloped due to\nlabor-intensive structuring and narrative-style reporting. Deep learning,\nparticularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, offers promise in\nautomating the structuring of radiology reports in natural languages. However,\nalthough it has been reported that LLMs are less effective in languages other\nthan English, their radiological performance has not been extensively studied.\nPurpose: This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of TNM classification\nbased on radiology reports using GPT3.5-turbo (GPT3.5) and the utility of\nmultilingual LLMs in both Japanese and English. Material and Methods: Utilizing\nGPT3.5, we developed a system to automatically generate TNM classifications\nfrom chest CT reports for lung cancer and evaluate its performance. We\nstatistically analyzed the impact of providing full or partial TNM definitions\nin both languages using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Results: Highest\naccuracy was attained with full TNM definitions and radiology reports in\nEnglish (M = 94%, N = 80%, T = 47%, and ALL = 36%). Providing definitions for\neach of the T, N, and M factors statistically improved their respective\naccuracies (T: odds ratio (OR) = 2.35, p < 0.001; N: OR = 1.94, p < 0.01; M: OR\n= 2.50, p < 0.001). Japanese reports exhibited decreased N and M accuracies (N\naccuracy: OR = 0.74 and M accuracy: OR = 0.21). Conclusion: This study\nunderscores the potential of multilingual LLMs for automatic TNM classification\nin radiology reports. Even without additional model training, performance\nimprovements were evident with the provided TNM definitions, indicating LLMs'\nrelevance in radiology contexts.",

    "abstract": "Depth maps produced by consumer-grade sensors suffer from inaccurate\nmeasurements and missing data from either system or scene-specific sources.\nData-driven denoising algorithms can mitigate such problems. However, they\nrequire vast amounts of ground truth depth data. Recent research has tackled\nthis limitation using self-supervised learning techniques, but it requires\nmultiple RGB-D sensors. Moreover, most existing approaches focus on denoising\nsingle isolated depth maps or specific subjects of interest, highlighting a\nneed for methods to effectively denoise depth maps in real-time dynamic\nenvironments. This paper extends state-of-the-art approaches for\ndepth-denoising commodity depth devices, proposing SelfReDepth, a\nself-supervised deep learning technique for depth restoration, via denoising\nand hole-filling by inpainting full-depth maps captured with RGB-D sensors. The\nalgorithm targets depth data in video streams, utilizing multiple sequential\ndepth frames coupled with color data to achieve high-quality depth videos with\ntemporal coherence. Finally, SelfReDepth is designed to be compatible with\nvarious RGB-D sensors and usable in real-time scenarios as a pre-processing\nstep before applying other depth-dependent algorithms. Our results demonstrate\nour approach's real-time performance on real-world datasets. They show that it\noutperforms state-of-the-art denoising and restoration performance at over\n30fps on Commercial Depth Cameras, with potential benefits for augmented and\nmixed-reality applications.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of Large language models (LLMs), their\nremarkable capabilities remain limited to a few high-resource languages.\nAdditionally, many low-resource languages (\\eg African languages) are often\nevaluated only on basic text classification tasks due to the lack of\nappropriate or comprehensive benchmarks outside of high-resource languages. In\nthis paper, we introduce IrokoBench -- a human-translated benchmark dataset for\n17 typologically-diverse low-resource African languages covering three tasks:\nnatural language inference~(AfriXNLI), mathematical reasoning~(AfriMGSM), and\nmulti-choice knowledge-based question answering~(AfriMMLU). We use IrokoBench\nto evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and translate-test settings~(where test sets\nare translated into English) across 10 open and six proprietary LLMs. Our\nevaluation reveals a significant performance gap between high-resource\nlanguages~(such as English and French) and low-resource African languages. We\nobserve a significant performance gap between open and proprietary models, with\nthe highest performing open model, Gemma 2 27B only at 63\\% of the\nbest-performing proprietary model GPT-4o performance. In addition, machine\ntranslating the test set to English before evaluation helped to close the gap\nfor larger models that are English-centric, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1\n70B.

However, despite\nsignificant efforts in recent years, algorithmic advances in this direction\nhave been limited. In this work, we seek to understand the fundamental\ndifficulty of out-of-distribution generalization with deep neural networks. We\nfirst empirically show that perhaps surprisingly, even allowing a neural\nnetwork to explicitly fit the representations obtained from a teacher network\nthat can generalize out-of-distribution is insufficient for the generalization\nof the student network. Then, by a theoretical study of two-layer ReLU networks\noptimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under a structured feature\nmodel, we identify a fundamental yet unexplored feature learning proclivity of\nneural networks, feature contamination: neural networks can learn uncorrelated\nfeatures together with predictive features, resulting in generalization failure\nunder distribution shifts. Notably, this mechanism essentially differs from the\nprevailing narrative in the literature that attributes the generalization\nfailure to spurious correlations. Overall, our results offer new insights into\nthe non-linear feature learning dynamics of neural networks and highlight the\nnecessity of considering inductive biases in out-of-distribution\ngeneralization.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant\ncopyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers.\nNotably, generative AI's capacity for generating images of copyrighted\ncharacters has been well documented in the literature, and while various\ntechniques for mitigating copyright issues have been studied, significant risks\nremain. Here, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a\ngenerative model to make them more generic and less likely to imitate\ndistinctive features of copyrighted materials. To achieve this, we introduce a\nmetric for quantifying the level of originality of data, estimated by drawing\nsamples from a generative model, and applied in the genericization process. As\na practical implementation, we introduce PREGen (Prompt Rewriting-Enhanced\nGenericization), which combines our genericization method with an existing\nmitigation technique. Compared to the existing method, PREGen reduces the\nlikelihood of generating copyrighted characters by more than half when the\nnames of copyrighted characters are used as the prompt. Additionally, while\ngenerative models can produce copyrighted characters even when their names are\nnot directly mentioned in the prompt, PREGen almost entirely prevents the\ngeneration of such characters in these cases.

It achieves a similar\nclassification performance to ACM, which is typically better than -- or at\nworse comparable to -- state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ncode generation tasks. However, repository-level code generation presents\nunique challenges, particularly due to the need to utilize information spread\nacross multiple files within a repository. Existing retrieval-based approaches\nsometimes fall short as they are limited in obtaining a broader and deeper\nrepository context. In this paper, we present CatCoder, a novel code generation\nframework designed for statically typed programming languages. CatCoder\nenhances repository-level code generation by integrating relevant code and type\ncontext. Specifically, it leverages static analyzers to extract type\ndependencies and merges this information with retrieved code to create\ncomprehensive prompts for LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of CatCoder, we\nadapt and construct benchmarks that include 199 Java tasks and 90 Rust tasks.\nThe results show that CatCoder outperforms the RepoCoder baseline by up to\n17.35%, in terms of pass@k score. Furthermore, the generalizability of CatCoder\nis assessed using various LLMs, including both code-specialized models and\ngeneral-purpose models. Our findings indicate consistent performance\nimprovements across all models, which underlines the practicality of CatCoder.",

    "abstract": "Deep model fusion is an emerging technique that unifies the predictions or\nparameters of several deep neural networks into a single model in a\ncost-effective and data-efficient manner. This enables the unified model to\ntake advantage of the original models' strengths, potentially exceeding their\nperformance. Although a variety of deep model fusion techniques have been\nintroduced, their evaluations tend to be inconsistent and often inadequate to\nvalidate their effectiveness and robustness against distribution shifts. To\naddress this issue, we introduce FusionBench, which is the first comprehensive\nbenchmark dedicated to deep model fusion. FusionBench covers a wide range of\ntasks, including open-vocabulary image classification, text classification, and\ntext-to-text generation. Each category includes up to eight tasks with\ncorresponding task-specific models, featuring both full fine-tuning and LoRA\nfine-tuning, as well as models of different sizes, to ensure fair and balanced\ncomparisons of various multi-task model fusion techniques across different\ntasks, model scales, and fine-tuning strategies. We implement and evaluate a\nbroad spectrum of deep model fusion techniques. These techniques range from\nmodel ensemble methods, which combine the predictions to improve the overall\nperformance, to model merging, which integrates different models into a single\none, and model mixing methods, which upscale or recombine the components of the\noriginal models. FusionBench now contains 26 distinct tasks, 74 fine-tuned\nmodels, and 16 fusion techniques, and we are committed to consistently\nexpanding the benchmark with more tasks, models, and fusion techniques. In\naddition, we offer a well-documented set of resources and guidelines to aid\nresearchers in understanding and replicating the benchmark results.

We introduce HesScale, an\nimprovement over BL89, which adds negligible extra computation. On small\nnetworks, we find that this improvement is of higher quality than all\nalternatives, even those with theoretical guarantees, such as unbiasedness,\nwhile being much cheaper to compute. We use this insight in reinforcement\nlearning problems where small networks are used and demonstrate HesScale in\nsecond-order optimization and scaling the step-size parameter. In our\nexperiments, HesScale optimizes faster than existing methods and improves\nstability through step-size scaling.

This task is required in many speech-processing applications,\nsuch as rich meeting transcription. In this context, distant microphone arrays\nusually capture the audio signal. Beamforming, i.e., spatial filtering, is a\ncommon practice to process multi-microphone audio data. However, it often\nrequires an explicit localization of the active source to steer the filter.\nThis paper proposes a self-attention-based algorithm to select the output of a\nbank of fixed spatial filters. This method serves as a feature extractor for\njoint Voice Activity (VAD) and Overlapped Speech Detection (OSD). The speaker\ndiarization is then inferred from the detected segments. The approach shows\nconvincing distant VAD, OSD, and SD performance, e.g. 14.5% DER on the\nAISHELL-4 dataset. The analysis of the self-attention weights demonstrates\ntheir explainability, as they correlate with the speaker's angular locations.",

Existing methods do not provide explicit semantic\nconstrain for the feature extractor, hindering the agent from learning a\nunified cross-domain representation and resulting in performance degradation on\nunseen domains. Besides, abundant data from multiple domains are needed. To\naddress these issues, in this work, we propose prompt-based visual alignment\n(PVA), a robust framework to mitigate the detrimental domain bias in the image\nfor zero-shot policy transfer. Inspired that Visual-Language Model (VLM) can\nserve as a bridge to connect both text space and image space, we leverage the\nsemantic information contained in a text sequence as an explicit constraint to\ntrain a visual aligner. Thus, the visual aligner can map images from multiple\ndomains to a unified domain and achieve good generalization performance. To\nbetter depict semantic information, prompt tuning is applied to learn a\nsequence of learnable tokens. With explicit constraints of semantic\ninformation, PVA can learn unified cross-domain representation under limited\naccess to cross-domain data and achieves great zero-shot generalization ability\nin unseen domains. We verify PVA on a vision-based autonomous driving task with\nCARLA simulator. Experiments show that the agent generalizes well on unseen\ndomains under limited access to multi-domain data.",

Recent advances in speech\ntechnology and natural language processing allow for the creation of novel\ntools to practice their speaking skills. In this work, we tackle the first\ncomponent of such a pipeline, namely, the automated speech recognition module\n(ASR), which faces a number of challenges: first, state-of-the-art ASR models\nare often trained on adult read-aloud data by native speakers and do not\ntransfer well to young language learners' speech. Second, most ASR systems\ncontain a powerful language model, which smooths out errors made by the\nspeakers. To give corrective feedback, which is a crucial part of language\nlearning, the ASR systems in our setting need to preserve the errors made by\nthe language learners. In this work, we build an ASR system that satisfies\nthese requirements: it works on spontaneous speech by young language learners\nand preserves their errors. For this, we collected a corpus containing around\n85 hours of English audio spoken by learners in Switzerland from grades 4 to 6\non different language learning tasks, which we used to train an ASR model.

We also detail extensive\ntesting across over 64 scenarios involving two transformer models (DINO-DETR\nand Lite-DETR) and two CNN models (YOLOv3 and SSD) using three datasets,\ntotalling approximately 3.3 million inferences, to assess model robustness\ncomprehensively. Moreover, the paper explores unique aspects of attention\nblocks in transformers and their operational differences from CNNs.",

    "abstract": "Prior research demonstrates that Open AI's GPT models can predict variations\nin moral opinions between countries but that the accuracy tends to be\nsubstantially higher among high-income countries compared to low-income ones.\nThis study aims to replicate previous findings and advance the research by\nexamining how accuracy varies with different types of moral questions. Using\nresponses from the World Value Survey and the European Value Study, covering 18\nmoral issues across 63 countries, we calculated country-level mean scores for\neach moral issue and compared them with GPT-4's predictions. Confirming\nprevious findings, our results show that GPT-4 has greater predictive success\nin high-income than in low-income countries. However, our factor analysis\nreveals that GPT-4 bases its predictions primarily on a single dimension,\npresumably reflecting countries' degree of conservatism/liberalism. Conversely,\nthe real-world moral landscape appears to be two-dimensional, differentiating\nbetween personal-sexual and violent-dishonest issues. When moral issues are\ncategorized based on their moral domain, GPT-4's predictions are found to be\nremarkably accurate in the personal-sexual domain, across both high-income (r =\n.77) and low-income (r = .58) countries. Yet the predictive accuracy\nsignificantly drops in the violent-dishonest domain for both high-income (r =\n.30) and low-income (r = -.16) countries, indicating that GPT-4's\none-dimensional world-view does not fully capture the complexity of the moral\nlandscape. In sum, this study underscores the importance of not only\nconsidering country-specific characteristics to understand GPT-4's moral\nunderstanding, but also the characteristics of the moral issues at hand.",

Bayesian Causal Discovery (BCD) offers a principled approach to\nencapsulating this uncertainty. Unlike non-Bayesian causal discovery, which\nrelies on a single estimated causal graph and model parameters for assessment,\nevaluating BCD presents challenges due to the nature of its inferred quantity -\nthe posterior distribution. As a result, the research community has proposed\nvarious metrics to assess the quality of the approximate posterior. However,\nthere is, to date, no consensus on the most suitable metric(s) for evaluation.\nIn this work, we reexamine this question by dissecting various metrics and\nunderstanding their limitations. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we\nfind that many existing metrics fail to exhibit a strong correlation with the\nquality of approximation to the true posterior, especially in scenarios with\nlow sample sizes where BCD is most desirable. We highlight the suitability (or\nlack thereof) of these metrics under two distinct factors: the identifiability\nof the underlying causal model and the quantity of available data. Both factors\naffect the entropy of the true posterior, indicating that the current metrics\nare less fitting in settings of higher entropy. Our findings underline the\nimportance of a more nuanced evaluation of new methods by taking into account\nthe nature of the true posterior, as well as guide and motivate the development\nof new evaluation procedures for this challenge.",

The recent\nliterature on uncertainty quantification of natural language generation (NLG)\nutilises a conventional natural language inference (NLI) classifier to measure\nthe semantic dispersion of LLMs responses. These studies employ logits of NLI\nclassifier for semantic clustering to estimate uncertainty. However, logits\nrepresent the probability of the predicted class and barely contain feature\ninformation for potential clustering. Alternatively, CLIP (Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training) performs impressively in extracting image-text\npair features and measuring their similarity.

Our\nkey observation is that the existence of low-rank decompositions within the\ngradient computation of LoRA adaptation leads to possible algorithmic speedup.\nThis allows us to (i) identify a phase transition behavior and (ii) prove the\nexistence of nearly linear algorithms by controlling the LoRA update\ncomputation term by term, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis\n(SETH). For the former, we identify a sharp transition in the efficiency of all\npossible rank-$r$ LoRA update algorithms for transformers, based on specific\nnorms resulting from the multiplications of the input sequence $\\mathbf{X}$,\npretrained weights $\\mathbf{W^\\star}$, and adapter matrices $\\alpha \\mathbf{B}\n\\mathbf{A} / r$.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively employed in node\nclassification. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that GNNs are vulnerable\nto topological perturbations, such as adversarial attacks and edge disruptions.\nConsiderable efforts have been devoted to mitigating these challenges. For\nexample, pioneering Bayesian methodologies, including GraphSS and LlnDT,\nincorporate Bayesian label transitions and topology-based label sampling to\nstrengthen the robustness of GNNs. However, GraphSS is hindered by slow\nconvergence, while LlnDT faces challenges in sparse graphs. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel label inference framework, TraTopo, which\ncombines topology-driven label propagation, Bayesian label transitions, and\nlink analysis via random walks. TraTopo significantly surpasses its\npredecessors on sparse graphs by utilizing random walk sampling, specifically\ntargeting isolated nodes for link prediction, thus enhancing its effectiveness\nin topological sampling contexts. Additionally, TraTopo employs a shortest-path\nstrategy to refine link prediction, thereby reducing predictive overhead and\nimproving label inference accuracy. Empirical evaluations highlight TraTopo's\nsuperiority in node classification, significantly exceeding contemporary GCN\nmodels in accuracy.",

Maximizing plan flexibility has been studied\nthrough the notions of plan deordering, and plan reordering.

This study, in contrast\nwith traditional plan deordering and reordering strategies, improves a plan's\nflexibility by substituting its subplans with actions outside the plan for a\nplanning problem. We exploit block deordering, which eliminates orderings in a\nPOP by encapsulating coherent actions in blocks, to construct action blocks as\ncandidate subplans for substitutions. In addition, this paper introduces a\npruning technique for eliminating redundant actions within a BDPO plan. We also\nevaluate our approach when combined with MaxSAT-based reorderings.

Given the high costs and extensive\ntime commitments required for user studies, many researchers have turned\ntowards employing large multi-modal models (LMMs) as AIGI evaluators, the\nprecision and validity of which are still questionable. Furthermore,\ntraditional benchmarks often utilize mostly natural-captured content rather\nthan AIGIs to test the abilities of LMMs, leading to a noticeable gap for\nAIGIs. Therefore, we introduce A-Bench in this paper, a benchmark designed to\ndiagnose whether LMMs are masters at evaluating AIGIs. Specifically, A-Bench is\norganized under two key principles: 1) Emphasizing both high-level semantic\nunderstanding and low-level visual quality perception to address the intricate\ndemands of AIGIs. 2) Various generative models are utilized for AIGI creation,\nand various LMMs are employed for evaluation, which ensures a comprehensive\nvalidation scope. Ultimately, 2,864 AIGIs from 16 text-to-image models are\nsampled, each paired with question-answers annotated by human experts, and\ntested across 18 leading LMMs. We hope that A-Bench will significantly enhance\nthe evaluation process and promote the generation quality for AIGIs.

To improve sample efficiency, methods like\nReinforcement Learning from Expert Demonstrations (RLED) introduce external\nexpert demonstrations to facilitate agent exploration during the learning\nprocess. In practice, these demonstrations, which are often collected from\nhuman users, are costly and hence often constrained to a limited amount. How to\nselect the best set of human demonstrations that is most beneficial for\nlearning therefore becomes a major concern. This paper presents EARLY (Episodic\nActive Learning from demonstration querY), an algorithm that enables a learning\nagent to generate optimized queries of expert demonstrations in a\ntrajectory-based feature space. Based on a trajectory-level estimate of\nuncertainty in the agent's current policy, EARLY determines the optimized\ntiming and content for feature-based queries. By querying episodic\ndemonstrations as opposed to isolated state-action pairs, EARLY improves the\nhuman teaching experience and achieves better learning performance. We validate\nthe effectiveness of our method in three simulated navigation tasks of\nincreasing difficulty. The results show that our method is able to achieve\nexpert-level performance for all three tasks with convergence over 30\\% faster\nthan other baseline methods when demonstrations are generated by simulated\noracle policies. The results of a follow-up pilot user study (N=18) further\nvalidate that our method can still maintain a significantly better convergence\nin the case of human expert demonstrators while achieving a better user\nexperience in perceived task load and consuming significantly less human time.",

Downstream tasks built on top of those\npre-trained encoders can achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance. The\npre-trained encoders by SSL, however, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks as\ndemonstrated by existing studies. Numerous backdoor mitigation techniques are\ndesigned for downstream task models. However, their effectiveness is impaired\nand limited when adapted to pre-trained encoders, due to the lack of label\ninformation when pre-training. To address backdoor attacks against pre-trained\nencoders, in this paper, we innovatively propose a mutual information guided\nbackdoor mitigation technique, named MIMIC. MIMIC treats the potentially\nbackdoored encoder as the teacher net and employs knowledge distillation to\ndistill a clean student encoder from the teacher net. Different from existing\nknowledge distillation approaches, MIMIC initializes the student with random\nweights, inheriting no backdoors from teacher nets. Then MIMIC leverages mutual\ninformation between each layer and extracted features to locate where benign\nknowledge lies in the teacher net, with which distillation is deployed to clone\nclean features from teacher to student. We craft the distillation loss with two\naspects, including clone loss and attention loss, aiming to mitigate backdoors\nand maintain encoder performance at the same time. Our evaluation conducted on\ntwo backdoor attacks in SSL demonstrates that MIMIC can significantly reduce\nthe attack success rate by only utilizing <5% of clean data, surpassing seven\nstate-of-the-art backdoor mitigation techniques.",

We delve into biases\nrelated to option order and token usage, which significantly impact LLMs'\ndecision-making processes. We also quantify the impact of these biases through\nan extensive empirical analysis across multiple models and tasks. Furthermore,\nwe propose mitigation strategies to enhance model performance. Our key\ncontributions are threefold: 1) Precisely quantifying the influence of option\norder and token on LLMs, 2) Developing strategies to mitigate the impact of\ntoken and order sensitivity to enhance robustness, and 3) Offering a detailed\nanalysis of sensitivity across models and tasks, which informs the creation of\nmore stable and reliable LLM applications for selection problems.",

Our approach first constructs N parallel filters\ncorresponding to each of the $N$ individual LLMs. Each filter proposes its best\ncombination of LLMs, given the information that they have access to.\nSubsequently, the N filter outputs are optimally aggregated to maximize their\nrobust predictive power, and this update is computed efficiently via a\nclosed-form expression, generating our ensemble predictor. Our contributions\nare: **(I)** the MoE-F plug-and-play filtering harness algorithm, **(II)**\ntheoretical optimality guarantees of the proposed filtering-based gating\nalgorithm (via optimality guarantees for its parallel Bayesian filtering and\nits robust aggregation steps), and **(III)** empirical evaluation and ablative\nresults using state-of-the-art foundational and MoE LLMs on a real-world\n__Financial Market Movement__ task where MoE-F attains a remarkable 17\\%\nabsolute and 48.5\\% relative F1 measure improvement over the next best\nperforming individual LLM expert predicting short-horizon market movement based\non streaming news. Further, we provide empirical evidence of substantial\nperformance gains in applying MoE-F over specialized models in the long-horizon\ntime-series forecasting domain.",

It further\nsuggests strategies for local and global stakeholders to mitigate these\neffects. Our discussions demonstrated that GenAI can foster cultural\nimperialism by generating content that primarily incorporates cultural\nreferences and examples relevant to Western students, thereby alienating\nstudents from non-Western backgrounds. Also, the predominant use of Western\nlanguages by GenAI can marginalize non-dominant languages, making educational\ncontent less accessible to speakers of indigenous languages and potentially\nimpacting their ability to learn in their first language. Additionally, GenAI\noften generates content and curricula that reflect the perspectives of\ntechnologically dominant countries, overshadowing marginalized indigenous\nknowledge and practices. Moreover, the cost of access to GenAI intensifies\neducational inequality and the control of GenAI data could lead to commercial\nexploitation without benefiting local students and their communities. We\npropose human-centric reforms to prioritize cultural diversity and equity in\nGenAI development; a liberatory design to empower educators and students to\nidentify and dismantle the oppressive structures within GenAI applications;\nforesight by design to create an adjustable GenAI system to meet future\neducational needs; and finally, effective prompting skills to reduce the\nretrieval of neocolonial outputs.",

Despite this, on-device\ntraining has several drawbacks: (1) most user devices are too small to train\nlarge models on-device, (2) on-device training is communication- and\ncomputation-intensive, and (3) on-device training can be difficult to debug and\ndeploy. To address these problems, we propose Private Evolution-Text\n(PrE-Text), a method for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic\ntextual data. First, we show that across multiple datasets, training small\nmodels (models that fit on user devices) with PrE-Text synthetic data\noutperforms small models trained on-device under practical privacy regimes\n($\\epsilon=1.29$, $\\epsilon=7.58$). We achieve these results while using\n9$\\times$ fewer rounds, 6$\\times$ less client computation per round, and\n100$\\times$ less communication per round. Second, finetuning large models on\nPrE-Text's DP synthetic data improves large language model (LLM) performance on\nprivate data across the same range of privacy budgets. Altogether, these\nresults suggest that training on DP synthetic data can be a better option than\ntraining a model on-device on private distributed data.

Through a case\nstudy encompassing three domains (i.e., two single-task domains and one\nmulti-task domain), we demonstrate how to customize the LLM prompts (e.g.,\nomitting system utterances or speaker labels) for those three domains and\ncharacterize the generated task-oriented queries.

In addition, the integration of distributed energy\nresources (DERs) such as wind and solar generations increases the complexities\nand nonlinear nature of power systems. Therefore, an interpretable and reliable\nmethodology is of utmost need to increase the confidence of power system\noperators and their situational awareness for making reliable decisions. This\nhas led to the development of physics-informed neural network (PINN) models as\nmore interpretable, trustworthy, and robust models where the underlying\nprincipled laws are integrated into the training process of neural network\nmodels to achieve improved performance. This paper proposes a multivariate\nphysics-informed convolutional autoencoder (PIConvAE) model to detect cyber\nanomalies in power distribution systems with unbalanced configurations and high\npenetration of DERs. The physical laws are integrated through a customized loss\nfunction that embeds the underlying Kirchhoff's circuit laws into the training\nprocess of the autoencoder. The performance of the multivariate PIConvAE model\nis evaluated on two unbalanced power distribution grids, IEEE 123-bus system\nand a real-world feeder in Riverside, CA. The results show the exceptional\nperformance of the proposed method in detecting various cyber anomalies in both\nsystems. In addition, the model's effectiveness is evaluated in data scarcity\nscenarios with different training data ratios.

In the classical RLHF framework, a reward model is first\ntrained to represent human preferences, which is in turn used by an online\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize the LLM. A prominent issue\nwith such methods is reward over-optimization or reward hacking, where\nperformance as measured by the learned proxy reward model increases, but true\nquality plateaus or even deteriorates. Direct Alignment Algorithms (DDAs) like\nDirect Preference Optimization have emerged as alternatives to the classical\nRLHF pipeline by circumventing the reward modeling phase. However, although\nDAAs do not use a separate proxy reward model, they still commonly deteriorate\nfrom over-optimization. While the so-called reward hacking phenomenon is not\nwell-defined for DAAs, we still uncover similar trends: at higher KL budgets,\nDAA algorithms exhibit similar degradation patterns to their classic RLHF\ncounterparts. In particular, we find that DAA methods deteriorate not only\nacross a wide range of KL budgets but also often before even a single epoch of\nthe dataset is completed.

Testing\ncombinations of fine-tuning and model sizes on a benchmark dataset of five 3D\nSlicer questions revealed that fine-tuning had no impact on model performance\nor speed compared to the base architecture, and that larger models performed\nbetter with a significant speed decrease. Experiments with adding 3D Slicer\ndocumentation to the prompt showed that Python sample code and Markdown\ndocumentation were the most useful information to include, but that adding 3D\nSlicer scene data and questions taken from Discourse also improved model\nperformance.

Despite the remarkable\nfew-shot capabilities exhibited by black-box large language models (LLMs), the\ninherent opacity of their model parameters presents significant challenges in\naligning the generated output with individual expectations. Existing solutions\nhave primarily focused on prompt design to incorporate user-specific profiles\nand behaviors; however, such approaches often struggle to generalize\neffectively due to their inability to capture shared knowledge among all users.\nTo address these challenges, we propose HYDRA, a model factorization framework\nthat captures both user-specific behavior patterns from historical data and\nshared general knowledge among all users to deliver personalized generation. In\norder to capture user-specific behavior patterns, we first train a reranker to\nprioritize the most useful information from top-retrieved relevant historical\nrecords. By combining the prioritized history with the corresponding query, we\ntrain an adapter to align the output with individual user-specific preferences,\neliminating the reliance on access to inherent model parameters of black-box\nLLMs. Both the reranker and the adapter can be decomposed into a base model\nwith multiple user-specific heads, resembling a hydra. The base model maintains\nshared knowledge across users, while the multiple personal heads capture\nuser-specific preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that HYDRA\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by an average\nrelative improvement of 9.01% across five diverse personalization tasks in the\nLaMP benchmark.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in\nvarious tasks, yet their vast parameter sizes restrict their applicability in\nresource-constrained settings. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a viable\nsolution by transferring expertise from large teacher models to compact student\nmodels. However, traditional KD techniques face specific challenges when\napplied to LLMs, including restricted access to LLM outputs, significant\nteacher-student capacity gaps, and the inherited mis-calibration issue. In this\nwork, we present PLaD, a novel preference-based LLM distillation framework.\nPLaD exploits the teacher-student capacity discrepancy to generate\npseudo-preference pairs where teacher outputs are preferred over student\noutputs. Then, PLaD leverages a ranking loss to re-calibrate student's\nestimation of sequence likelihood, which steers the student's focus towards\nunderstanding the relative quality of outputs instead of simply imitating the\nteacher. PLaD bypasses the need for access to teacher LLM's internal states,\ntackles the student's expressivity limitations, and mitigates the student\nmis-calibration issue. Through extensive experiments on two sequence generation\ntasks and with various LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nPLaD framework.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Knowledge Editing has received increasing attention, since it could\nupdate the specific knowledge from outdated ones in pretrained models without\nre-training. However, as pointed out by recent studies, existing related\nmethods tend to merely memorize the superficial word composition of the edited\nknowledge, rather than truly learning and absorbing it. Consequently, on the\nreasoning questions, we discover that existing methods struggle to utilize the\nedited knowledge to reason the new answer, and tend to retain outdated\nresponses, which are generated by the original models utilizing original\nknowledge. Nevertheless, the outdated responses are unexpected for the correct\nanswers to reasoning questions, which we named as the outdated issue. To\nalleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective decoding\nstrategy, i.e., outDated ISsue aware deCOding (DISCO), to enhance the\nperformance of edited models on reasoning questions. Specifically, we capture\nthe difference in the probability distribution between the original and edited\nmodels. Further, we amplify the difference of the token prediction in the\nedited model to alleviate the outdated issue, and thus enhance the model\nperformance w.r.t the edited knowledge. Experimental results suggest that\napplying DISCO could enhance edited models to reason, e.g., on reasoning\nquestions, DISCO outperforms the prior SOTA method by 12.99 F1 scores, and\nreduces the ratio of the outdated issue to 5.78% on the zsRE dataset.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual neural machine translation models generally distinguish\ntranslation directions by the language tag (LT) in front of the source or\ntarget sentences. However, current LT strategies cannot indicate the desired\ntarget language as expected on zero-shot translation, i.e., the off-target\nissue. Our analysis reveals that the indication of the target language is\nsensitive to the placement of the target LT. For example, when placing the\ntarget LT on the decoder side, the indication would rapidly degrade along with\ndecoding steps, while placing the target LT on the encoder side would lead to\ncopying or paraphrasing the source input. To address the above issues, we\npropose a simple yet effective strategy named Language Converter Strategy\n(LCS). By introducing the target language embedding into the top encoder\nlayers, LCS mitigates confusion in the encoder and ensures stable language\nindication for the decoder. Experimental results on MultiUN, TED, and OPUS-100\ndatasets demonstrate that LCS could significantly mitigate the off-target\nissue, with language accuracy up to 95.28%, 96.21%, and 85.35% meanwhile\noutperforming the vanilla LT strategy by 3.07, 3,3, and 7.93 BLEU scores on\nzero-shot translation, respectively.",

The core idea behind these methods is\nto represent a CO problem as a graph and then use GNNs to learn the node/graph\nembedding with combinatorial information. Although these methods have achieved\npromising results, given a specific CO problem, the design of GNN architectures\nstill requires heavy manual work with domain knowledge. Existing automated GNNs\nare mostly focused on traditional graph learning problems, which is\ninapplicable to solving NP-hard CO problems. To this end, we present a new\nclass of \\textbf{AUTO}mated \\textbf{G}NNs for solving \\textbf{NP}-hard\nproblems, namely \\textbf{AutoGNP}. We represent CO problems by GNNs and focus\non two specific problems, i.e., mixed integer linear programming and quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization. The idea of AutoGNP is to use graph neural\narchitecture search algorithms to automatically find the best GNNs for a given\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Compared with existing graph neural\narchitecture search algorithms, AutoGNP utilizes two-hop operators in the\narchitecture search space. Moreover, AutoGNP utilizes simulated annealing and a\nstrict early stopping policy to avoid local optimal solutions.

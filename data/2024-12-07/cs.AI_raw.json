    "abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of OpenAI's o1-preview model in\nhigher-order cognitive domains, including critical thinking, systematic\nthinking, computational thinking, data literacy, creative thinking, logical\nreasoning, and scientific reasoning. Using established benchmarks, we compared\nthe o1-preview models's performance to human participants from diverse\neducational levels. o1-preview achieved a mean score of 24.33 on the Ennis-Weir\nCritical Thinking Essay Test (EWCTET), surpassing undergraduate (13.8) and\npostgraduate (18.39) participants (z = 1.60 and 0.90, respectively). In\nsystematic thinking, it scored 46.1, SD = 4.12 on the Lake Urmia Vignette,\nsignificantly outperforming the human mean (20.08, SD = 8.13, z = 3.20). For\ndata literacy, o1-preview scored 8.60, SD = 0.70 on Merk et al.'s \"Use Data\"\ndimension, compared to the human post-test mean of 4.17, SD = 2.02 (z = 2.19).\nOn creative thinking tasks, the model achieved originality scores of 2.98, SD =\n0.73, higher than the human mean of 1.74 (z = 0.71). In logical reasoning\n(LogiQA), it outperformed humans with average 90%, SD = 10% accuracy versus\n86%, SD = 6.5% (z = 0.62). For scientific reasoning, it achieved near-perfect\nperformance (mean = 0.99, SD = 0.12) on the TOSLS,, exceeding the highest human\nscores of 0.85, SD = 0.13 (z = 1.78). While o1-preview excelled in structured\ntasks, it showed limitations in problem-solving and adaptive reasoning. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of AI to complement education in structured\nassessments but highlight the need for ethical oversight and refinement for\nbroader applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have discovered that LLMs have serious privacy leakage\nconcerns, where an LLM may be fooled into outputting private information under\ncarefully crafted adversarial prompts. These risks include leaking system\nprompts, personally identifiable information, training data, and model\nparameters. Most existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage rely on\nhumans to craft the adversarial prompts. A few automated methods are proposed\nfor system prompt extraction, but they cannot be applied to more severe risks\n(e.g., training data extraction) and have limited effectiveness even for system\nprompt extraction.\n  In this paper, we propose PrivAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework\nfor LLM privacy leakage. We formulate different risks as a search problem with\na unified attack goal. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through\nreinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for\ndifferent target models under different risks. We propose a novel reward\nfunction to provide effective and fine-grained rewards for the attack agent.\nFinally, we introduce customizations to better fit our general framework to\nsystem prompt extraction and training data extraction. Through extensive\nevaluations, we first show that PrivAgent outperforms existing automated\nmethods in system prompt leakage against six popular LLMs. Notably, our\napproach achieves a 100% success rate in extracting system prompts from\nreal-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We also show PrivAgent's\neffectiveness in extracting training data from an open-source LLM with a\nsuccess rate of 5.9%. We further demonstrate PrivAgent's effectiveness in\nevading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better\nsafety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a\ndetailed ablation study. We release our code here\nhttps://github.com/rucnyz/RedAgent.",

Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it\ndifficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and\nreasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by\nfocusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the\ncore capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such\nout-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern\nrecognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we\nintroduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason\nabout unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks\nartificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while\nquestioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual\ninformation that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate\na comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and\n6,700 yes/no questions, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating\nvarious state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as\nopen-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of\nup to 32% from humans on these tasks.

In this work, we propose a method for a completely\nunsupervised alternative to grounding language instructions in a zero-shot\nmanner to obtain policies. We present a solution that takes the form of\nimagine, project, and imitate: The agent imagines the observation sequence\ncorresponding to the language description of a task, projects the imagined\nsequence to our target domain, and grounds it to a policy. Video-language\nmodels allow us to imagine task descriptions that leverage knowledge of tasks\nlearned from internet-scale video-text mappings. The challenge remains to\nground these generations to a policy. In this work, we show that we can achieve\na zero-shot language-to-behavior policy by first grounding the imagined\nsequences in real observations of an unsupervised RL agent and using a\nclosed-form solution to imitation learning that allows the RL agent to mimic\nthe grounded observations. Our method, RLZero, is the first to our knowledge to\nshow zero-shot language to behavior generation abilities without any\nsupervision on a variety of tasks on simulated domains.

We formulate the constraint\nlearning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion\nplanner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By\nseparating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we\nimprove both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention\nto relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that\nrely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or\ninverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without\nsimulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world\nscenarios.

A comparative\nevaluation of various machine learning classification methods is conducted, to\nprecisely determine the average accuracy of each classifier on bot datasets\nlike CTU-13, ISOT 2010 and ISCX 2014. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning using\nGenetic Algorithm (GA), aiming to efficiently converge to the fittest\nhyperparameter set for each dataset was done. The bioinspired optimisation of\nRandom Forest (RF) with GA achieved an average accuracy of 99.85% when it was\ntested against the three datasets.

    "abstract": "Interpreting complex neural networks is crucial for understanding their\ndecision-making processes, particularly in applications where transparency and\naccountability are essential. This proposed method addresses this need by\nfocusing on layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique used in\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to attribute neural network outputs\nto input features through backpropagated relevance scores. Existing LRP methods\noften struggle with precision in evaluating individual neuron contributions. To\novercome this limitation, we present a novel approach that improves the parsing\nof selected neurons during LRP backward propagation, using the Visual Geometry\nGroup 16 (VGG16) architecture as a case study. Our method creates neural\nnetwork graphs to highlight critical paths and visualizes these paths with\nheatmaps, optimizing neuron selection through accuracy metrics like Mean\nSquared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).\nAdditionally, we utilize a deconvolutional visualization technique to\nreconstruct feature maps, offering a comprehensive view of the network's inner\nworkings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances\ninterpretability and supports the development of more transparent artificial\nintelligence (AI) systems for computer vision applications.

Its main challenges stem from the high variety\nof image captioning datasets, where differences in content can create a range\nof inconsistencies (\\eg, inconsistencies in scene, entities, entity attributes,\nentity numbers, entity interactions). Moreover, variations in caption length\ncan introduce inconsistencies at different levels of granularity as well. To\ntackle these challenges, we design an adaptive evaluation framework, called\nHierarchical and Multi-Grained Inconsistency Evaluation (HMGIE), which can\nprovide multi-grained evaluations covering both accuracy and completeness for\nvarious image-caption pairs. Specifically, the HMGIE framework is implemented\nby three consecutive modules. Firstly, the semantic graph generation module\nconverts the image caption to a semantic graph for building a structural\nrepresentation of all involved semantic items. Then, the hierarchical\ninconsistency evaluation module provides a progressive evaluation procedure\nwith a dynamic question-answer generation and evaluation strategy guided by the\nsemantic graph, producing a hierarchical inconsistency evaluation graph (HIEG).\nFinally, the quantitative evaluation module calculates the accuracy and\ncompleteness scores based on the HIEG, followed by a natural language\nexplanation about the detection results. Moreover, to verify the efficacy and\nflexibility of the proposed framework on handling different image captioning\ndatasets, we construct MVTID, an image-caption dataset with diverse types and\ngranularities of inconsistencies.

Neural networks have been\ntrained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy\nfor several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the\nbackpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is\noptimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the\nmanifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions\nmatching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of\nlocal minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization.

The search space is limited to the\ninstantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the\nbest solution.

We successfully achieved real-time inference at a rate of\napproximately 5Hz with a high accuracy of 0.91% F1 score, with only -0.2%\ndegradation compared to running the same model on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\nTi. This work demonstrates that effective real-time 3D object detection can be\nachieved on low-cost, low-power hardware, representing a significant step\ntowards more accessible autonomous driving technologies.

    "abstract": "The lack of ground truth explanation labels is a fundamental challenge for\nquantitative evaluation in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This\nchallenge becomes especially problematic when evaluation methods have numerous\nhyperparameters that must be specified by the user, as there is no ground truth\nto determine an optimal hyperparameter selection. It is typically not feasible\nto do an exhaustive search of hyperparameters so researchers typically make a\nnormative choice based on similar studies in the literature, which provides\ngreat flexibility for the user. In this work, we illustrate how this\nflexibility can be exploited to manipulate the evaluation outcome. We frame\nthis manipulation as an adversarial attack on the evaluation where seemingly\ninnocent changes in hyperparameter setting significantly influence the\nevaluation outcome. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our manipulation across\nseveral datasets with large changes in evaluation outcomes across several\nexplanation methods and models. Lastly, we propose a mitigation strategy based\non ranking across hyperparameters that aims to provide robustness towards such\nmanipulation. This work highlights the difficulty of conducting reliable XAI\nevaluation and emphasizes the importance of a holistic and transparent approach\nto evaluation in XAI.",

To address these\nchallenges and improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in\ngeospatial code generation tasks, we propose a framework for building a\ngeospatial operator knowledge base tailored to the GEE JavaScript API. This\nframework consists of an operator syntax knowledge table, an operator\nrelationship frequency table, an operator frequent pattern knowledge table, and\nan operator relationship chain knowledge table. By leveraging Abstract Syntax\nTree (AST) techniques and frequent itemset mining, we systematically extract\noperator knowledge from 185,236 real GEE scripts and syntax documentation,\nforming a structured knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nframework achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, and F1 score in operator\nknowledge extraction. When integrated with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) strategy for LLM-based geospatial code generation tasks, the knowledge\nbase improves performance by 20-30%. Ablation studies further quantify the\nnecessity of each knowledge table in the knowledge base construction.

Providing the visual attributes directly as textual\nprompts, which assumes an oracle visual perception module, allows us to measure\nthe model's abstract reasoning capability in isolation. Despite providing such\ncompositionally structured representations from the oracle visual perception\nand advanced prompting techniques, both GPT-4 and Llama-3 70B cannot achieve\nperfect accuracy on the center constellation of the I-RAVEN dataset. Our\nanalysis reveals that the root cause lies in the LLM's weakness in\nunderstanding and executing arithmetic rules. As a potential remedy, we analyze\nthe Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a neuro-symbolic\napproach that learns to reason with vector-symbolic architectures (VSAs). Here,\nconcepts are represented with distributed vectors s.t. dot products between\nencoded vectors define a similarity kernel, and simple element-wise operations\non the vectors perform addition/subtraction on the encoded values.

We find that the LLM's accuracy of\nsolving arithmetic rules drops to sub-10%, especially as the dynamic range\nexpands, while ARLC can maintain a high accuracy due to emulating symbolic\ncomputations on top of properly distributed representations.

Modern industrial measurement\nscenarios demand high precision, large image sizes, and high speed. However,\nconventional methods struggle with noise resistance and processing speed.\nCurrent deep learning methods are limited by the receptive field size and\nsparse semantic information, making them ineffective for large size images. To\naddress this issue, we propose a mutual self-distillation (MSD) mechanism and\nadaptive boosting ensemble segmenters to construct a universal multi-size phase\nunwrapping network (UMSPU). MSD performs hierarchical attention refinement and\nachieves cross-layer collaborative learning through bidirectional distillation,\nensuring fine-grained semantic representation across image sizes. The adaptive\nboosting ensemble segmenters combine weak segmenters with different receptive\nfields into a strong one, ensuring stable segmentation across spatial\nfrequencies. Experimental results show that UMSPU overcomes image size\nlimitations, achieving high precision across image sizes ranging from 256*256\nto 2048*2048 (an 8 times increase). It also outperforms existing methods in\nspeed, robustness, and generalization. Its practicality is further validated in\nstructured light imaging and InSAR.

    "abstract": "Urban flow prediction is a classic spatial-temporal forecasting task that\nestimates the amount of future traffic flow for a given location. Though models\nrepresented by Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have established\nthemselves as capable predictors, they tend to suffer from distribution shifts\nthat are common with the urban flow data due to the dynamics and\nunpredictability of spatial-temporal events. Unfortunately, in spatial-temporal\napplications, the dynamic environments can hardly be quantified via a fixed\nnumber of parameters, whereas learning time- and location-specific environments\ncan quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework named Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt learning (MIP) for urban\nflow prediction under constant distribution shifts. Specifically, MIP is\nequipped with a learnable memory bank that is trained to memorize the causal\nfeatures within the spatial-temporal graph. By querying a trainable memory bank\nthat stores the causal features, we adaptively extract invariant and variant\nprompts (i.e., patterns) for a given location at every time step. Then, instead\nof intervening the raw data based on simulated environments, we directly\nperform intervention on variant prompts across space and time. With the\nintervened variant prompts in place, we use invariant learning to minimize the\nvariance of predictions, so as to ensure that the predictions are only made\nwith invariant features. With extensive comparative experiments on two public\nurban flow datasets, we thoroughly demonstrate the robustness of MIP against\nOOD data.",

Recently, SNN-based\ntransformers have garnered significant interest, incorporating attention\nmechanisms akin to their counterparts in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)\nwhile demonstrating excellent performance. However, deploying large spiking\ntransformer models on resource-constrained edge devices such as mobile phones,\nstill poses significant challenges resulted from the high computational demands\nof large uncompressed high-precision models. In this work, we introduce a novel\nheterogeneous quantization method for compressing spiking transformers through\nlayer-wise quantization. Our approach optimizes the quantization of each layer\nusing one of two distinct quantization schemes, i.e., uniform or power-of-two\nquantification, with mixed bit resolutions. Our heterogeneous quantization\ndemonstrates the feasibility of maintaining high performance for spiking\ntransformers while utilizing an average effective resolution of 3.14-3.67 bits\nwith less than a 1% accuracy drop on DVS Gesture and CIFAR10-DVS datasets. It\nattains a model compression rate of 8.71x-10.19x for standard floating-point\nspiking transformers. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves a significant\nenergy reduction of 5.69x, 8.72x, and 10.2x while maintaining high accuracy\nlevels of 85.3%, 97.57%, and 80.4% on N-Caltech101, DVS-Gesture, and\nCIFAR10-DVS datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Alignment is a social phenomenon wherein individuals share a common goal or\nperspective. Mirroring, or mimicking the behaviors and opinions of another\nindividual, is one mechanism by which individuals can become aligned. Large\nscale investigations of the effect of mirroring on alignment have been limited\ndue to the scalability of traditional experimental designs in sociology. In\nthis paper, we introduce a simple computational framework that enables studying\nthe effect of mirroring behavior on alignment in multi-agent systems. We\nsimulate systems of interacting large language models in this framework and\ncharacterize overall system behavior and alignment with quantitative measures\nof agent dynamics. We find that system behavior is strongly influenced by the\nrange of communication of each agent and that these effects are exacerbated by\nincreased rates of mirroring. We discuss the observed simulated system behavior\nin the context of known human social dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Fake news on social media platforms poses a significant threat to societal\nsystems, underscoring the urgent need for advanced detection methods. The\nexisting detection methods can be divided into machine intelligence-based,\ncrowd intelligence-based, and hybrid intelligence-based methods. Among them,\nhybrid intelligence-based methods achieve the best performance but fail to\nconsider the reliability issue in detection. In light of this, we propose a\nnovel Reliability Aware Hybrid Intelligence (RAHI) method for fake news\ndetection. Our method comprises three integral modules. The first module\nemploys a Bayesian deep learning model to capture the inherent reliability\nwithin machine intelligence. The second module uses an Item Response Theory\n(IRT)-based user response aggregation to account for the reliability in crowd\nintelligence. The third module introduces a new distribution fusion mechanism,\nwhich takes the distributions derived from both machine and crowd intelligence\nas input, and outputs a fused distribution that provides predictions along with\nthe associated reliability. The experiments on the Weibo dataset demonstrate\nthe advantages of our method. This study contributes to the research field with\na novel RAHI-based method, and the code is shared at\nhttps://github.com/Kangwei-g/RAHI. This study has practical implications for\nthree key stakeholders: internet users, online platform managers, and the\ngovernment.",

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a research hotspot in both\nacademia and industry in recent years. Deep learning methods have become the\nmainstream research direction due to their excellent performance. However, new\nviewpoints have emerged in recent TSAD research. Deep learning is not required\nfor TSAD due to limitations such as slow deep learning speed. The Broad\nLearning System (BLS) is a shallow network framework that benefits from its\nease of optimization and speed. It has been shown to outperform machine\nlearning approaches while remaining competitive with deep learning. Based on\nthe current situation of TSAD, we propose the Contrastive Patch-based Broad\nLearning System (CPatchBLS). This is a new exploration of patching technique\nand BLS, providing a new perspective for TSAD. We construct Dual-PatchBLS as a\nbase through patching and Simple Kernel Perturbation (SKP) and utilize\ncontrastive learning to capture the differences between normal and abnormal\ndata under different representations. To compensate for the temporal semantic\nloss caused by various patching, we propose CPatchBLS with model level\nintegration, which takes advantage of BLS's fast feature to build model-level\nintegration and improve model detection. Using five real-world series anomaly\ndetection datasets, we confirmed the method's efficacy, outperforming previous\ndeep learning and machine learning methods while retaining a high level of\ncomputing efficiency.",

Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical\nscaling-assigning subtasks to specialized modules-and horizontal\nscaling-replicating tasks across multiple agents-to improve performance.\nHowever, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\nand Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among\nobjectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to\nspecific operational constraints.\n  In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG\ntailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications.

By imposing constraints on the structure of such\ncircuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting\nand most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing\nprobabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operators\nto derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic\nperspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries\n- including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and\ncausal backdoor adjustment - correspond to a combination of basic operators\nover semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this\nframework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable\ncomposition of these operators, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal\ndeterminism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings.\nApplying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such\ncompositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing\nproblems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel\ncompositional inference queries.",

To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted\nexperiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a\nsimple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load.

An\nexpert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling\n(GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI\nassistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep\nbaseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to\nsuccessfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to\ndevelop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation\nunderscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support\ndigital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work\nrequired to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.",

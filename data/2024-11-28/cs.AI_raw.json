    "abstract": "Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images\nin text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in\nrendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable\nDiffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text\ndepiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a\ntraining-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly\nenhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting\nsampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between\nover-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and\nreintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler\neffectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct\nthe compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the\ntext rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe\nover-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we\npropose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively\ncontrols the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their\nattention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9%\nimprovement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising\noverall image quality or increasing inference cost.

In this paper, we\npropose a zero-forget domain adaptation (ZFDA) framework to preserve SC\nalignment. To prevent the DA from changing substantial neural parameters of AI,\nwe design sparse additive modifications (SAM) to the parameters, which can be\nefficiently stored and switched-off to restore the SC alignment. To optimize\nthe SAM, we decouple it into tractable continuous variables and a binary mask,\nand then handle the binary mask by a score-based optimization. Experimental\nevaluations on a SC system for image transmissions validate that the proposed\nframework perfectly preserves the SC alignment with almost no loss of DA\nperformance, even improved in some cases, at a cost of less than 1% of\nadditional memory.",

    "abstract": "Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a\npromising paradigm for privacy-preserving and efficient adaptation of\nPre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in Federated Learning (FL) settings. It\npreserves data privacy by keeping the data decentralized and training the model\non local devices, ensuring that raw data never leaves the user's device.\nMoreover, the integration of PEFT methods such as LoRA significantly reduces\nthe number of trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the entire model,\nthereby minimizing communication costs and computational overhead. Despite its\npotential, the security implications of FedPEFT remain underexplored. This\npaper introduces a novel security threat to FedPEFT, termed PEFT-as-an-Attack\n(PaaA), which exposes how PEFT can be exploited as an attack vector to\ncircumvent PLMs' safety alignment and generate harmful content in response to\nmalicious prompts. Our evaluation of PaaA reveals that with less than 1% of the\nmodel's parameters set as trainable, and a small subset of clients acting\nmaliciously, the attack achieves an approximate 80% attack success rate using\nrepresentative PEFT methods such as LoRA. To mitigate this threat, we further\ninvestigate potential defense strategies, including Robust Aggregation Schemes\n(RASs) and Post-PEFT Safety Alignment (PPSA). However, our empirical analysis\nhighlights the limitations of these defenses, i.e., even the most advanced\nRASs, such as DnC and ClippedClustering, struggle to defend against PaaA in\nscenarios with highly heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, while PPSA\ncan reduce attack success rates to below 10%, it severely degrades the model's\naccuracy on the target task. Our results underscore the urgent need for more\neffective defense mechanisms that simultaneously ensure security and maintain\nthe performance of the FedPEFT paradigm.",

While existing\nvision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by\nleveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face\nchallenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and\ntext features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in\nfine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this\ngap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial\naccuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns\nthe textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a\nlearned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying\nbackbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to\nselectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that\nthe powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the\nsegmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations,\nand that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from\nthe background.

However, real-world\nscenarios often involve large-scale datasets and numerous constraints,\npresenting significant challenges.

The spectral reflectance of the different\nobjects in a driving scene beyond the visible spectrum can offer additional\ninformation to increase the reliability of these systems, especially under\nchallenging driving conditions. Furthermore, this information may be\nsignificant enough to develop vision systems that allow for a better\nunderstanding and interpretation of the whole driving scene.

To do this, we have used the HSI-Drive 1.1 dataset to perform\nvarious experiments on spectral classification algorithms. However, the\ninformation retrieval of hyperspectral recordings in natural outdoor scenarios\nis challenging, mainly because of deficient colour constancy and other inherent\nshortcomings of current snapshot HSI technology, which poses some limitations\nto the development of pure spectral classifiers. In consequence, in this work\nwe analyze to what extent the spatial features codified by standard, tiny fully\nconvolutional network (FCN) models can improve the performance of HSI\nsegmentation systems for ADAS applications.\n  The abstract above is truncated due to submission limits.

The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to\ntailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and\nnarrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was\nthe difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction\nbehaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative\nknowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational\ngoals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior,\nas the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and\ncontextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of\nrelying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly\nin nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this\nissue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the\nchatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In\nthe final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five\nconsecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions.

Such safety-constrained\ndecision processes are central to applications in autonomous systems, finance,\nand resource management, where policies must satisfy strict, state-dependent\nconstraints. We consider a doubly-regularized RL framework that combines reward\nand parameter regularization to address these constraints within continuous\nstate-action spaces. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a convex\nregularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Our\napproach leverages recent developments in mean-field theory and Wasserstein\ngradient flows to model policies as elements of an infinite-dimensional\nstatistical manifold, with policy updates evolving via gradient flows on the\nspace of parameter distributions. Our main contributions include establishing\nsolvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, defining smooth and\nbounded approximations that facilitate gradient flows, and demonstrating\nexponential convergence towards global solutions under sufficient\nregularization. We provide general conditions on regularization functions,\nencompassing standard entropy regularization as a special case. The results\nalso enable a particle method implementation for practical RL applications. The\ntheoretical insights and convergence guarantees presented here offer a robust\nframework for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional decision-making problems.",

    "abstract": "Real-world traffic involves diverse road users, ranging from pedestrians to\nheavy trucks, necessitating effective road user classification for various\napplications within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Traditional approaches\noften rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These\nsystems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these\nlimitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective\nalternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz)\npositional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging\npositioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only\nproposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor\napplications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on\npositional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global\nNavigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices.\nAs a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans,\ncyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used\nclassical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as\nthey repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN\narchitecture for road user classification, based on selected motion\ncharacteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the\ninfluence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The\nresults of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road\nusers on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types\nof motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.",

This\nallows information to diffuse across regions, yielding harmonious outcomes.\nHowever, the chaotic and disordered nature of information diffusion in\ndiffusion models often results in undesired interference between image regions,\ncausing degraded detail preservation and contextual inconsistency. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by reframing disordered diffusion as a\npowerful tool for text-vision-to-image generation (TV2I) tasks, achieving\npixel-level condition fidelity while maintaining visual and semantic coherence\nthroughout the image. We first introduce Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW), which\nprovides an efficient unidirectional diffusion framework for precise\ninformation transfer while minimizing disruptive interference. Building on COW,\nwe further propose Selective One-Way Diffusion (SOW), which utilizes Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) to clarify the semantic and spatial relationships\nwithin the image. Based on these insights, SOW combines attention mechanisms to\ndynamically regulate the direction and intensity of diffusion according to\ncontextual relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the untapped\npotential of controlled information diffusion, offering a path to more adaptive\nand versatile generative models in a learning-free manner.",

Our method avoids imposing\nadditional constraints during training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nthereby maximizing the learning of new classes. To integrate knowledge from old\nand new tasks, we propose two efficient post-processing modules. On the one\nhand, we retain only two sets of LoRA parameters for merging and propose\ndynamic representation consolidation to calibrate the merged feature\nrepresentation. On the other hand, we propose decision boundary refinement to\naddress classifier bias when training solely on new class data.

While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and\ndetermine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the\nreal-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite\ntheir importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent\nmodules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations.\nClassical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption,\nsuitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely,\nconventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state,\nconstraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To\naddress these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT\nparadigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns.

The\ncontinuous treatment of visual signals minimizes the information loss for both\nimage understanding and generation while the fully AR formulation renders the\ncharacterization of the correlation between modalities straightforward. The key\nmechanism enabling Orthus to leverage these advantages lies in its\nmodality-specific heads -- one regular language modeling (LM) head predicts\ndiscrete text tokens and one diffusion head generates continuous image features\nconditioning on the output of the backbone. We devise an efficient strategy for\nbuilding Orthus -- by substituting the Vector Quantization (VQ) operation in\nthe existing unified AR model with a soft alternative, introducing a diffusion\nhead, and tuning the added modules to reconstruct images, we can create an\nOrthus-base model effortlessly (e.g., within mere 72 A100 GPU hours).\nOrthus-base can further embrace post-training to better model interleaved\nimages and texts. Empirically, Orthus surpasses competing baselines including\nShow-o and Chameleon across standard benchmarks, achieving a GenEval score of\n0.58 and an MME-P score of 1265.8 using 7B parameters. Orthus also shows\nexceptional mixed-modality generation capabilities, reflecting the potential\nfor handling intricate practical generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Beautimeter is a new tool powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)\ntechnology, designed to evaluate architectural and urban beauty. Rooted in\nChristopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that\nall environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life.\nAlexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and\nthick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as\na basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language\nprocessing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure\nembodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural\nand urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights\ninto the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of\ncase studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as\nwell as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate\nBeautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse\ncontexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter\noffers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create\nspaces that resonate deeply with people. This paper also explores the\nimplications of such technology for architecture and urban design, highlighting\nits potential to enhance both the design process and the assessment of built\nenvironments.

This work proposes a\nmulti-objective black-box backdoor attack in dual domains via evolutionary\nalgorithm (LADDER), the first instance of achieving multiple attack objectives\nsimultaneously by optimizing triggers without requiring prior knowledge about\nvictim model. In particular, we formulate LADDER as a multi-objective\noptimization problem (MOP) and solve it via multi-objective evolutionary\nalgorithm (MOEA). MOEA maintains a population of triggers with trade-offs among\nattack objectives and uses non-dominated sort to drive triggers toward optimal\nsolutions. We further apply preference-based selection to MOEA to exclude\nimpractical triggers. We state that LADDER investigates a new dual-domain\nperspective for trigger stealthiness by minimizing the anomaly between clean\nand poisoned samples in the spectral domain. Lastly, the robustness against\npreprocessing operations is achieved by pushing triggers to low-frequency\nregions. Extensive experiments comprehensively showcase that LADDER achieves\nattack effectiveness of at least 99%, attack robustness with 90.23% (50.09%\nhigher than state-of-the-art attacks on average), superior natural stealthiness\n(1.12x to 196.74x improvement) and excellent spectral stealthiness (8.45x\nenhancement) as compared to current stealthy attacks by the average $l_2$-norm\nacross 5 public datasets.",

Although effective vaccines have been developed\nto mitigate severe symptoms, certain populations, particularly the elderly and\nthose with comorbidities, remain at high risk for severe outcomes and increased\nmortality. Consequently, early identification of the severity and clinical\noutcomes of the disease in these patients is vital to prevent adverse\nprognoses. Although traditional machine learning and deep learning models have\nbeen widely employed in this area, the potential of large language models\n(LLMs) remains largely unexplored. Our research focuses primarily on\nconstructing specialized prompts and adopting multi-objective learning\nstrategies. We started by selecting serological indicators that significantly\ncorrelate with clinical outcomes and disease severity to serve as input data\nfor the model. Blood test samples often contain numerous missing values, and\ntraditional models generally rely on imputation to handle these gaps in the\ndata. In contrast, LLMs offer the advantage of robust semantic understanding.\nBy setting prompts, we can explicitly inform the model when a feature's value\nis missing, without the need for imputation. For the multi-objective learning\nstrategy, the model is designed to first predict disease severity and then\npredict clinical outcomes. Given that LLMs utilize both the input text and the\ngenerated tokens as input for generating the next token, the predicted severity\nis used as a basis for generating the clinical outcome. During the fine-tuning\nof the LLM, the two objectives influence and improve each other. Our\nexperiments were implemented based on the ChatGLM model.

Nonetheless, generalist LLMs continue to fall short\nin reasoning tasks necessitating specialized knowledge. Prior investigations\ninto specialized LLMs focused on domain-specific training, which entails\nsubstantial efforts in domain data acquisition and model parameter fine-tuning.\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes the Way-to-Specialist (WTS)\nframework, which synergizes retrieval-augmented generation with knowledge\ngraphs (KGs) to enhance the specialized capability of LLMs in the absence of\nspecialized training. In distinction to existing paradigms that merely utilize\nexternal knowledge from general KGs or static domain KGs to prompt LLM for\nenhanced domain-specific reasoning, WTS proposes an innovative\n\"LLM$\\circlearrowright$KG\" paradigm, which achieves bidirectional enhancement\nbetween specialized LLM and domain knowledge graph (DKG). The proposed paradigm\nencompasses two closely coupled components: the DKG-Augmented LLM and the\nLLM-Assisted DKG Evolution. The former retrieves question-relevant domain\nknowledge from DKG and uses it to prompt LLM to enhance the reasoning\ncapability for domain-specific tasks; the latter leverages LLM to generate new\ndomain knowledge from processed tasks and use it to evolve DKG. WTS closes the\nloop between DKG-Augmented LLM and LLM-Assisted DKG Evolution, enabling\ncontinuous improvement in the domain specialization as it progressively answers\nand learns from domain-specific questions. We validate the performance of WTS\non 6 datasets spanning 5 domains. The experimental results show that WTS\nsurpasses the previous SOTA in 4 specialized domains and achieves a maximum\nperformance improvement of 11.3%.",

    "abstract": "Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world environments poses\nchallenges due to faults that can manifest in physical hardware from radiation,\naging, and temperature fluctuations. To address this, previous works have\nfocused on protecting DNNs via activation range restriction using clipped ReLU\nand finding the optimal clipping threshold. However, this work instead focuses\non constraining DNN weights by applying saturated activation functions (SAFs):\nTanh, Arctan, and others. SAFs prevent faults from causing DNN weights to\nbecome excessively large, which can lead to model failure. These methods not\nonly enhance the robustness of DNNs against fault injections but also improve\nDNN performance by a small margin. Before deployment, DNNs are trained with\nweights constrained by SAFs. During deployment, the weights without applied SAF\nare written to mediums with faults. When read, weights with faults are applied\nwith SAFs and are used for inference. We demonstrate our proposed method across\nthree datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet 2012) and across three datatypes\n(32-bit floating point (FP32), 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point).\nWe show that our method enables FP32 ResNet18 with ImageNet 2012 to operate at\na bit-error rate of 0.00001 with minor accuracy loss, while without the\nproposed method, the FP32 DNN only produces random guesses.

    "abstract": "The complexity of stocks and industries presents challenges for stock\nprediction. Currently, stock prediction models can be divided into two\ncategories. One category, represented by GRU and ALSTM, relies solely on stock\nfactors for prediction, with limited effectiveness. The other category,\nrepresented by HIST and TRA, incorporates not only stock factors but also\nindustry information, industry financial reports, public sentiment, and other\ninputs for prediction. The second category of models can capture correlations\nbetween stocks by introducing additional information, but the extra data is\ndifficult to standardize and generalize. Considering the current state and\nlimitations of these two types of models, this paper proposes the GRU-PFG\n(Project Factors into Graph) model. This model only takes stock factors as\ninput and extracts inter-stock correlations using graph neural networks. It\nachieves prediction results that not only outperform the others models relies\nsolely on stock factors, but also achieve comparable performance to the second\ncategory models. The experimental results show that on the CSI300 dataset, the\nIC of GRU-PFG is 0.134, outperforming HIST's 0.131 and significantly surpassing\nGRU and Transformer, achieving results better than the second category models.\nMoreover as a model that relies solely on stock factors, it has greater\npotential for generalization.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have enabled smart applications on hardware\ndevices. However, these hardware devices are vulnerable to unintended faults\ncaused by aging, temperature variance, and write errors. These faults can cause\nbit-flips in DNN weights and significantly degrade the performance of DNNs.\nThus, protection against these faults is crucial for the deployment of DNNs in\ncritical applications. Previous works have proposed error correction codes\nbased methods, however these methods often require high overheads in both\nmemory and computation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method\nto harden DNN weights by multiplying weights by constants before storing them\nto fault-prone medium. When used, these weights are divided back by the same\nconstants to restore the original scale. Our method is based on the observation\nthat errors from bit-flips have properties similar to additive noise, therefore\nby dividing by constants can reduce the absolute error from bit-flips. To\ndemonstrate our method, we conduct experiments across four ImageNet 2012\npre-trained models along with three different data types: 32-bit floating\npoint, 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point. This method demonstrates\nthat by only multiplying weights with constants, Top-1 Accuracy of 8-bit fixed\npoint ResNet50 is improved by 54.418 at bit-error rate of 0.0001.",

Inspired by the\nstability of the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM), we propose an\nopposite sampling scheme called random sampling. In brief, random sampling will\nsample from a random noisy space during each diffusion process, while DDPM and\nDDIM sampling will continuously sample from the adjacent or original noisy\nspace. Thus, random sampling obtains more randomness and achieves stronger\nrobustness against adversarial attacks. Correspondingly, we also introduce a\nnovel mediator conditional guidance to guarantee the consistency of the\nprediction under the purified image and clean image input. To expand awareness\nof guided diffusion purification, we conduct a detailed evaluation with\ndifferent sampling methods and our random sampling achieves an impressive\nimprovement in multiple settings. Leveraging mediator-guided random sampling,\nwe also establish a baseline method named DiffAP, which significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in performance and defensive\nstability.

This approach is inherently\nlimited in real-world applications due to the unavoidable information loss in\nsimple undirected graphs and the model optimization challenges that arise when\nexceeding the upper bounds of this sub-optimal data representational capacity.\nAs a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize\nimproving graph quality and representation.

    "abstract": "In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial\nchallenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting,\nimpairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph\nlearning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they predominantly\noperate in centralized architectures and overlook the potential of distributed\ngraph databases to harness collective intelligence for enhanced performance\noptimization. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on\nFederated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple\nevolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and\nprivacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of\nFCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and\nreveals two principal challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local\nGNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise\nconflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both\nadapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client\nexpertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose\nthe POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience\nnodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by\nusing a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge\ntransfer at the central server. Extensive evaluations across multiple graph\ndatasets demonstrate POWER's superior performance over straightforward\nfederated extensions of the centralized CGL algorithms and vision-focused\nfederated continual learning algorithms.

    "abstract": "In the context of a short video & live stream mixed recommendation scenario,\nthe live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to allocate at most\none live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize\nlong-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream\npolicy for accurate live stream allocation. The inappropriate live stream\nallocation policy can significantly affect the duration of the usage app and\nuser retention, which ignores the long-term negative impact of live stream\nallocation. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in\nrecommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement. However,\ntraditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, which\nrestricts the application and deployment in the large-scale industrial\nrecommendation systems, especially in the aforementioned challenging scenario.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced\nMulti-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a\nsupervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance\nreduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict\nbootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we\ndesign a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic\nnetworks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also\npropose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream\nallocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy\nevaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the\nplatform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online\nrecommendation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Predictive queries over spatiotemporal (ST) stream data pose significant data\nprocessing and analysis challenges. ST data streams involve a set of time\nseries whose data distributions may vary in space and time, exhibiting multiple\ndistinct patterns. In this context, assuming a single machine learning model\nwould adequately handle such variations is likely to lead to failure. To\naddress this challenge, we propose StreamEnsemble, a novel approach to\npredictive queries over ST data that dynamically selects and allocates Machine\nLearning models according to the underlying time series distributions and model\ncharacteristics. Our experimental evaluation reveals that this method markedly\noutperforms traditional ensemble methods and single model approaches in terms\nof accuracy and time, demonstrating a significant reduction in prediction error\nof more than 10 times compared to traditional approaches.",

    "abstract": "Social media images have proven to be a valuable source of information for\nunderstanding human interactions with important subjects such as cultural\nheritage, biodiversity, and nature, among others. The task of grouping such\nimages into a number of semantically meaningful clusters without labels is\nchallenging due to the high diversity and complex nature of the visual content\nin addition to their large volume. On the other hand, recent advances in Large\nVisual Models (LVMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Visual Language\nModels (LVLMs) provide an important opportunity to explore new productive and\nscalable solutions. This work proposes, analyzes, and compares various\napproaches based on one or more state-of-the-art LVM, LLM, and LVLM, for\nmapping social media images into a number of predefined classes. As a case\nstudy, we consider the problem of understanding the interactions between humans\nand nature, also known as Nature's Contribution to People or Cultural Ecosystem\nServices (CES). Our experiments show that the highest-performing approaches,\nwith accuracy above 95%, still require the creation of a small labeled dataset.\nThese include the fine-tuned LVM DINOv2 and the LVLM LLaVA-1.5 combined with a\nfine-tuned LLM. The top fully unsupervised approaches, achieving accuracy above\n84%, are the LVLMs, specifically the proprietary GPT-4 model and the public\nLLaVA-1.5 model. Additionally, the LVM DINOv2, when applied in a 10-shot\nlearning setup, delivered competitive results with an accuracy of 83.99%,\nclosely matching the performance of the LVLM LLaVA-1.5.",

    "abstract": "As wireless networks grow to support more complex applications, the Open\nRadio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its smart RAN Intelligent\nController (RIC) modules, becomes a crucial solution for real-time network data\ncollection, analysis, and dynamic management of network resources including\nradio resource blocks and downlink power allocation.

This paper proposes a novel Meta Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (Meta-DRL) strategy, inspired by Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML),\nto advance resource block and downlink power allocation in O-RAN. Our approach\nleverages O-RAN's disaggregated architecture with virtual distributed units\n(DUs) and meta-DRL strategies, enabling adaptive and localized decision-making\nthat significantly enhances network efficiency.

However, these models exhibit\nlimitations when tasked with performing in specialized or low-resource industry\ndomains. More recent approaches use LLMs for generating domain-specific\nsynthetic data but most often they lack in truthfulness and complexity.\nAlternatively, in cases where domain data is available like healthcare and\nfinance most of the LMs are proprietary necessitating the need for a scalable\nmethod to curate real world industry specific pre-training data. In this work,\nwe propose an automated and scalable framework - DoPAMine:Domain-specific\nPre-training Adaptation from seed-guided data Mining, to mine domain specific\ntraining data from a large data corpus for domain adaptation of a LM. The\nframework leverages the parametric knowledge of a LLM to generate diverse and\nrepresentative seed data tailored to a specific domain which is then used to\nmine real world data from a large data corpus like Common Crawl. We evaluated\nour framework's performance in the continual pre-training (CPT) setting by\ntraining two domain specific 7B parameter LMs in healthcare and finance with\ndata mined via DoPAMine. Our experiments show that DoPAMine boosts the\nperformance of pre-trained LLMs on average by 4.9% and 5.1% in zero-shot and\n5-shot settings respectively on healthcare tasks from MMLU, MedQA, MedMCQA and\nPubMedQA datasets, and 2.9% and 6.7% for zero-shot and 5-shot settings\nrespectively on finance tasks from FiQA-SA, FPB and Headlines datasets when\ncompared to the baseline.",

In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon\nenabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a\ngood model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents\nthat learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem\nthat falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning). We\nexpose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as\nwell as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across\nmathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential\nrole of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure\nlearning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of\nnaturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through\nstructure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we\nmathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act\ncautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this\nexample by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may\nguide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing\n-- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.",

Language functions to categorise\nperceptual experiences (e.g., labelling interoceptive states as 'happy') and\nhigher-level constructs (e.g., using 'I' to represent the narrative self).\nPsychedelic use and meditation might be described as altered states that impair\nor intentionally modify the capacity for linguistic categorisation. For\nexample, psychedelic phenomenology is often characterised by 'oceanic\nboundlessness' or 'unity' and 'ego dissolution', which might be expected of a\nsystem unburdened by entrenched language categories. If language breakdown\nplays a role in producing such altered behaviour, multimodal artificial\nintelligence might align more with these phenomenological descriptions when\nattention is shifted away from language. We tested this hypothesis by comparing\nthe semantic embedding spaces from simulated altered states after manipulating\nattentional weights in CLIP and FLAVA models to embedding spaces from altered\nstates questionnaires before manipulation. Compared to random text and various\nother altered states including anxiety, models were more aligned with\ndisembodied, ego-less, spiritual, and unitive states, as well as minimal\nphenomenal experiences, with decreased attention to language and vision.\nReduced attention to language was associated with distinct linguistic patterns\nand blurred embeddings within and, especially, across semantic categories\n(e.g., 'giraffes' become more like 'bananas'). These results lend support to\nthe role of language categorisation in the phenomenology of altered states of\nconsciousness, like those experienced with high doses of psychedelics or\nconcentration meditation, states that often lead to improved mental health and\nwellbeing.",

    "abstract": "Intersecting manifold segmentation has been a focus of research, where\nindividual manifolds, that intersect with other manifolds, are separated to\ndiscover their distinct properties. The proposed method is based on the\nintuition that when a manifold in $D$ dimensional space with an intrinsic\ndimension of $d$ intersects with another manifold, the data variance grows in\nmore than $d$ directions. The proposed method measures local data variances and\ndetermines their vector directions. It counts the number of vectors with\nnon-zero variance, which determines the manifold's intrinsic dimension. For\ndetection of the intersection region, the method adapts to the changes in the\nangular gaps between the corresponding direction vectors of the child and\nparent using exponential moving averages using a tree structure construction.\nAccordingly, it includes those data points in the same manifold whose\nneighborhood is within the adaptive angular difference and eventually\nidentifies the data points in the intersection area of manifolds. Data points\nwhose inclusion in the neighborhood-identified data points increases their\nintrinsic dimensionality are removed based on data variance and distance. The\nproposed method performs better than 18 SOTA manifold segmentation methods in\nARI and NMI scores over 14 real-world datasets with lesser time complexity and\nbetter stability.",

Existing computational approaches cannot achieve satisfactory\nperformance due to the challenges of unavailable large, labeled datasets,\nimbalanced event types, and label noise. To address these challenges, we\npropose a hybrid pipeline that integrates a knowledge-informed machine learning\nmode to prescreen non-SDIEs and a large language model (LLM) to classify SDIEs\ninto four types. In the prescreening stage, we proposed a set of 44 SDIE text\npatterns that consist of the most salient keywords and phrases from six SDIE\ntypes. Text vectorization based on the SDIE patterns generates feature vectors\nthat are highly separable by using a simple binary classifier. The second stage\nbuilds Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based\nLLM, which learns generic English language representations from self-supervised\npretraining on a large dataset and adapts to SDIE classification by fine-tuning\nit on an SDIE dataset. The proposed approaches are evaluated on a dataset with\n10,928 events using precision, recall ratio, F1 score, and average accuracy.\nThe results demonstrate that the prescreening stage can exclude more than 97%\nnon-SDIEs, and the LLM achieves an average accuracy of 93.4% for SDIE\nclassification.",

    "abstract": "As a promising paradigm to collaboratively train models with decentralized\ndata, Federated Learning (FL) can be exploited to fine-tune Large Language\nModels (LLMs). While LLMs correspond to huge size, the scale of the training\ndata significantly increases, which leads to tremendous amounts of computation\nand communication costs. The training data is generally non-Independent and\nIdentically Distributed (non-IID), which requires adaptive data processing\nwithin each device. Although Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can significantly\nreduce the scale of parameters to update in the fine-tuning process, it still\ntakes unaffordable time to transfer the low-rank parameters of all the layers\nin LLMs. In this paper, we propose a Fisher Information-based Efficient\nCurriculum Federated Learning framework (FibecFed) with two novel methods,\ni.e., adaptive federated curriculum learning and efficient sparse parameter\nupdate. First, we propose a fisher information-based method to adaptively\nsample data within each device to improve the effectiveness of the FL\nfine-tuning process. Second, we dynamically select the proper layers for global\naggregation and sparse parameters for local update with LoRA so as to improve\nthe efficiency of the FL fine-tuning process. Extensive experimental results\nbased on 10 datasets demonstrate that FibecFed yields excellent performance (up\nto 45.35% in terms of accuracy) and superb fine-tuning speed (up to 98.61%\nfaster) compared with 17 baseline approaches).",

This limitation prevents these foundational diffusion models\nfrom serving as a unified model in the field of visual generation, like GPT-4\nin the natural language processing field. In this work, we propose ACE, an\nAll-round Creator and Editor, which achieves comparable performance compared to\nthose expert models in a wide range of visual generation tasks. To achieve this\ngoal, we first introduce a unified condition format termed Long-context\nCondition Unit (LCU), and propose a novel Transformer-based diffusion model\nthat uses LCU as input, aiming for joint training across various generation and\nediting tasks. Furthermore, we propose an efficient data collection approach to\naddress the issue of the absence of available training data. It involves\nacquiring pairwise images with synthesis-based or clustering-based pipelines\nand supplying these pairs with accurate textual instructions by leveraging a\nfine-tuned multi-modal large language model. To comprehensively evaluate the\nperformance of our model, we establish a benchmark of manually annotated pairs\ndata across a variety of visual generation tasks. The extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of our model in visual generation fields.\nThanks to the all-in-one capabilities of our model, we can easily build a\nmulti-modal chat system that responds to any interactive request for image\ncreation using a single model to serve as the backend, avoiding the cumbersome\npipeline typically employed in visual agents.

    "abstract": "Large language models demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities but struggle\nto provide personalized content due to their lack of individual user preference\ninformation. Existing methods, such as in-context learning and\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning, fall short in capturing the complexity of\nhuman preferences, especially given the small, personal datasets individuals\npossess. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing small parameter\nmodels as preference agents to generate natural language rules that guide a\nlarger, pre-trained model, enabling efficient personalization. Our method\ninvolves a small, local \"steering wheel\" model that directs the outputs of a\nmuch larger foundation model, producing content tailored to an individual's\npreferences while leveraging the extensive knowledge and capabilities of the\nlarge model. Importantly, this personalization is achieved without the need to\nfine-tune the large model. Experimental results on email and article datasets,\ndemonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms baseline\npersonalization methods. By allowing foundation models to adapt to individual\npreferences in a data and compute-efficient manner, our approach paves the way\nfor highly personalized language model applications.",

Robi Butler is a new\nhousehold robot assistant that enables seamless multimodal remote interaction.\nIt allows the human user to monitor its environment from a first-person view,\nissue voice or text commands, and specify target objects through hand-pointing\ngestures. At its core, a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), interprets multimodal instructions to generate multistep action\nplans. Each plan consists of open-vocabulary primitives supported by\nvision-language models, enabling the robot to process both textual and gestural\ninputs. Zoom provides a convenient interface to implement remote interactions\nbetween the human and the robot. The integration of these components allows\nRobi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in real-world home\nenvironments in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated the system on various\nhousehold tasks, demonstrating its ability to execute complex user commands\nwith multimodal inputs. We also conducted a user study to examine how\nmultimodal interaction influences user experiences in remote human-robot\ninteraction. These results suggest that with the advances in robot foundation\nmodels, we are moving closer to the reality of remote household robot\nassistants.",

However, the impacts of these\ndifferent types of information are not clear. In addition, most existing\napproaches ignore the timestamps in log data, which can potentially provide\nfine-grained sequential and temporal information. In this work, we propose a\nconfigurable Transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the\nsemantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to\nconfigure the different types of information as the model's features.\nAdditionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of\ndifferent lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely\non fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs. With the proposed\nmodel, we conduct a series of experiments with different combinations of input\nfeatures to evaluate the roles of different types of information in anomaly\ndetection. The model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance\ncompared to the baselines when presented with log sequences of varying lengths.\nThe results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in\nidentifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal\ninformation is not significant for anomaly detection on the studied public\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "This study introduces an innovative automatic labeling framework to address\nthe challenges of lexical normalization in social media texts for low-resource\nlanguages like Vietnamese. Social media data is rich and diverse, but the\nevolving and varied language used in these contexts makes manual labeling\nlabor-intensive and expensive. To tackle these issues, we propose a framework\nthat integrates semi-supervised learning with weak supervision techniques. This\napproach enhances the quality of training dataset and expands its size while\nminimizing manual labeling efforts. Our framework automatically labels raw\ndata, converting non-standard vocabulary into standardized forms, thereby\nimproving the accuracy and consistency of the training data. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our weak supervision framework in\nnormalizing Vietnamese text, especially when utilizing Pre-trained Language\nModels. The proposed framework achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.72% and\nmaintains vocabulary integrity with an accuracy of up to 99.22%. Additionally,\nit effectively handles undiacritized text under various conditions. This\nframework significantly enhances natural language normalization quality and\nimproves the accuracy of various NLP tasks, leading to an average accuracy\nincrease of 1-3%.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising approach for\ntransferring knowledge from a larger, more complex teacher model to a smaller\nstudent model. Traditionally, KD involves training the student to mimic the\nteacher's output probabilities, while more advanced techniques have explored\nguiding the student to adopt the teacher's internal representations. Despite\nits widespread success, the performance of KD in binary classification and\nfew-class problems has been less satisfactory. This is because the information\nabout the teacher model's generalization patterns scales directly with the\nnumber of classes. Moreover, several sophisticated distillation methods may not\nbe universally applicable or effective for data types beyond Computer Vision.\nConsequently, effective distillation techniques remain elusive for a range of\nkey real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis, search query\nunderstanding, and advertisement-query relevance assessment. Taking these\nobservations into account, we introduce a novel method for distilling knowledge\nfrom the teacher's model representations, which we term Learning Embedding\nLinear Projections (LELP). Inspired by recent findings about the structure of\nfinal-layer representations, LELP works by identifying informative linear\nsubspaces in the teacher's embedding space, and splitting them into\npseudo-subclasses. The student model is then trained to replicate these\npseudo-classes. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale NLP benchmarks like\nAmazon Reviews and Sentiment140 demonstrate the LELP is consistently\ncompetitive with, and typically superior to, existing state-of-the-art\ndistillation algorithms for binary and few-class problems, where most KD\nmethods suffer.",

This\ndiffusion-based approach streamlines computation, generating architectures\noptimized for accuracy on unseen datasets without further adaptation.

It integrates\nPerformance Predictor models to estimate these metrics and guide diffusion\ngradients.

In this paper, we extend the CFM algorithm by defining\nconditional probability paths along ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic\npaths that connect data pairs of source and target, which are modeled with\nGaussian process (GP) distributions.

However, RLHF has\nlimitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking\nand extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or\nsometimes conflicting objectives). Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires\ncareful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations. This is\noften done via human intuition and does not generalize. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative\nPolicy Optimization (CGPO). The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with\ncost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can\nidentify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner. It shows strong\nempirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive\nhyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines.\nTogether, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching\na pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives.\n  Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms\nstandard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including\ngeneral chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding. Specifically,\nCGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in\nArena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math\nand coding. Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward\nhacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses. This\nbreakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme\nmulti-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art\nin aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.",

Existing approaches separate outliers and normal values into two\nmatrices or migrate outliers from activations to weights, suffering from high\nlatency or accuracy degradation. Based on observing activations from large\nlanguage models, outliers can be classified into channel-wise and spike\noutliers. In this work, we propose Rotated Runtime Smooth (RRS), a\nplug-and-play activation smoother for quantization, consisting of Runtime\nSmooth and the Rotation operation.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been at the forefront of image\nsynthesis, especially in medical fields like histopathology, where they help\naddress challenges such as data scarcity, patient privacy, and class imbalance.\nHowever, several inherent and domain-specific issues remain. For GANs, training\ninstability, mode collapse, and insufficient feedback from binary\nclassification can undermine performance. These challenges are particularly\npronounced with high-resolution histopathology images due to their complex\nfeature representation and high spatial detail. In response to these\nchallenges, this work proposes a novel framework integrating a contrastive\nlearning-based Multistage Progressive Finetuning Siamese Neural Network\n(MFT-SNN) with a Reinforcement Learning-based External Optimizer (RL-EO). The\nMFT-SNN improves feature similarity extraction in histopathology data, while\nthe RL-EO acts as a reward-based guide to balance GAN training, addressing mode\ncollapse and enhancing output quality. The proposed approach is evaluated\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) GAN models and demonstrates superior\nperformance across multiple metrics.",

METHODS: The\nliterature search was conducted on seven databases. ACM Digital Library,\nMedline (via PubMed), Cochrane, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus. The\neffect sizes of the main outcomes were calculated using Cohen's d. Pooled\nresults were used to present an overall estimate of the treatment effect using\na random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 22 randomized controlled trials\nwere evaluated. 3 trials demonstrated that immersive virtual reality improved\nupper limb activity, function and activity of daily life in a way comparable to\nCT. 18 trials showed that NIVR had similar benefits to CT for upper limb\nactivity and function, balance and mobility, activities of daily living and\nparticipation. A comparison between the different forms of VR showed that IVR\nmay be more beneficial than NIVR for upper limb training and activities of\ndaily life. CONCLUSIONS: This study found out that IVR therapies may be more\neffective than NIVR but not CT to improve upper limb activity, function, and\ndaily life activities.

    "abstract": "Goal instructions for autonomous AI agents cannot assume that objects have\nunique names. Instead, objects in goals must be referred to by providing\nsuitable descriptions. However, this raises problems in both classical planning\nand generalized planning. The standard approach to handling existentially\nquantified goals in classical planning involves compiling them into a DNF\nformula that encodes all possible variable bindings and adding dummy actions to\nmap each DNF term into the new, dummy goal. This preprocessing is exponential\nin the number of variables. In generalized planning, the problem is different:\neven if general policies can deal with any initial situation and goal,\nexecuting a general policy requires the goal to be grounded to define a value\nfor the policy features. The problem of grounding goals, namely finding the\nobjects to bind the goal variables, is subtle: it is a generalization of\nclassical planning, which is a special case when there are no goal variables to\nbind, and constraint reasoning, which is a special case when there are no\nactions. In this work, we address the goal grounding problem with a novel\nsupervised learning approach. A GNN architecture, trained to predict the cost\nof partially quantified goals over small domain instances is tested on larger\ninstances involving more objects and different quantified goals. The proposed\narchitecture is evaluated experimentally over several planning domains where\ngeneralization is tested along several dimensions including the number of goal\nvariables and objects that can bind such variables. The scope of the approach\nis also discussed in light of the known relationship between GNNs and C2\nlogics.",

We provide a software tool for this analysis that is suitable\nfor even quite large or dense models, provided a suitably fast pointwise\nconsistent test of conditional independence is available. In addition, we show\nin simulation that the CAFS procedure can pick approximately correct models\nwithout knowing the ground truth.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method of selecting and using multiple datasets\nfor transfer learning for time series classification.

Furthermore, for selecting multiple sources, our method measures the\ntransferability of datasets based on shapelet discovery for effective source\nselection. While traditional transferability measures require considerable time\nfor pre-training all the possible sources for source selection of each possible\narchitecture, our method can be repeatedly used for every possible architecture\nwith a single simple computation.

    "abstract": "Complex logical query answering (CLQA) is a challenging task that involves\nfinding answer entities for complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge\ngraphs (KGs). Previous research has explored the use of pre-trained knowledge\ngraph completion (KGC) models, which can predict the missing facts in KGs, to\nanswer complex logical queries. However, KGC models are typically evaluated\nusing ranking evaluation metrics, which may result in values of predictions of\nKGC models that are not well-calibrated. In this paper, we propose a method for\ncalibrating KGC models, namely CKGC, which enables KGC models to adapt to\nanswering complex logical queries. Notably, CKGC is lightweight and effective.\nThe adaptation function is simple, allowing the model to quickly converge\nduring the adaptation process. The core concept of CKGC is to map the values of\npredictions of KGC models to the range [0, 1], ensuring that values associated\nwith true facts are close to 1, while values linked to false facts are close to\n0. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our\nproposed calibration method can significantly boost model performance in the\nCLQA task. Moreover, our approach can enhance the performance of CLQA while\npreserving the ranking evaluation metrics of KGC models. The code is available\nat https://github.com/changyi7231/CKGC.",

Our model can incorporate existing\nmodels (i.e., generality), ensure the computation is tractable (i.e.,\nefficiency) and enjoy the expressive power of complex random variables (i.e.,\nexpressiveness). The core idea is that we embed entities/relations as elements\nof a symmetric group, i.e., permutations of a set. Permutations of different\nsets can reflect different properties of embedding.

    "abstract": "Fairness in medical AI is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of\nhealthcare delivery. While most of the prior work done on fairness emphasizes\nthe importance of equal performance, we argue that decreases in fairness can be\neither harmful or non-harmful, depending on the type of change and how\nsensitive attributes are used. To this end, we introduce the notion of\npositive-sum fairness, which states that an increase in performance that\nresults in a larger group disparity is acceptable as long as it does not come\nat the cost of individual subgroup performance. This allows sensitive\nattributes correlated with the disease to be used to increase performance\nwithout compromising on fairness.\n  We illustrate this idea by comparing four CNN models that make different use\nof the race attribute in the training phase. The results show that removing all\ndemographic encodings from the images helps close the gap in performance\nbetween the different subgroups, whereas leveraging the race attribute as a\nmodel's input increases the overall performance while widening the disparities\nbetween subgroups. These larger gaps are then put in perspective of the\ncollective benefit through our notion of positive-sum fairness to distinguish\nharmful from non harmful disparities.",

Through empirical\nevaluations on constraint-heavy tasks (e.g., $\\textit{Barman}$,\n$\\textit{Tyreworld}$) and spatially complex environments (e.g.,\n$\\textit{Termes}$, $\\textit{Floortile}$), we highlight o1-preview's strengths\nin self-evaluation and constraint-following, while also identifying bottlenecks\nin decision-making and memory management, particularly in tasks requiring\nrobust spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that o1-preview outperforms GPT-4\nin adhering to task constraints and managing state transitions in structured\nenvironments.

It is economically infeasible to extensively tune\nhyperparameter for the largest runs. Instead, approximately optimal\nhyperparameters must be inferred or \\textit{transferred} from smaller\nexperiments. Hyperparameter transfer across model sizes has been studied in\nYang et al. However, hyperparameter transfer across dataset size -- or token\nhorizon -- has not been studied yet. To remedy this we conduct a large scale\nempirical study on how optimal learning rate (LR) depends on token horizon in\nLLM training. We first demonstrate that the optimal LR changes significantly\nwith token horizon -- longer training necessitates smaller LR. Secondly we\ndemonstrate the the optimal LR follows a scaling law, and that the optimal LR\nfor longer horizons can be accurately estimated from shorter horizons via such\nscaling laws. We also provide a rule-of-thumb for transferring LR across token\nhorizons with zero overhead over current practices. Lastly we provide evidence\nthat LLama-1 used too high LR, and estimate the performance hit from this. We\nthus argue that hyperparameter transfer across data size is an important and\noverlooked component of LLM training.",

Traditional\nrule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming\nand often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based\nmethods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for\nautomated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising,\nLLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax\nerrors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to\nself-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error\nmessages.\n  In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT,\nwhich enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and\nsemantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including\nInitial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error\nFixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block\nin the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and\nsource program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the\nfixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark\nfrom recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue.

    "abstract": "Despite its widespread use in neural networks, error backpropagation has\nfaced criticism for its lack of biological plausibility, suffering from issues\nsuch as the backward locking problem and the weight transport problem. These\nlimitations have motivated researchers to explore more biologically plausible\nlearning algorithms that could potentially shed light on how biological neural\nsystems adapt and learn. Inspired by the counter-current exchange mechanisms\nobserved in biological systems, we propose counter-current learning (CCL), a\nbiologically plausible framework for credit assignment in neural networks. This\nframework employs a feedforward network to process input data and a feedback\nnetwork to process targets, with each network enhancing the other through\nanti-parallel signal propagation. By leveraging the more informative signals\nfrom the bottom layer of the feedback network to guide the updates of the top\nlayer of the feedforward network and vice versa, CCL enables the simultaneous\ntransformation of source inputs to target outputs and the dynamic mutual\ninfluence of these transformations. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets using multi-layer perceptrons and\nconvolutional neural networks demonstrate that CCL achieves comparable\nperformance to other biologically plausible algorithms while offering a more\nbiologically realistic learning mechanism.

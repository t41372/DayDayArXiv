    "abstract": "Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from demonstration-based guidance.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with \"catastrophic forgetting,\" where learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models face \"mode collapse,\" where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14% higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly, random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.",

We present ODKE+, a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195 predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9 million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability.

    "abstract": "We study reinforcement learning from human feedback under misspecification. Sometimes human feedback is systematically wrong on certain types of inputs, like a broken compass that points the wrong way in specific regions. We prove that when feedback is biased on a fraction alpha of contexts with bias strength epsilon, any learning algorithm needs exponentially many samples exp(n*alpha*epsilon^2) to distinguish between two possible \"true\" reward functions that differ only on these problematic contexts. However, if you can identify where feedback is unreliable (a \"calibration oracle\"), you can focus your limited questions there and overcome the exponential barrier with just O(1/(alpha*epsilon^2)) queries. This quantifies why alignment is hard: rare edge cases with subtly biased feedback create an exponentially hard learning problem unless you know where to look.\n  The gap between what we optimize (proxy from human feedback) and what we want (true objective) is fundamentally limited by how common the problematic contexts are (alpha), how wrong the feedback is there (epsilon), and how much the true objectives disagree there (gamma). Murphy's Law for AI alignment: the gap always wins unless you actively route around misspecification.",

Multilayered windowing has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks. Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.",

Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs) have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing 62% fewer parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.",

We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries, while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to 42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable performance in real-world settings.",

Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\\%$ to $37\\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.",

    "abstract": "As our cities and communities become smarter, the systems that keep us safe, such as traffic control centers, emergency response networks, and public transportation, also become more complex. With this complexity comes a greater risk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's lives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers, safety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public safety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows users to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about, such as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the click of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by using popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or CISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information, but rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the AI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can highlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can be done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local health service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT brings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer. It is designed not just to analyze threats, but to empower people to understand and act on them, faster, smarter, and with more confidence.",

    "abstract": "Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world social media text.",

    "abstract": "Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments. However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models' complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers, and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of summaries.",

    "abstract": "Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph (which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%, 4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph & configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning alone cannot fix.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.",

We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover, integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector -- placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio, video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e., satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules) with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs 64$\\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality coverage of foundation models.",

Existing methods primarily rely on single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with additional information about the electronic structure and interactions. Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed features and adaptive task weighting.",

    "abstract": "While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. We evaluate on ARC-AGI, a benchmark that stresses compositional generalization and abstract reasoning, making it a natural fit for concept memory. Our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms fixed settings, supporting the hypothesis that accumulating and abstracting patterns enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

While prior work has addressed attribute prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute \"has four legs\" is common to both \"dogs\" and \"chairs\". To enable this evaluation, we introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping, embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.",

These two types of data are typically used by approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate, and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and families.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts, activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects. Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation. This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language models.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias) to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group, people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13% if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work, design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and determining which are subject to oversight.",

However, LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly aims to reconstruct the original input within a reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when the projection is frozen.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.",

To address these issues, we propose Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation (PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering. These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed, their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale, highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice, underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.

We show that such personality priming yields consistent, interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities test for automated verification.

However, dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.\n  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which enable them to converge more stably by ``refining\" their innate features, and ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.\n  Based on these findings, we introduce \\textbf{FE2E}, a framework that pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow matching loss into the ``consistent velocity\" training objective. And we use logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks. Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.\n  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple datasets.

To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.",

    "abstract": "Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed, sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy, enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions, with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for future real-world validation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions. These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques, showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple weight magnitude considerations.",

In the last decades, the production and design of such batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers, and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the closed-loop performance of the cell.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern, highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul, the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities. PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities, each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy, achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in the field.",

In this work, we propose Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a novel activation probing technique for hallucination detection, which processes the LLM activations across the entire residual stream as a joint sequence. Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs and three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to baselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at higher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to disambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled responses to a given prompt. This allows us to propose a detect-then-mitigate strategy using CLAP to reduce hallucinations and improve LLM reliability compared to direct mitigation approaches. Finally, we show that CLAP maintains high reliability even when applied out-of-distribution.",

Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM, enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision making.",

Recently, OpenAI o3 model introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically, our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.",

    "abstract": "A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$δ$-approximate 0-1 law'' for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible worlds than the uniform distribution does.",

    "abstract": "Eye-tracking technology can aid in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and tracing a person's identity. However, this technology poses a significant risk to privacy, as it captures sensitive information about individuals and increases the likelihood that data can be traced back to them. This paper proposes a human-centered framework designed to prevent identity backtracking while preserving the pedagogical benefits of AI-powered eye tracking in interactive learning environments. We explore how real-time data anonymization, ethical design principles, and regulatory compliance (such as GDPR) can be integrated to build trust and transparency. We first demonstrate the potential for backtracking student IDs and diagnoses in various scenarios using serious game-based eye-tracking data. We then provide a two-stage privacy-preserving framework that prevents participants from being tracked while still enabling diagnostic classification. The first phase covers four scenarios: I) Predicting disorder diagnoses based on different game levels. II) Predicting student IDs based on different game levels. III) Predicting student IDs based on randomized data. IV) Utilizing K-Means for out-of-sample data. In the second phase, we present a two-stage framework that preserves privacy. We also employ Federated Learning (FL) across multiple clients, incorporating a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls. In the first phase, the proposed framework achieved 99.3% accuracy for scenario 1, 63% accuracy for scenario 2, and 99.7% accuracy for scenario 3, successfully identifying and assigning a new student ID in scenario 4. In phase 2, we effectively prevented backtracking and established a secure identity management system with dummy IDs and administrator-only access controls, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.40%.",

    "abstract": "AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction. Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression.

However, reliable defect detection requires high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model, using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal defects.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). By assuming a continuous-time linear time-invariant system with simultaneously-diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a closed-form solution of the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently propagate uncertainties through the dynamics from keys to queries. A generalization of attention naturally arises as the maximum likelihood solution for filtering the trajectory of this linear SDE, with attention weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated query-key precisions. We further constrain the system dynamics and noise in order to obtain a simplified variant with the same computational and memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of zero decay and process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover a complex-valued generalization of ordinary dot-product attention with rotary positional encodings.",

The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms other training-free approaches.

Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both precision and recall.

    "abstract": "Mapping clinical documents to standardised clinical vocabularies is an important task, as it provides structured data for information retrieval and analysis, which is essential to clinical research, hospital administration and improving patient care. However, manual coding is both difficult and time-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can potentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of structured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires mapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge sources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the use of external resources for representing the input documents has been underexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the input documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that provide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting knowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with 23\\% of the original text while retaining 90\\% of the information. We assess the effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it into the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD. Our experiments yield improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20\\% on popular benchmarks, while improving training efficiency. We attribute this improvement to different types of entities and relationships in the KG, and demonstrate the improved explainability potential of the approach over the text-only baseline.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason, problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans, a successor \"digital species\", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain, joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However, the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not silicon.",

Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024 prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes. Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt engineering landscapes.",

To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts.

However, most works on computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN (based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior, but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds) is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing styles and at the full game of poker.

However, less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures, thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code will be released in: https://github.com/bytedance/NEVC.",

The approach effectively reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.",

While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22 subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs, where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging.",

We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which improved the model's performance.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop. In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space, a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous, reasoning-level semantic space. This shift in perspective serves as a conceptual bridge, revitalizing foundational principles from classical learning theory to analyze the unique dynamics of LLMs. By analyzing this process from both a noise perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother, more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.",

Instead of relying on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval.

    "abstract": "Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task, models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations, where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world scenarios.",

Local search solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors. The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating local search solver design.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion, ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral, task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation, present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and multi-agent extensions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models. This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation.",

This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper exploration of security mechanisms.

As a result, the LLM agents generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives (prompt-specified constraints such as the 60% threshold) and internal incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training), demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM agents.",

The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD), most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation, change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal RSCD.

To this end, we present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically, we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual fabrication as the most common failure mode.

    "abstract": "In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.",

Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first, heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for solving planning problems involving control parameters.",

Earlier \"refusal-direction\" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned, nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace. The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs deployment in security-sensitive domains.",

    "abstract": "Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First, existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments, featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261 movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character. Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.",

To address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

The framework enables rapid adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains. Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that our $\\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task horizon.",

While supervised fine-tuning, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning. Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse fine-tuning scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant accuracy degradation due to insufficient reasoning ability when dealing with complex and abstract tasks. Thought structures such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT) focus on enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs. However, they suffer from inherent drawbacks such as redundancy within the same layer of the tree structure and the singularity of the paths in the chain structure. Some studies have utilized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to enhance CoT and ToT in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, yet the fundamental shortcomings of the thought structures still persist. Furthermore, when dealing with multi-entity and multi-hop information, the retrieved verification knowledge often contains large amounts of fragmented, superficial, or even erroneous data, misleading the reasoning process of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient thought structure for LLMs. MoT explores problems in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through a \"column-cell communication\" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep thinking while reducing redundancy in the thought nodes within the column cells, thereby enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs. Additionally, through a fact-correction mechanism, it leverages the knowledge graph triples retrieved by RAG and the original text to construct knowledge units and correct erroneous answers. To validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted extensive experiments in three tasks: 24-point game, question answering evaluation, and proposition writing.The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with reasoning time only 14.4\\% of that of the baseline method, proving its efficiency and accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.",

However, current medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities, then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent) tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall preference).

    "abstract": "Large Language Model safety alignment predominantly operates on a binary assumption that requests are either safe or unsafe. This classification proves insufficient when models encounter ethical dilemmas, where the capacity to reason through moral trade-offs creates a distinct attack surface. We formalize this vulnerability through TRIAL, a multi-turn red-teaming methodology that embeds harmful requests within ethical framings. TRIAL achieves high attack success rates across most tested models by systematically exploiting the model's ethical reasoning capabilities to frame harmful actions as morally necessary compromises. Building on these insights, we introduce ERR (Ethical Reasoning Robustness), a defense framework that distinguishes between instrumental responses that enable harmful outcomes and explanatory responses that analyze ethical frameworks without endorsing harmful acts. ERR employs a Layer-Stratified Harm-Gated LoRA architecture, achieving robust defense against reasoning-based attacks while preserving model utility.",

    "abstract": "In this study we develop dimension-reduction techniques to accelerate diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models (hence, CSDM): First, compress the dataset into a latent space (from an ambient space), and train a diffusion model in the latent space; next, apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space for decoding back to the original space; and the goal is to facilitate the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under certain sparsity assumptions on data, our proposed approach achieves provably faster convergence, via combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. It also sheds light on the best choice of the latent space dimension. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we run numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including handwritten digits, medical and climate images, and financial time series for stress testing.",

Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new, conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.",

Prior systems often flatten garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates. These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.",

However, data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information pose significant challenges. While graph-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown promise in brain network analysis, they primarily focus on time-domain representations, often overlooking the rich information embedded in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose Frequency-Enhanced Network (FENet), a novel SSL framework specially designed for fMRI data that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information to improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets. FENet constructs multi-view brain networks based on the inherent properties of fMRI data, explicitly incorporating frequency information into the learning process of representation. Additionally, it employs domain-specific encoders to capture temporal-spectral characteristics, including an efficient frequency-domain encoder that highlights disease-relevant frequency features. Finally, FENet introduces a domain consistency-guided learning objective, which balances the utilization of diverse information and generates frequency-enhanced brain graph representations. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets demonstrate that FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong performance in minimal data conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between various frequency-domain features and psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the critical role of high-frequency information in disorder detection.",

To develop a non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising 345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131, respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.",

    "abstract": "Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However, CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer, which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL.

In this study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12 state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However, despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness.

The first module leverages a deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD.

    "abstract": "Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich, emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned, interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in artificial life and beyond.",

These models typically operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation. Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment, limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model (LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity, mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation framework.",

While promising, the assumption of agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods in MFGs.",

    "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.",

    "abstract": "Residential buildings contribute significantly to energy use, health outcomes, and carbon emissions. In New Zealand, housing quality has historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades) into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling, integration with national datasets, and longitudinal trials to assess real-world adoption.",

An existing model of echo chambers is the \"gravity well\" model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells. We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a wide range of viewpoints.\n  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.\n  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common points of amplification.",

    "abstract": "Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable, human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction, color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.",

While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.

We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain; Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China).

We also present an automated pipeline that connects the benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles, making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms. Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.",

However, within the context of contemporary e-commerce, traditional planning paradigms, typically characterized by fragmented processes and static optimization, prove inadequate in addressing dynamic demand, organizational silos, and the complexity of multi-stage coordination. To address these challenges, this study proposes a fundamental rethinking of supply chain planning, redefining it not merely as a computational task, but as an interactive, integrated, and automated cognitive process. This new paradigm emphasizes the organic unification of human strategic intent with adaptive execution, shifting the focus from rigid control to continuous, intelligent orchestration. To operationalize this conceptual shift, we introduce a Generative AI-powered agentic framework. Functioning as an intelligent cognitive interface, this framework bridges the gap between unstructured business contexts and structured analytical workflows, enabling the system to comprehend complex semantics and coordinate decisions across organizational boundaries. We demonstrate the empirical validity of this approach within JD.com's large-scale operations. The deployment confirms the efficacy of this cognitive paradigm, yielding an approximate 22% improvement in planning accuracy and a 2% increase in in-stock rates, thereby validating the transformation of planning into an adaptive, knowledge-driven capability.",

A primary contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.\n  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.\n  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations, specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable legal grounding via RAG.",

In this work, we propose SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC = 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.",

    "abstract": "Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) remains fundamentally hard: without structure, any agent needs $Ω(|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|/p)$ samples to recover rewards. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) as a first concrete step toward a structural reward learning framework. Our key idea is to exploit approximate low-rank + sparse structure in the reward matrix, under policy-biased (MNAR) sampling. We prove recovery guarantees with inverse-propensity weighting, and establish a visitation-weighted error-to-regret bound linking completion error to control performance. Importantly, when assumptions weaken, PAMC degrades gracefully: confidence intervals widen and the algorithm abstains, ensuring safe fallback to exploration. Empirically, PAMC improves sample efficiency across Atari-26 (10M steps), DM Control, MetaWorld MT50, D4RL offline RL, and preference-based RL benchmarks, outperforming DrQ-v2, DreamerV3, Agent57, T-REX/D-REX, and PrefPPO under compute-normalized comparisons. Our results highlight PAMC as a practical and principled tool when structural rewards exist, and as a concrete first instantiation of a broader structural reward learning perspective.",

    "abstract": "Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but may have different generative models containing different latent variables. Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function of the other agents latents?\n  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to approximation error in the natural latent conditions.",

    "abstract": "Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.",

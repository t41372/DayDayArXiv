However, no\nresearch has examined the impact of LLM size on factual inconsistency in D2T.\nIn this paper, we investigate how factual inconsistency in D2T scales with LLM\nsize by exploring two scaling laws: power law and exponential scaling.

For a\ncomprehensive empirical study, we analyze three popular LLM families across\nfive D2T datasets, measuring factual inconsistency inversely using four\nstate-of-the-art consistency metrics.

As the demand for accurate emotion recognition continues to\ngrow, efficient finetuning approaches are needed to reduce the computational\nburden.

We present various finetuning techniques, including full finetuning,\npartial finetuning of transformer layers, finetuning with mixed precision,\npartial finetuning with caching, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on the Wav2Vec\n2.0 base model. We find that partial finetuning with mixed precision achieves\nperformance comparable to full finetuning while increasing training speed by\n67%. Caching intermediate representations further boosts efficiency, yielding\nan 88% speedup and a 71% reduction in learnable parameters. We recommend\nfinetuning the final three transformer layers in mixed precision to balance\nperformance and training efficiency, and adding intermediate representation\ncaching for optimal speed with minimal performance trade-offs.

      "abstract": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has been a go-to and effective method for\nenhancing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in relatively small LLMs by\nfine-tuning them with long CoT responses from larger LLMs. To continually\nimprove reasoning abilities, we can either collect new high-quality long CoT\nreasoning SFT data or repeatedly train on existing SFT datasets. However,\nacquiring new long CoT SFT data is costly and limited, while repeated training\noften results in a performance plateau or decline. To further boost the\nperformance with the SFT data, we propose Thinking Preference Optimization\n(ThinkPO), a simple yet effective post-SFT method that enhances long CoT\nreasoning without requiring new long CoT responses. Instead, ThinkPO utilizes\nreadily available or easily obtainable short CoT reasoning responses as\nrejected answers and long CoT responses as chosen answers for the same\nquestion. It then applies direct preference optimization to encourage the model\nto favor longer reasoning outputs. Experiments show that ThinkPO further\nimproves the reasoning performance of SFT-ed models, e.g. it increases math\nreasoning accuracy of SFT-ed models by 8.6% and output length by 25.9%.\nNotably, ThinkPO is capable of continually boosting the performance of the\npublicly distilled SFT model, e.g., increasing the official\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's performance on MATH500 from 87.4% to 91.2%.",

Since lifted inference techniques\nrely on reductions to variants of FOMC, the design of scalable methods for FOMC\nhas attracted attention from both theoreticians and practitioners over the past\ndecade. Recently, a new approach based on first-order knowledge compilation was\nproposed. This approach, called Crane, instead of simply providing the final\ncount, generates definitions of (possibly recursive) functions that can be\nevaluated with different arguments to compute the model count for any domain\nsize. However, this approach is not fully automated, as it requires manual\nevaluation of the constructed functions. The primary contribution of this work\nis a fully automated compilation algorithm, called Gantry, which transforms the\nfunction definitions into C++ code equipped with arbitrary-precision\narithmetic. These additions allow the new FOMC algorithm to scale to domain\nsizes over 500,000 times larger than the current state of the art, as\ndemonstrated through experimental results.",

The LLM embodies consequentialist, deontological, virtue, social\njustice, and care ethics as moral principles to assign belief values to\nrecommended actions during ethical decision-making. An ethical layer aggregates\nbelief scores from multiple LLM-derived moral perspectives using Belief\nJensen-Shannon Divergence and Dempster-Shafer Theory into probability scores\nthat also serve as the shaping reward, steering the agent toward choices that\nalign with a balanced ethical framework. This integrated learning framework\nhelps the RL agent navigate moral uncertainty in complex environments and\nenables it to make morally sound decisions across diverse tasks. Our approach,\ntested across different LLM variants and compared with other belief aggregation\ntechniques, demonstrates improved consistency, adaptability, and reduced\nreliance on handcrafted ethical rewards. This method is especially effective in\ndynamic scenarios where ethical challenges arise unexpectedly, making it\nwell-suited for real-world applications.",

Current chatbots, driven by large language models (LLMs),\nmimic human linguistic behaviour but lack the moral and rational capacities\nessential for genuine interpersonal respect. Human beings are prone to\nanthropomorphise chatbots. Indeed, chatbots appear to be deliberately designed\nto elicit that response. As a result, human beings' behaviour toward chatbots\noften resembles behaviours typical of interaction between moral agents. Drawing\non a second-personal, relational account of dignity, we argue that interacting\nwith chatbots in this way is incompatible with the dignity of users. We show\nthat, since second-personal respect is premised on reciprocal recognition of\nsecond-personal authority, behaving towards chatbots in ways that convey\nsecond-personal respect is bound to misfire in morally problematic ways, given\nthe lack of reciprocity. Consequently, such chatbot interactions amount to\nsubtle but significant violations of self-respect: the respect we are dutybound\nto show for our own dignity. We illustrate this by discussing four actual\nchatbot use cases (information retrieval, customer service, advising, and\ncompanionship), and propound that the increasing societal pressure to engage in\nsuch interactions with chatbots poses a hitherto underappreciated threat to\nhuman dignity.",

However, LLMs still struggle with problems\nrequiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online\nshopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Unlike pure\ntext data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging.\nMoreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders\ntheir fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity. To address LLM\nagents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a\nreward model from the environment without human annotations. This model can be\nused to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics\nfor task planning. Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based\nagent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action\ntrajectories. Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent\nand synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each\ntrajectory. These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative\nresponse) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable\nof scoring action trajectories. The effectiveness and generalizability of our\nframework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent\nbenchmarks. In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant\nadvancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities.

      "abstract": "We investigate the training dynamics of deep classifiers by examining how\nhierarchical relationships between classes evolve during training. Through\nextensive experiments, we argue that the learning process in classification\nproblems can be understood through the lens of label clustering. Specifically,\nwe observe that networks tend to distinguish higher-level (hypernym) categories\nin the early stages of training, and learn more specific (hyponym) categories\nlater. We introduce a novel framework to track the evolution of the feature\nmanifold during training, revealing how the hierarchy of class relations\nemerges and refines across the network layers. Our analysis demonstrates that\nthe learned representations closely align with the semantic structure of the\ndataset, providing a quantitative description of the clustering process.\nNotably, we show that in the hypernym label space, certain properties of neural\ncollapse appear earlier than in the hyponym label space, helping to bridge the\ngap between the initial and terminal phases of learning. We believe our\nfindings offer new insights into the mechanisms driving hierarchical learning\nin deep networks, paving the way for future advancements in understanding deep\nlearning dynamics.",

Existing data selection\nmethods predominantly rely on proxy models or loss-based metrics, both of which\nimpose substantial computational overheads due to the necessity of model\ninference and backpropagation. To address this challenge, we propose PRISM, a\nnovel training-free approach for efficient multimodal data selection.

Instead, it leverages Pearson\ncorrelation analysis to quantify the intrinsic visual encoding properties of\nMLLMs, computing a task-specific correlation score to identify high-value\ninstances. This not only enbles data-efficient selection,but maintains the\noriginal performance. Empirical evaluations across multiple MLLMs demonstrate\nthat PRISM reduces the overall time required for visual instruction tuning and\ndata selection to just 30% of conventional methods, while surpassing fully\nfine-tuned models across eight multimodal and three language understanding\nbenchmarks, achieving a 101.7% relative improvement in final performance.",

      "abstract": "How we should design and interact with social artificial intelligence depends\non the socio-relational role the AI is meant to emulate or occupy. In human\nsociety, relationships such as teacher-student, parent-child, neighbors,\nsiblings, or employer-employee are governed by specific norms that prescribe or\nproscribe cooperative functions including hierarchy, care, transaction, and\nmating. These norms shape our judgments of what is appropriate for each\npartner. For example, workplace norms may allow a boss to give orders to an\nemployee, but not vice versa, reflecting hierarchical and transactional\nexpectations. As AI agents and chatbots powered by large language models are\nincreasingly designed to serve roles analogous to human positions - such as\nassistant, mental health provider, tutor, or romantic partner - it is\nimperative to examine whether and how human relational norms should extend to\nhuman-AI interactions. Our analysis explores how differences between AI systems\nand humans, such as the absence of conscious experience and immunity to\nfatigue, may affect an AI's capacity to fulfill relationship-specific functions\nand adhere to corresponding norms. This analysis, which is a collaborative\neffort by philosophers, psychologists, relationship scientists, ethicists,\nlegal experts, and AI researchers, carries important implications for AI\nsystems design, user behavior, and regulation. While we accept that AI systems\ncan offer significant benefits such as increased availability and consistency\nin certain socio-relational roles, they also risk fostering unhealthy\ndependencies or unrealistic expectations that could spill over into human-human\nrelationships. We propose that understanding and thoughtfully shaping (or\nimplementing) suitable human-AI relational norms will be crucial for ensuring\nthat human-AI interactions are ethical, trustworthy, and favorable to human\nwell-being.",

      "abstract": "This work demonstrates that the tools and principles driving the success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) can be repurposed to tackle distribution-level\ntasks, where the goal is to predict properties of the data-generating\ndistribution rather than labels for individual datapoints. These tasks\nencompass statistical inference problems such as parameter estimation,\nhypothesis testing, or mutual information estimation. Framing these tasks\nwithin traditional machine learning pipelines is challenging, as supervision is\ntypically tied to individual datapoint. We propose meta-statistical learning, a\nframework inspired by multi-instance learning that reformulates statistical\ninference tasks as supervised learning problems. In this approach, entire\ndatasets are treated as single inputs to neural networks, which predict\ndistribution-level parameters. Transformer-based architectures, without\npositional encoding, provide a natural fit due to their permutation-invariance\nproperties. By training on large-scale synthetic datasets, meta-statistical\nmodels can leverage the scalability and optimization infrastructure of\nTransformer-based LLMs. We demonstrate the framework's versatility with\napplications in hypothesis testing and mutual information estimation, showing\nstrong performance, particularly for small datasets where traditional neural\nmethods struggle.",

Recent advancements, such as\nOpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT\nsequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance.\nHowever, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs\nlead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user\nexperience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this\nlimitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and\nreveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we\npropose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to\nselectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT\ncompression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving\nstrong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct,\nTokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less\nthan a 0.4% performance drop.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through\ntraining-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their\ncapabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as\nthe scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer\nfrom accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational\nresources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue,\nwe observe that complex reasoning can be achieved by solving a series of\nindependent and self-contained subquestions. These subquestions are essentially\n\\textit{atomic questions}, exhibiting the memoryless property similar to Markov\nprocesses. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (\\our), where\neach state transition consists of decomposing the current question into a\ndependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions,\nforming a simplified question that maintains answer equivalence with the\noriginal problem. This answer preservation enables the iterative\n\\textit{decomposition-contraction} process to naturally form a meaningful\nMarkov reasoning process. Furthermore, these atomic states can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling \\our to serve as a\nplug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities.

      "abstract": "Decades of research in machine learning have given us powerful tools for\nmaking accurate predictions. But when used in social settings and on human\ninputs, better accuracy does not immediately translate to better social\noutcomes. This may not be surprising given that conventional learning\nframeworks are not designed to express societal preferences -- let alone\npromote them. This position paper argues that machine learning is currently\nmissing, and can gain much from incorporating, a proper notion of social\nwelfare. The field of welfare economics asks: how should we allocate limited\nresources to self-interested agents in a way that maximizes social benefit? We\nargue that this perspective applies to many modern applications of machine\nlearning in social contexts, and advocate for its adoption. Rather than\ndisposing of prediction, we aim to leverage this forte of machine learning for\npromoting social welfare. We demonstrate this idea by proposing a conceptual\nframework that gradually transitions from accuracy maximization (with awareness\nto welfare) to welfare maximization (via accurate prediction). We detail\napplications and use-cases for which our framework can be effective, identify\ntechnical challenges and practical opportunities, and highlight future avenues\nworth pursuing.",

Low-quality reasoning chains may falsely\nmatch binary truth labels, introducing faulty reasoning into the\nself-improvement process and ultimately degrading performance. To address this,\nwe propose STRIVE: Structured Reasoning for Self-Improved Verification. Our\nmethod introduces a structured reasoning design with Claim Decomposition,\nEntity Analysis, and Evidence Grounding Verification.

STRIVE begins with a warm-up phase, where the base model\nis fine-tuned on a small number of annotated examples to learn the structured\nreasoning design. It is then applied to generate reasoning chains for all\ntraining examples, selecting only those that are correct and structurally sound\nfor subsequent self-improvement training. We demonstrate that STRIVE achieves\nsignificant improvements over baseline models, with a 31.4% performance gain\nover the base model and 20.7% over Chain of Thought on the HOVER datasets,\nhighlighting its effectiveness.",

Key contributions include: 1) a 130B-parameter unified\nspeech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and\ngeneration, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced; 2) a generative\nspeech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and\nproduces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through\ndistillation; 3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic\nadjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP; 4) an enhanced\ncognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities\nto manage complex tasks effectively. Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360\nevaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human\nevaluations, especially in terms of instruction following.

This\nis because the ``trial-and-error'' training style makes RL agents extremely\ndependent on the specific traffic environment, which also requires a long\nconvergence time. To address these issues, we propose a novel Federated\nImitation Learning (FIL)-based framework for multi-intersection TSC, named\nFitLight, which allows RL agents to plug-and-play for any traffic environment\nwithout additional pre-training cost. Unlike existing imitation learning\napproaches that rely on pre-training RL agents with demonstrations, FitLight\nallows real-time imitation learning and seamless transition to reinforcement\nlearning. Due to our proposed knowledge-sharing mechanism and novel hybrid\npressure-based agent design, RL agents can quickly find a best control policy\nwith only a few episodes. Moreover, for resource-constrained TSC scenarios,\nFitLight supports model pruning and heterogeneous model aggregation, such that\nRL agents can work on a micro-controller with merely 16{\\it KB} RAM and 32{\\it\nKB} ROM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, FitLight not only provides a superior starting point but also\nconverges to a better final solution on both real-world and synthetic datasets,\neven under extreme resource limitations.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous action spaces encounters persistent\nchallenges, such as inefficient exploration and convergence to suboptimal\nsolutions. To address these limitations, we propose CAMEL, a novel framework\nintegrating LLM-generated suboptimal policies into the RL training pipeline.\nCAMEL leverages dynamic action masking and an adaptive epsilon-masking\nmechanism to guide exploration during early training stages while gradually\nenabling agents to optimize policies independently. At the core of CAMEL lies\nthe integration of Python-executable suboptimal policies generated by LLMs\nbased on environment descriptions and task objectives. Although simplistic and\nhard-coded, these policies offer valuable initial guidance for RL agents. To\neffectively utilize these priors, CAMEL employs masking-aware optimization to\ndynamically constrain the action space based on LLM outputs. Additionally,\nepsilon-masking gradually reduces reliance on LLM-generated guidance, enabling\nagents to transition from constrained exploration to autonomous policy\nrefinement. Experimental validation on Gymnasium MuJoCo environments\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of CAMEL. In Hopper-v4 and Ant-v4, LLM-generated\npolicies significantly improve sample efficiency, achieving performance\ncomparable to or surpassing expert masking baselines. For Walker2d-v4, where\nLLMs struggle to accurately model bipedal gait dynamics, CAMEL maintains robust\nRL performance without notable degradation, highlighting the framework's\nadaptability across diverse tasks. While CAMEL shows promise in enhancing\nsample efficiency and mitigating convergence challenges, these issues remain\nopen for further research. Future work aims to generalize CAMEL to multimodal\nLLMs for broader observation-action spaces and automate policy evaluation,\nreducing human intervention and enhancing scalability in RL training pipelines.",

Quantization, a technique that reduces the precision of model\nparameters, offers a promising solution for improving LLM efficiency and\nsustainability.

Here, we\ninvestigate a training strategy for quantization-aware pre-training, where the\nmodels are first trained with 16-bit precision and then transition into\n1.58-bit quantization-aware training. Our results on 11 downstream tasks show\nthat this 16-to-1.58-bit training strategy is preferable over full 1.58-bit\ntraining and leaves models closer to those which have undergone 16-bit\ntraining.

      "abstract": "Many existing approaches for learning from labeled data assume the existence\nof gold-standard labels. According to these approaches, inter-annotator\ndisagreement is seen as noise to be removed, either through refinement of\nannotation guidelines, label adjudication, or label filtering. However,\nannotator disagreement can rarely be totally eradicated, especially on more\nsubjective tasks such as sentiment analysis or hate speech detection where\ndisagreement is natural. Therefore, a new approach to learning from labeled\ndata, called data perspectivism, seeks to leverage inter-annotator disagreement\nto learn models that stay true to the inherent uncertainty of the task by\ntreating annotations as opinions of the annotators, rather than gold-standard\nfacts. Despite this conceptual grounding, existing methods under data\nperspectivism are limited to using disagreement as the sole source of\nannotation uncertainty. To expand the possibilities of data perspectivism, we\nintroduce Subjective Logic Encodings (SLEs), a flexible framework for\nconstructing classification targets that explicitly encodes annotations as\nopinions of the annotators. Based on Subjective Logic Theory, SLEs encode\nlabels as Dirichlet distributions and provide principled methods for encoding\nand aggregating various types of annotation uncertainty -- annotator\nconfidence, reliability, and disagreement -- into the targets. We show that\nSLEs are a generalization of other types of label encodings as well as how to\nestimate models to predict SLEs using a distribution matching objective.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an inference system\noptimized for BitNet b1.58 and ternary LLMs. Given that mixed-precision matrix\nmultiplication (mpGEMM) constitutes the bulk of inference time in ternary LLMs,\nBitnet.cpp incorporates a novel mpGEMM library to facilitate\nsub-2-bits-per-weight, efficient and lossless inference. The library features\ntwo core solutions: Ternary Lookup Table (TL), which addresses spatial\ninefficiencies of previous bit-wise methods, and Int2 with a Scale (I2_S),\nwhich ensures lossless edge inference, both enabling high-speed inference. Our\nexperiments show that Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a 6.25x increase in speed over\nfull-precision baselines and up to 2.32x over low-bit baselines, setting new\nbenchmarks in the field. Additionally, we expand TL to element-wise lookup\ntable (ELUT) for low-bit LLMs in the appendix, presenting both theoretical and\nempirical evidence of its considerable potential.

BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications\nwith comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by\nexecuting end-to-end exploits.

While\naudio chord recognition systems have achieved significant accuracy for small\nvocabularies (e.g., major/minor chords), large-vocabulary chord recognition\nremains a challenging problem. This complexity also arises from the inherent\nlong-tail distribution of chords, where rare chord types are underrepresented\nin most datasets, leading to insufficient training samples.

KT\nhas received significant attention since it facilitates personalized\nexperiences in educational situations. Simultaneously, the autoregressive\nmodeling on the sequence of former exercises has been proven effective for this\ntask. One of the primary challenges in autoregressive modeling for Knowledge\nTracing is effectively representing the anterior (pre-response) and posterior\n(post-response) states of learners across exercises. Existing methods often\nemploy complex model architectures to update learner states using question and\nresponse records. In this study, we propose a novel perspective on knowledge\ntracing task by treating it as a generative process, consistent with the\nprinciples of autoregressive models. We demonstrate that knowledge states can\nbe directly represented through autoregressive encodings on a question-response\nalternate sequence, where model generate the most probable representation in\nhidden state space by analyzing history interactions. This approach underpins\nour framework, termed Alternate Autoregressive Knowledge Tracing (AAKT).\nAdditionally, we incorporate supplementary educational information, such as\nquestion-related skills, into our framework through an auxiliary task, and\ninclude extra exercise details, like response time, as additional inputs. Our\nproposed framework is implemented using advanced autoregressive technologies\nfrom Natural Language Generation (NLG) for both training and prediction.\nEmpirical evaluations on four real-world KT datasets indicate that AAKT\nconsistently outperforms all baseline models in terms of AUC, ACC, and RMSE.\nFurthermore, extensive ablation studies and visualized analysis validate the\neffectiveness of key components in AAKT.",

Previous research on LRP without\npredefined depots is scant and predominantly relies on heuristic algorithms\nthat iteratively attempt depot placements across a planar area. Such approaches\nlack the ability to proactively generate depot locations that meet specific\ngeographic requirements, revealing a notable gap in current research landscape.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose a data-driven generative DRL framework, designed\nto proactively generate depots for LRP without predefined depot candidates,\nsolely based on customer requests data which include geographic and demand\ninformation. It can operate in two distinct modes: direct generation of exact\ndepot locations, and the creation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution for\nflexible depots sampling. By extracting depots' geographic pattern from\ncustomer requests data, our approach can dynamically respond to logistical\nneeds, identifying high-quality depot locations that further reduce total\nrouting costs compared to traditional methods. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that, for a same group of customer requests, compared with those\ndepots identified through random attempts, our framework can proactively\ngenerate depots that lead to superior solution routes with lower routing cost.\nThe implications of our framework potentially extend into real-world\napplications, particularly in emergency medical rescue and disaster relief\nlogistics, where rapid establishment and adjustment of depot locations are\nparamount, showcasing its potential in addressing LRP for dynamic and\nunpredictable environments.",

Traditional methodologies, which\npredominantly rely on homogeneous graph encoding, are limited by their\ninability to integrate external knowledge and represent molecular structures\nacross different levels of granularity. To address these limitations, we\npropose a paradigm shift by encoding molecular graphs into heterogeneous\nstructures, introducing a novel framework: Knowledge-aware Contrastive\nHeterogeneous Molecular Graph Learning (KCHML). This approach leverages\ncontrastive learning to enrich molecular representations with embedded external\nknowledge. KCHML conceptualizes molecules through three distinct graph\nviews-molecular, elemental, and pharmacological-enhanced by heterogeneous\nmolecular graphs and a dual message-passing mechanism. This design offers a\ncomprehensive representation for property prediction, as well as for downstream\ntasks such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction. Extensive benchmarking\ndemonstrates KCHML's superiority over state-of-the-art molecular property\nprediction models, underscoring its ability to capture intricate molecular\nfeatures.",

Recent studies has demonstrated that more detailed intermediate\nsteps can enhance model performance, yet existing methods for step expansion\neither require more powerful external models or incur substantial computational\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce MathFimer, a novel framework for\nmathematical reasoning step expansion inspired by the \"Fill-in-the-middle\" task\nfrom code completion.

Through comprehensive experiments on\nmultiple mathematical reasoning datasets, including MathInstruct, MetaMathQA\nand etc., we demonstrate that models trained on MathFimer-expanded data\nconsistently outperform their counterparts trained on original data across\nvarious benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.

However, existing datasets and models often fail to\nconsider critical aspects of medical diagnostics, such as the integration of\nhistorical records and the analysis of disease progression over time. In this\npaper, we introduce MMXU (Multimodal and MultiX-ray Understanding), a novel\ndataset for MedVQA that focuses on identifying changes in specific regions\nbetween two patient visits. Unlike previous datasets that primarily address\nsingle-image questions, MMXU enables multi-image questions, incorporating both\ncurrent and historical patient data. We demonstrate the limitations of current\nLVLMs in identifying disease progression on MMXU-\\textit{test}, even those that\nperform well on traditional benchmarks. To address this, we propose a\nMedRecord-Augmented Generation (MAG) approach, incorporating both global and\nregional historical records.

Across 16 datasets covering 9 languages and\n9 domains, 19 annotators achieved an average detection accuracy of 87.6%, thus\nchallenging previous conclusions. We find that major gaps between human and\nmachine text lie in concreteness, cultural nuances, and diversity.

In many practical\napplications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range\nor trajectory of virtual characters.

As a result, the\ngenerated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing\ntrajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining\nfor single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to\ndifferent datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate\ninteractive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples\ncomplex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in\npartner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range\nrefinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a\ntraining-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic\nSynchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models\nto generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's\nmovement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader.\nExperimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging\ntrajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and\naccuracy.",

However, maintaining LLM safety\nthroughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as\nresolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial.\nTypically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related\ncategories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of\nsafety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather\nthan a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive\nsafety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe\nresponses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness.\nTo understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by\ncategorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group\nbehaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between\nsafety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a\nFine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment\neven with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA)\napproach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient\nmasking strategy.

While successors like QwQ,\nDeepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models\ntruly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study\nfound that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance\naccuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for\nthe same questions.

We then compare\nsequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that\nparallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Shortest Majority Vote, a method that combines parallel\nscaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, significantly improving\nmodels' test-time scalability compared to conventional majority voting\napproaches.",

Traditional optimization methods require\nsubstantial computational time and effort due to their reliance on\nresource-intensive simulations, such as finite element analysis, and the\ncomplexity of rigorous optimization algorithms. Data-agnostic AI-based\nsurrogate models, such as Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), offer a\npromising alternative to these conventional simulations, providing drastically\nreduced inference time, unparalleled data efficiency, and zero-shot\nsuper-resolution capability. However, the predictive accuracy of these models\nis often constrained to small, low-dimensional design spaces or systems with\nrelatively simple dynamics.

This new architecture outperforms\nexisting SOTA models, enabling better predictions across broader design spaces.\nLeveraging PIDON's differentiability, we integrate a gradient-based\noptimization approach using the Adam optimizer to efficiently determine optimal\ndesign variables. This forms an end-to-end gradient-based optimization\nframework that accelerates the design process while enhancing scalability and\nefficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in the\noptimization of aerospace-grade composites curing processes achieving a 3x\nspeedup in obtaining optimal design variables compared to gradient-free\nmethods.

Consequently, a key challenge in CL\nis striking a balance between preserving plasticity and mitigating CF. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose the $\\textbf{D}$ecomposed\n$\\textbf{A}$ttention-based $\\textbf{T}$ask $\\textbf{A}$daptation (DATA), which\nexplicitly decouples and learns both task-specific and task-shared knowledge\nusing high-rank and low-rank task adapters (e.g., LoRAs). For new tasks, DATA\ndynamically adjusts the weights of adapters of different ranks based on their\nrelevance and distinction from previous tasks, allowing the model to acquire\nnew task-specific skills while effectively retaining previously learned\nknowledge. Specifically, we implement a decomposed component weighting strategy\ncomprising learnable components that collectively generate attention-based\nweights, allowing the model to integrate and utilize diverse knowledge from\neach DATA. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our\napproach significantly enhances model plasticity and mitigates CF by extending\nlearnable components and employing stochastic restoration during training\niterations.",

Experimental results demonstrate that our\nvariable-frame CNNLSTM method outperforms other approaches across all metrics,\nshowing improvements of 3-6% in F1 score and 1.5% in specificity compared to\nkeyframe methods.

      "abstract": "Pruning offers a promising solution to mitigate the associated costs and\nenvironmental impact of deploying large deep neural networks (DNNs).\nTraditional approaches rely on computationally expensive trained models or\ntime-consuming iterative prune-retrain cycles, undermining their utility in\nresource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we build upon the\nestablished principles of saliency (LeCun et al., 1989) and connection\nsensitivity (Lee et al., 2018) to tackle the challenging problem of one-shot\npruning neural networks (NNs) before training (PBT) at initialization. We\nintroduce Fisher-Taylor Sensitivity (FTS), a computationally cheap and\nefficient pruning criterion based on the empirical Fisher Information Matrix\n(FIM) diagonal, offering a viable alternative for integrating first- and\nsecond-order information to identify a model's structurally important\nparameters. Although the FIM-Hessian equivalency only holds for convergent\nmodels that maximize the likelihood, recent studies (Karakida et al., 2019)\nsuggest that, even at initialization, the FIM captures essential geometric\ninformation of parameters in overparameterized NNs, providing the basis for our\nmethod. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that layer collapse, a critical\nlimitation of data-dependent pruning methodologies, is easily overcome by\npruning within a single training epoch after initialization. We perform\nexperiments on ResNet18 and VGG19 with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, widely used\nbenchmarks in pruning research. Our method achieves competitive performance\nagainst state-of-the-art techniques for one-shot PBT, even under extreme\nsparsity conditions. Our code is made available to the public.",

Once a candidate localization is found, it can be assessed by editing\nthe internal representations at the corresponding localization and checking\nwhether this induces model behavior that is consistent with the semantic\ninterpretation of the localization. The question we address here is: how strong\nis the evidence provided by such edits? To evaluate the localization claim, we\nwant to assess the effect of the optimal intervention at a particular location.\nThe key new technical tool is a way of adapting LLM alignment techniques to\nfind such optimal localized edits. With this tool in hand, we give an example\nwhere the edit-based evidence for localization appears strong, but where\nlocalization clearly fails. Indeed, we find that optimal edits at random\nlocalizations can be as effective as aligning the full model.

However, if the competitor is too strong\nor too weak, the effectiveness of self-play training can be reduced,\nparticularly in complex CO problems. To address this problem, we further\npropose a two-stage self-play strategy to improve the GAZ method~(named TSS GAZ\nPTP). In the first stage, the learning player uses the enhanced policy network\nbased on the Gumbel Monte Carlo Tree Search~(MCTS), and the competitor uses the\nhistorical best trained policy network~(acts as a greedy player). In the second\nstage, we employ Gumbel MCTS for both players, which makes the competition\nfiercer so that both players can continuously learn smarter trajectories. We\nfirst investigate the performance of our proposed TSS GAZ PTP method on TSP\nsince it is also used as a test problem by the original GAZ. The results show\nthe superior performance of TSS GAZ PTP. Then we extend TSS GAZ PTP to deal\nwith multi-constrained Electric Vehicle Routing Problems~(EVRP), which is a\nrecently well-known real application research topic and remains challenging as\na complex CO problem. Impressively, the experimental results show that the TSS\nGAZ PTP outperforms the state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning methods in\nall types of instances tested and outperforms the optimization solver in tested\nlarge-scale instances, indicating the importance and promising of employing\nmore dynamic self-play strategies for complex CO problems.",

We also present YT-Conversation, a diverse\ncollection of in-the-wild conversational videos from YouTube, as a resource for\nlarge-scale pretraining.

In\nthis work, we propose the Zero Token Transformer (ZTT), which features a\nhead-tail decoupled parameter cycling method. We disentangle the first (head)\nand last (tail) layers from parameter cycling and iteratively refine only the\nintermediate layers.

At each cycle, the model retrieves a zero token\n(with trainable key values) from a Zero-Token Pool, integrating it alongside\nregular tokens in the attention mechanism. The corresponding attention scores\nnot only reflect each layer's computational importance but also enable dynamic\nearly exits without sacrificing overall model accuracy. Our approach achieves\nsuperior performance under tight parameter budgets, effectively reduces\ncomputational overhead via early exits, and can be readily applied to fine-tune\nexisting pre-trained models for enhanced efficiency and adaptability.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field\nof autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of\neach individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple\nagents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays,\nthe fusion of information across agents often results in feature\nrepresentations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors.\nDiffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the\nideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to\naddress the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose\nCoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the\npotential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer\nfeature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nto apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception.\nSpecifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of\na powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent\ninformation serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This\nprocess denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused\nfeatures. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets\ndemonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms\nexisting relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection\nperformance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay\ninformation of agents is with high-level noise.

      "abstract": "UAV-View Geo-Localization (UVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged\nsatellite images. However, existing methods heavily rely on pre-paired\nUAV-satellite images for supervised learning. Such dependency not only incurs\nhigh annotation costs but also severely limits scalability and practical\ndeployment in open-world UVGL scenarios. To address these limitations, we\npropose an end-to-end self-supervised UVGL method. Our method leverages a\nshallow backbone network to extract initial features, employs clustering to\ngenerate pseudo labels, and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning\narchitecture to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore,\nour method incorporates two core modules, the dynamic hierarchical memory\nlearning module and the information consistency evolution learning module. The\ndynamic hierarchical memory learning module combines short-term and long-term\nmemory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability.\nMeanwhile, the information consistency evolution learning module leverages a\nneighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture\nimplicit cross-view semantic correlations, thereby improving cross-view feature\nalignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training\nprocess, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced, which refines the\nquality of pseudo supervision. Our method ultimately constructs a unified\ncross-view feature representation space under self-supervised settings.\nExtensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and\neven surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods.

      "abstract": "Despite explicit alignment efforts for large language models (LLMs), they can\nstill be exploited to trigger unintended behaviors, a phenomenon known as\n\"jailbreaking.\" Current jailbreak attack methods mainly focus on discrete\nprompt manipulations targeting closed-source LLMs, relying on manually crafted\nprompt templates and persuasion rules. However, as the capabilities of\nopen-source LLMs improve, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly crucial.\nIn such an environment, the accessibility of model parameters and gradient\ninformation by potential attackers exacerbates the severity of jailbreak\nthreats. To address this research gap, we propose a novel\n\\underline{C}ontext-\\underline{C}oherent \\underline{J}ailbreak\n\\underline{A}ttack (CCJA). We define jailbreak attacks as an optimization\nproblem within the embedding space of masked language models. Through\ncombinatorial optimization, we effectively balance the jailbreak attack success\nrate with semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations show that our method not\nonly maintains semantic consistency but also surpasses state-of-the-art\nbaselines in attack effectiveness. Additionally, by integrating semantically\ncoherent jailbreak prompts generated by our method into widely used black-box\nmethodologies, we observe a notable enhancement in their success rates when\ntargeting closed-source commercial LLMs. This highlights the security threat\nposed by open-source LLMs to commercial counterparts.

      "abstract": "The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions is crucial\nfor their practical applications, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly\nunderstood. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages sparse\nautoencoders (SAE) to interpret how instruction following works in these\nmodels. We demonstrate how the features we identify can effectively steer model\noutputs to align with given instructions. Through analysis of SAE latent\nactivations, we identify specific latents responsible for instruction following\nbehavior. Our findings reveal that instruction following capabilities are\nencoded by a distinct set of instruction-relevant SAE latents. These latents\nboth show semantic proximity to relevant instructions and demonstrate causal\neffects on model behavior. Our research highlights several crucial factors for\nachieving effective steering performance: precise feature identification, the\nrole of final layer, and optimal instruction positioning. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that our methodology scales effectively across SAEs and LLMs of\nvarying sizes.",

      "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated strong capacity in supporting a\nwide variety of applications. Shapley value has emerged as a prominent tool to\nanalyze feature importance to help people understand the inference process of\ndeep neural models. Computing Shapley value function requires choosing a\nbaseline to represent feature's missingness. However, existing random and\nconditional baselines could negatively influence the explanation. In this\npaper, by analyzing the suboptimality of different baselines, we identify the\nproblematic baseline where the asymmetric interaction between $\\bm{x}'_i$ (the\nreplacement of the faithful influential feature) and other features has\nsignificant directional bias toward the model's output, and conclude that\n$p(y|\\bm{x}'_i) = p(y)$ potentially minimizes the asymmetric interaction\ninvolving $\\bm{x}'_i$. We further generalize the uninformativeness of\n$\\bm{x}'_i$ toward the label space $L$ to avoid estimating $p(y)$ and design a\nsimple uncertainty-based reweighting mechanism to accelerate the computation\nprocess. We conduct experiments on various NLP tasks and our quantitative\nanalysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty-based\nreweighting mechanism. Furthermore, by measuring the consistency of\nexplanations generated by explainable methods and human, we highlight the\ndisparity between model inference and human understanding.",

      "abstract": "Inverse generation problems, such as denoising without ground truth\nobservations, is a critical challenge in many scientific inquiries and\nreal-world applications. While recent advances in generative models like\ndiffusion models, conditional flow matching, and consistency models achieved\nimpressive results by casting generation as denoising problems, they cannot be\ndirectly used for inverse generation without access to clean data. Here we\nintroduce Inverse Flow (IF), a novel framework that enables using these\ngenerative models for inverse generation problems including denoising without\nground truth. Inverse Flow can be flexibly applied to nearly any continuous\nnoise distribution and allows complex dependencies. We propose two algorithms\nfor learning Inverse Flows, Inverse Flow Matching (IFM) and Inverse Consistency\nModel (ICM). Notably, to derive the computationally efficient, simulation-free\ninverse consistency model objective, we generalized consistency training to any\nforward diffusion processes or conditional flows, which have applications\nbeyond denoising. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IF on synthetic and real\ndatasets, outperforming prior approaches while enabling noise distributions\nthat previous methods cannot support. Finally, we showcase applications of our\ntechniques to fluorescence microscopy and single-cell genomics data,\nhighlighting IF's utility in scientific problems.

    "abstract": "We present ASTRA (A} Scene-aware TRAnsformer-based model for trajectory\nprediction), a light-weight pedestrian trajectory forecasting model that\nintegrates the scene context, spatial dynamics, social inter-agent interactions\nand temporal progressions for precise forecasting. We utilised a U-Net-based\nfeature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene\nrepresentations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social\ninteractions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware\nembedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future\ntrajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic\nand stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by\nincorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also\nproposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to\nyield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art\ndeterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement\nof 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26%\nimprovement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer\nparameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1).\nAdditionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different\nperspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in complex\ndomains, however, the inherent black box nature of deep neural network policies\nraises significant challenges in understanding and trusting the decision-making\nprocesses. While existing explainable RL methods provide local insights, they\nfail to deliver a global understanding of the model, particularly in\nhigh-stakes applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel\nmodel-agnostic approach that bridges the gap between explainability and\ninterpretability by leveraging Shapley values to transform complex deep RL\npolicies into transparent representations. The proposed approach offers two key\ncontributions: a novel approach employing Shapley values to policy\ninterpretation beyond local explanations and a general framework applicable to\noff-policy and on-policy algorithms. We evaluate our approach with three\nexisting deep RL algorithms and validate its performance in two classic control\nenvironments. The results demonstrate that our approach not only preserves the\noriginal models' performance but also generates more stable interpretable\npolicies.",

These\nheterogeneous inputs offer significant opportunities for scene understanding\nbut present challenges in interpreting geometry accurately, particularly in the\nabsence of precise ground truth data. To address this, we propose\nCrossModalityDiffusion, a modular framework designed to generate images across\ndifferent modalities and viewpoints without prior knowledge of scene geometry.\nCrossModalityDiffusion employs modality-specific encoders that take multiple\ninput images and produce geometry-aware feature volumes that encode scene\nstructure relative to their input camera positions.

    "abstract": "Visual tokenization via auto-encoding empowers state-of-the-art image and\nvideo generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space. Although\nscaling Transformer-based generators has been central to recent advances, the\ntokenizer component itself is rarely scaled, leaving open questions about how\nauto-encoder design choices influence both its objective of reconstruction and\ndownstream generative performance. Our work aims to conduct an exploration of\nscaling in auto-encoders to fill in this blank. To facilitate this exploration,\nwe replace the typical convolutional backbone with an enhanced Vision\nTransformer architecture for Tokenization (ViTok). We train ViTok on\nlarge-scale image and video datasets far exceeding ImageNet-1K, removing data\nconstraints on tokenizer scaling. We first study how scaling the auto-encoder\nbottleneck affects both reconstruction and generation -- and find that while it\nis highly correlated with reconstruction, its relationship with generation is\nmore complex. We next explored the effect of separately scaling the\nauto-encoders' encoder and decoder on reconstruction and generation\nperformance. Crucially, we find that scaling the encoder yields minimal gains\nfor either reconstruction or generation, while scaling the decoder boosts\nreconstruction but the benefits for generation are mixed. Building on our\nexploration, we design ViTok as a lightweight auto-encoder that achieves\ncompetitive performance with state-of-the-art auto-encoders on ImageNet-1K and\nCOCO reconstruction tasks (256p and 512p) while outperforming existing\nauto-encoders on 16-frame 128p video reconstruction for UCF-101, all with 2-5x\nfewer FLOPs. When integrated with Diffusion Transformers, ViTok demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and sets new\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks for class-conditional video generation on UCF-101.",

Therefore, under such a\nsetting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a\npre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as\ncontinual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted\nknowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining\nknowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal.\n(iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially\nmissing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose\nGroup Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce LoRA\nmodules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting\ntask independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is\nadopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out\nthe others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we\nincorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a\nmore practical approach, GS-LoRA++. For each forgotten class, we move the\nlogits away from its original prototype. For the remaining classes, we pull the\nlogits closer to their respective prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments\non face recognition, object detection and image classification and demonstrate\nthat our method manages to forget specific classes with minimal impact on other\nclasses.

    "abstract": "Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning.\nThe breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant\nresearch interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks.\nResearchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by\nintroducing the concept of \"thought\" -- a sequence of tokens representing\nintermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables\nLLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and\nreflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has\napplied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning\nprocesses. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality\nreasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly\nexpanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training\ndata. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to \"think\"\nwith more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost\nreasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to\nshow a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The\nintroduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this\nresearch direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent\nprogress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background\nof LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development\nof large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction,\nlearning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling.

    "abstract": "This tutorial provides an in-depth guide on inference-time guidance and\nalignment methods for optimizing downstream reward functions in diffusion\nmodels. While diffusion models are renowned for their generative modeling\ncapabilities, practical applications in fields such as biology often require\nsample generation that maximizes specific metrics (e.g., stability, affinity in\nproteins, closeness to target structures). In these scenarios, diffusion models\ncan be adapted not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly\nmaximize desired measures at inference time without fine-tuning. This tutorial\nexplores the foundational aspects of such inference-time algorithms. We review\nthese methods from a unified perspective, demonstrating that current techniques\n-- such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based guidance, value-based sampling,\nand classifier guidance -- aim to approximate soft optimal denoising processes\n(a.k.a. policies in RL) that combine pre-trained denoising processes with value\nfunctions serving as look-ahead functions that predict from intermediate states\nto terminal rewards. Within this framework, we present several novel algorithms\nnot yet covered in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss (1) fine-tuning\nmethods combined with inference-time techniques, (2) inference-time algorithms\nbased on search algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search, which have received\nlimited attention in current research, and (3) connections between\ninference-time algorithms in language models and diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Humans learn about the world, and how to act in the world, in many ways: from\nindividually conducting experiments to observing and reproducing others'\nbehavior. Different learning strategies come with different costs and\nlikelihoods of successfully learning more about the world. The choice that any\none individual makes of how to learn can have an impact on the collective\nunderstanding of a whole population if people learn from each other. Alan\nRogers developed simulations of a population of agents to study these network\nphenomena where agents could individually or socially learn amidst a dynamic,\nuncertain world and uncovered a confusing result: the availability of cheap\nsocial learning yielded no benefit to population fitness over individual\nlearning. This paradox spawned decades of work trying to understand and uncover\nfactors that foster the relative benefit of social learning that centuries of\nhuman behavior suggest exists. What happens in such network models now that\nhumans can socially learn from AI systems that are themselves socially learning\nfrom us? We revisit Rogers' Paradox in the context of human-AI interaction to\nprobe a simplified network of humans and AI systems learning together about an\nuncertain world. We propose and examine the impact of several learning\nstrategies on the quality of the equilibrium of a society's 'collective world\nmodel'. We consider strategies that can be undertaken by various stakeholders\ninvolved in a single human-AI interaction: human, AI model builder, and society\nor regulators around the interaction. We then consider possible negative\nfeedback loops that may arise from humans learning socially from AI: that\nlearning from the AI may impact our own ability to learn about the world. We\nclose with open directions into studying networks of human and AI systems that\ncan be explored in enriched versions of our simulation framework.",

    "abstract": "Planning for autonomous systems typically requires reasoning with models at\ndifferent levels of abstraction, and the harmonization of two competing sets of\nobjectives: high-level mission goals that refer to an interaction of the system\nwith the external environment, and low-level platform constraints that aim to\npreserve the integrity and the correct interaction of the subsystems. The\ncomplicated interplay between these two models makes it very hard to reason on\nthe system as a whole, especially when the objective is to find plans with\nrobustness guarantees, considering the non-deterministic behavior of the lower\nlayers of the system.\n  In this paper, we introduce the problem of Platform-Aware Mission Planning\n(PAMP), addressing it in the setting of temporal durative actions. The PAMP\nproblem differs from standard temporal planning for its exists-forall nature:\nthe high-level plan dealing with mission goals is required to satisfy safety\nand executability constraints, for all the possible non-deterministic\nexecutions of the low-level model of the platform and the environment. We\npropose two approaches for solving PAMP. The first baseline approach\namalgamates the mission and platform levels, while the second is based on an\nabstraction-refinement loop that leverages the combination of a planner and a\nverification engine. We prove the soundness and completeness of the proposed\napproaches and validate them experimentally, demonstrating the importance of\nheterogeneous modeling and the superiority of the technique based on\nabstraction-refinement.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in healthcare\ndelivery, this chapter explores the critical aspects of developing reliable and\nethical Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Beginning with the\nfundamental transition from traditional statistical models to sophisticated\nmachine learning approaches, this work examines rigorous validation strategies\nand performance assessment methods, including the crucial role of model\ncalibration and decision curve analysis. The chapter emphasizes that creating\ntrustworthy AI systems in healthcare requires more than just technical\naccuracy; it demands careful consideration of fairness, explainability, and\nprivacy. The challenge of ensuring equitable healthcare delivery through AI is\nstressed, discussing methods to identify and mitigate bias in clinical\npredictive models. The chapter then delves into explainability as a cornerstone\nof human-centered CDSS. This focus reflects the understanding that healthcare\nprofessionals must not only trust AI recommendations but also comprehend their\nunderlying reasoning. The discussion advances in an analysis of privacy\nvulnerabilities in medical AI systems, from data leakage in deep learning\nmodels to sophisticated attacks against model explanations. The text explores\nprivacy-preservation strategies such as differential privacy and federated\nlearning, while acknowledging the inherent trade-offs between privacy\nprotection and model performance. This progression, from technical validation\nto ethical considerations, reflects the multifaceted challenges of developing\nAI systems that can be seamlessly and reliably integrated into daily clinical\npractice while maintaining the highest standards of patient care and data\nprotection.",

IFRA, which stands\nfor Instrumented Fall Risk Assessment, has been developed using a two-step\nprocess: first, features with the highest predictive power among those\ncollected in a ITUG test have been identified using machine learning\ntechniques; then, a strategy is proposed to stratify patients into low, medium,\nor high-risk strata.

Features considered in the IFRA scale include gait\nspeed, vertical acceleration during sit-to-walk transition, and turning angular\nvelocity, which align well with established literature on the risk of fall in\nneurological patients. In a comparison with traditional clinical scales such as\nthe traditional Timed Up & Go and the Mini-BESTest, IFRA demonstrates\ncompetitive performance, being the only scale to correctly assign more than\nhalf of the fallers to the high-risk stratum (Fischer's Exact test p = 0.004).\nDespite the dataset's limited size, this is the first proof-of-concept study to\npave the way for future evidence regarding the use of IFRA tool for continuous\npatient monitoring and fall prevention both in clinical stroke rehabilitation\nand at home post-discharge.",

To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven\nAdaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with\nminimal paired image-label data.\n  Methods: Our approach has two key components. First, Few-shot selection-based\nmodality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings\nwith text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap.\nSecond, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder,\neliminating the need for paired image-text data. This decoder is then applied\nto aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit\nimage-text pairs.\n  Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and\ndiscriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition). Results show\nthat Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream\ntasks.\n  Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the\nmodality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow\nanalysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets.

Even though LLMs like\nChatGPT have impressive abilities, they struggle to understand different\ncultural contexts and engage in meaningful, human like conversations. A key\nissue is that biases in language processing, especially in machine translation,\ncan reinforce inequality. Tackling these biases requires a multidisciplinary\napproach to ensure AI promotes diversity, fairness, and inclusion. We also\nhighlight AI's role in identifying biased content in media, which is important\nfor improving representation. By detecting unequal portrayals of social groups,\nAI can help challenge stereotypes and create more inclusive technologies.\nTransparent AI algorithms, which clearly explain their decisions, are essential\nfor building trust and reducing bias in AI systems. We also stress AI systems\nneed diverse and inclusive training data. Projects like the Child Growth\nMonitor show how using a wide range of data can help address real world\nproblems like malnutrition and poverty. We present a project that demonstrates\nhow AI can be applied to monitor the role of search engines in spreading\ndisinformation about the LGBTQ+ community.

Furthermore, a parallel edge\noffloading scheme is implemented to distribute these blocks across multiple\nedge servers for concurrent processing. Experimental evaluations show that\nRE-POSE significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces inference\nlatency, surpassing existing methods.",

    "abstract": "One of the most widely used methods to evaluate LLMs are Multiple Choice\nQuestion (MCQ) tests. MCQ benchmarks enable the testing of LLM knowledge on\nalmost any topic at scale as the results can be processed automatically. To\nhelp the LLM answer, a few examples called few shots can be included in the\nprompt. Moreover, the LLM can be asked to answer the question directly with the\nselected option or to first provide the reasoning and then the selected answer,\nwhich is known as chain of thought. In addition to checking whether the\nselected answer is correct, the evaluation can look at the LLM-estimated\nprobability of its response as an indication of the confidence of the LLM in\nthe response. In this paper, we study how the LLM confidence in its answer\ndepends on whether the model has been asked to answer directly or to provide\nthe reasoning before answering. The results of the evaluation of questions on a\nwide range of topics in seven different models show that LLMs are more\nconfident in their answers when they provide reasoning before the answer. This\noccurs regardless of whether the selected answer is correct. Our hypothesis is\nthat this behavior is due to the reasoning that modifies the probability of the\nselected answer, as the LLM predicts the answer based on the input question and\nthe reasoning that supports the selection made. Therefore, LLM estimated\nprobabilities seem to have intrinsic limitations that should be understood in\norder to use them in evaluation procedures. Interestingly, the same behavior\nhas been observed in humans, for whom explaining an answer increases confidence\nin its correctness.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges translating case law under Hong Kong's\nbilingual legal system. It highlights the initial success of translating all\nwritten statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the\nBasic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal,\nlinguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and\nculturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law\nremains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth\nof judicial decisions. The paper critiques the governments and judiciarys\nsporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with\nthe thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the\ngovernment acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a\nsustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciarys position that\ntranslating all judgments is unnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effectiveis\nanalyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A\nproposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a\nhuman-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major\ntransitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to\nusing a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it\nevolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating\nTranslator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach,\nsupported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of\njudicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and\ncontinuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual\nlegal system.",

However, ABMs have long suffered from the Lucas\ncritique, stating that agent behaviour should adapt to environmental changes.\nFurthermore, the environment itself often adapts to these behavioural changes,\ncreating a complex bi-level adaptation problem. Recent progress integrating\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning into ABMs introduces adaptive agent\nbehaviour, beginning to address the first part of this critique, however, the\napproaches are still relatively ad hoc, lacking a general formulation, and\nfurthermore, do not tackle the second aspect of simultaneously adapting\nenvironmental level characteristics in addition to the agent behaviours. In\nthis work, we develop a generic two-layer framework for ADaptive AGEnt based\nmodelling (ADAGE) for addressing these problems. This framework formalises the\nbi-level problem as a Stackelberg game with conditional behavioural policies,\nproviding a consolidated framework for adaptive agent-based modelling based on\nsolving a coupled set of non-linear equations. We demonstrate how this generic\napproach encapsulates several common (previously viewed as distinct) ABM tasks,\nsuch as policy design, calibration, scenario generation, and robust behavioural\nlearning under one unified framework.

However, the problem becomes more\ncomplex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each\nmodel's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of\ndifferent models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for\nthe joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a\nframework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade\nusing continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds\nusing grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves\nruntime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired\nresolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into\nlow-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our\ncontinuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via\ngrid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error\ncurve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models.\nOverall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM\ncascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in\nanalyzing LLM systems.",

    "abstract": "We present a simple approach to make pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs)\ninterpretable for fine-grained analysis, aiming to identify and localize the\ntraits that distinguish visually similar categories, such as bird species.\nPre-trained ViTs, such as DINO, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nextracting localized, discriminative features. However, saliency maps like\nGrad-CAM often fail to identify these traits, producing blurred, coarse\nheatmaps that highlight entire objects instead. We propose a novel approach,\nPrompt Class Attention Map (Prompt-CAM), to address this limitation. Prompt-CAM\nlearns class-specific prompts for a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding\noutputs for classification. To correctly classify an image, the true-class\nprompt must attend to unique image patches not present in other classes' images\n(i.e., traits). As a result, the true class's multi-head attention maps reveal\ntraits and their locations. Implementation-wise, Prompt-CAM is almost a ``free\nlunch,'' requiring only a modification to the prediction head of Visual Prompt\nTuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM easy to train and apply, in stark contrast\nto other interpretable methods that require designing specific models and\ntraining processes. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from\nvarious domains (e.g., birds, fishes, insects, fungi, flowers, food, and cars)\nvalidate the superior interpretation capability of Prompt-CAM.

    "abstract": "A key challenge in training Large Language Models (LLMs) is properly aligning\nthem with human preferences. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)\nuses pairwise comparisons from human annotators to train reward functions and\nhas emerged as a popular alignment method. However, input datasets in RLHF are\nnot necessarily balanced in the types of questions and answers that are\nincluded. Therefore, we want RLHF algorithms to perform well even when the set\nof alternatives is not uniformly distributed. Drawing on insights from social\nchoice theory, we introduce robustness to approximate clones, a desirable\nproperty of RLHF algorithms which requires that adding near-duplicate\nalternatives does not significantly change the learned reward function. We\nfirst demonstrate that the standard RLHF algorithm based on regularized maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) fails to satisfy this property. We then propose the\nweighted MLE, a new RLHF algorithm that modifies the standard regularized MLE\nby weighting alternatives based on their similarity to other alternatives. This\nnew algorithm guarantees robustness to approximate clones while preserving\ndesirable theoretical properties.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of digital services, a large volume of personally\nidentifiable information (PII) is stored online and is subject to cyberattacks\nsuch as Identity fraud. Most recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nenabled deep fake technologies has significantly increased the complexity of\nidentity fraud. Fraudsters may use these technologies to create highly\nsophisticated counterfeit personal identification documents, photos and videos.\nThese advancements in the identity fraud landscape pose challenges for identity\nfraud detection and society at large. There is a pressing need to review and\nunderstand identity fraud detection methods, their limitations and potential\nsolutions. This research aims to address this important need by using the\nwell-known systematic literature review method. This paper reviewed a selected\nset of 43 papers across 4 major academic literature databases. In particular,\nthe review results highlight the two types of identity fraud prevention and\ndetection methods, in-depth and open challenges. The results were also\nconsolidated into a taxonomy of AI-based identity fraud detection and\nprevention methods including key insights and trends. Overall, this paper\nprovides a foundational knowledge base to researchers and practitioners for\nfurther research and development in this important area of digital identity\nfraud.",

    "abstract": "Accurate molecular quantification is essential for advancing research and\ndiagnostics in fields such as infectious diseases, cancer biology, and genetic\ndisorders. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a gold standard for\nachieving absolute quantification. While computational ddPCR technologies have\nadvanced significantly, achieving automatic interpretation and consistent\nadaptability across diverse operational environments remains a challenge. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce the intelligent interpretable droplet\ndigital PCR (I2ddPCR) assay, a comprehensive framework integrating front-end\npredictive models (for droplet segmentation and classification) with GPT-4o\nmultimodal large language model (MLLM, for context-aware explanations and\nrecommendations) to automate and enhance ddPCR image analysis. This approach\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art models, affording 99.05% accuracy in processing\ncomplex ddPCR images containing over 300 droplets per image with varying\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By combining specialized neural networks and\nlarge language models, the I2ddPCR assay offers a robust and adaptable solution\nfor absolute molecular quantification, achieving a sensitivity capable of\ndetecting low-abundance targets as low as 90.32 copies/{\\mu}L. Furthermore, it\nimproves model's transparency through detailed explanation and troubleshooting\nguidance, empowering users to make informed decisions. This innovative\nframework has the potential to benefit molecular diagnostics, disease research,\nand clinical applications, especially in resource-constrained settings.",

However,\ntraditional TSC methods often struggle with the inherent complexity and\nvariability of time series data. Building on our previous work with the linear\nlaw-based transformation (LLT) - which improved classification accuracy by\ntransforming the feature space based on key data patterns - we introduce\nadaptive law-based transformation (ALT). ALT enhances LLT by incorporating\nvariable-length shifted time windows, enabling it to capture distinguishing\npatterns of various lengths and thereby handle complex time series more\neffectively. By mapping features into a linearly separable space, ALT provides\na fast, robust, and transparent solution that achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with only a few hyperparameters.",

    "abstract": "Visual object tracking is a crucial research topic in the fields of computer\nvision and multi-modal fusion. Among various approaches, robust visual tracking\nthat combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention\nfrom researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking,\nit is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks\nand defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area\nremains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\ncross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because\nof the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels\nand frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two\nrepresentations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel,\nwe first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame\nadversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a\ntwo-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the\ntarget region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a\ngradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event\nvoxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal\nuniversal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal\ndata. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used\nRGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method significantly reduces the performance of the\ntracker across numerous datasets in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

    "abstract": "The internet is undergoing a historical transformation from the \"Internet of\nWebsites\" to the \"Internet of AgentSites.\" While traditional Websites served as\nthe foundation for information hosting and dissemination, a new frontier is\nemerging where AgentSites serve as the hubs of the internet, where each\nAgentSite hosts one or more AI agents that receive tasks, address them, and\ndeliver actionable solutions, marking a significant shift in the digital\nlandscape and representing the next generation of online ecosystems. Under this\nvision, AIOS, the AI Agent Operating System, serves as the server for the\ndevelopment, deployment and execution of AI agents, which is a fundamental\ninfrastructure for the Internet of Agentsites.\n  In this paper, we introduce AIOS Server, a runtime framework to host agents\nand enable global-scale collaboration among decentralized agents. AIOS Server\nprovides a communication protocol leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\nand JSON-RPC to enable agent-agent or human-agent interactions. Each AIOS node\noperates as a server to host and execute agents, while supporting peer-to-peer\ncoordination without reliance on centralized orchestration. Based on AIOS\nServer, we further present the world's first practically deployed Internet of\nAgentsites (AIOS-IoA), including AgentHub for agent registration and discovery\nand AgentChat for interactive communication, at https://planet.aios.foundation.\nThe agent discovery mechanism based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) and a\nGossip protocol serves as the search engine for the internet of agentsites.\nThis work provides a practical foundation for building the Internet of\nAgentsites-a new paradigm where autonomous agents become first-class citizens\nof the web.

We introduce \\textbf{Hydra}, an adaptive agentic framework that\nenhances plug-in VLMs through iterative reasoning, structured critiques, and\ncross-model verification, improving both resilience to adversarial\nperturbations and intrinsic model errors. Hydra employs an Action-Critique\nLoop, where it retrieves and critiques visual information, leveraging\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques to refine\noutputs dynamically. Unlike static post-hoc correction methods, Hydra adapts to\nboth adversarial manipulations and intrinsic model errors, making it robust to\nmalicious perturbations and hallucination-related inaccuracies. We evaluate\nHydra on four VLMs, three hallucination benchmarks, two adversarial attack\nstrategies, and two adversarial defense methods, assessing performance on both\nclean and adversarial inputs. Results show that Hydra surpasses plug-in VLMs\nand state-of-the-art (SOTA) dehallucination methods, even without explicit\nadversarial defenses, demonstrating enhanced robustness and factual\nconsistency.

While absolute positional embeddings (APE)\nhave shown theoretical advantages over relative positional embeddings (RPE),\nparticularly due to the ability of sinusoidal functions to preserve spatial\ninductive biases like monotonicity and shift invariance, a fundamental\nchallenge arises when mapping a 2D grid to a 1D sequence. Existing methods have\nmostly overlooked or never explored the impact of patch ordering in positional\nembeddings. To address this, we propose LOOPE, a learnable patch-ordering\nmethod that optimizes spatial representation for a given set of frequencies,\nproviding a principled approach to patch order optimization. Empirical results\nshow that our PE significantly improves classification accuracy across various\nViT architectures. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of positional\nembeddings, we introduce the \"Three Cell Experiment\", a novel benchmarking\nframework that assesses the ability of PEs to retain relative and absolute\npositional information across different ViT architectures. Unlike standard\nevaluations, which typically report a performance gap of 4 to 6% between models\nwith and without PE, our method reveals a striking 30 to 35% difference,\noffering a more sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the efficacy of PEs.

Extensive experiments on both\ntransformer-based and recurrence-based state space foundation models (SSMs)\ndemonstrate that FLOW outperforms existing alternatives with an accuracy\nimprovement of up to 36%, while FlexCiM achieves up to 1.75x lower inference\nlatency and 1.5x lower energy consumption compared to existing sparse\naccelerators.

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the remarkable potential of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in test-time scaling. By making models think before answering,\nthey are able to achieve much higher accuracy with extra inference computation.\nHowever, in many real-world scenarios, models are used under time constraints,\nwhere an answer should be given within a certain output length. It is unclear\nwhether and how the reasoning ability of different LLMs remain effective under\nstrict constraints. We take a first look at this problem by conducting an\nin-depth empirical study. Specifically, we test 30 LLMs on common reasoning\ndatasets under a wide range of output length budgets, and we analyze the\ncorrelation between the inference accuracy and various properties including\nmodel type, model size, prompt style, etc. We also consider the mappings\nbetween token budgets and actual on-device latency budgets. The results have\ndemonstrated several interesting findings regarding the budget-aware LLM\nreasoning ability that differ from the unconstrained situation, e.g. the\noptimal choices of either model size or prompt style change under different\nbudgets. These findings offer timely evaluation to this area and practical\nguidance for users to deploy LLMs under real-world latency constraints.",

To achieve this,\nprior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent\nnoise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the\nuser-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM\ninversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from\naccurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content\nconsistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method\neliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel\nperspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency\nmodels that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence\nof content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS)\nto ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the\nsource frames.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of video surveillance systems for object detection,\ntracking, activity recognition, and anomaly detection has revolutionized our\nday-to-day lives while setting alarms for privacy concerns. It isn't easy to\nstrike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in\nmost computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without\nsacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy\nenhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that\noptimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring\nimproved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy\nleakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy\nleakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is\nprimarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and\nGDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while\nmaintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first\nto introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the\naction features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.

Existing RM\nconstruction methods often rely on precise environmental data and base station\n(BS) locations, which are not always available in dynamic or privacy-sensitive\nenvironments. While sparse measurement techniques reduce data collection, the\nimpact of noise in sparse data on RM accuracy is not well understood. This\npaper addresses these challenges by formulating RM construction as a Bayesian\ninverse problem under coarse environmental knowledge and noisy sparse\nmeasurements. Although maximum a posteriori (MAP) filtering offers an optimal\nsolution, it requires a precise prior distribution of the RM, which is\ntypically unavailable. To solve this, we propose RadioDiff-Inverse, a\ndiffusion-enhanced Bayesian inverse estimation framework that uses an\nunconditional generative diffusion model to learn the RM prior. This approach\nnot only reconstructs the spatial distribution of wireless channel features but\nalso enables environmental structure perception, such as building outlines, and\nlocation of BS just relay on pathloss, through integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC). Remarkably, RadioDiff-Inverse is training-free,\nleveraging a pre-trained model from Imagenet without task-specific fine-tuning,\nwhich significantly reduces the training cost of using generative large model\nin wireless networks. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioDiff-Inverse\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy of RM construction and\nenvironmental reconstruction, and robustness against noisy sparse sampling.",

    "abstract": "This paper attempts to explore human identity by utilizing neural networks in\nan indirect manner. For this exploration, we adopt diffusion models,\nstate-of-the-art AI generative models trained to create human face images. By\nrelating the generated human face to human identity, we establish a\ncorrespondence between the face image generation process of the diffusion model\nand the process of human identity formation. Through experiments with the\ndiffusion model, we observe that changes in its external input result in\nsignificant changes in the generated face image. Based on the correspondence,\nwe indirectly confirm the dependence of human identity on external factors in\nthe process of human identity formation. Furthermore, we introduce\n\\textit{Fluidity of Human Identity}, a video artwork that expresses the fluid\nnature of human identity affected by varying external factors.

However,\nexisting methods lack the flexibility for precise topology control, limiting\nnavigation of the backbone space. We present ProtPainter, a diffusion-based\napproach for generating protein backbones conditioned on 3D curves. ProtPainter\nfollows a two-stage process: curve-based sketching and sketch-guided backbone\ngeneration. For the first stage, we propose CurveEncoder, which predicts\nsecondary structure annotations from a curve to parametrize sketch generation.\nFor the second stage, the sketch guides the generative process in Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Modeling (DDPM) to generate backbones. During this\nprocess, we further introduce a fusion scheduling scheme, Helix-Gating, to\ncontrol the scaling factors. To evaluate, we propose the first benchmark for\ntopology-conditioned protein generation, introducing Protein Restoration Task\nand a new metric, self-consistency Topology Fitness (scTF). Experiments\ndemonstrate ProtPainter's ability to generate topology-fit (scTF > 0.8) and\ndesignable (scTM > 0.5) backbones, with drawing and dragging tasks showcasing\nits flexibility and versatility.",

There have been extensive\nsuccessful works in this area. However, these approaches focus only on\nmodelling the flow transition and ignore the flow generation process, which\nmanifests itself in two ways: (i) The models are based on Markovian\nassumptions, ignoring the multi-periodicity of the flow generation in nodes.\n(ii) The same structure is designed to encode both the transition and\ngeneration processes, ignoring the differences between them. To address these\nproblems, we propose an Effective Multi-Branch Similarity Transformer for\nTraffic Flow Prediction, namely EMBSFormer. Through data analysis, we find that\nthe factors affecting traffic flow include node-level traffic generation and\ngraph-level traffic transition, which describe the multi-periodicity and\ninteraction pattern of nodes, respectively. Specifically, to capture traffic\ngeneration patterns, we propose a similarity analysis module that supports\nmulti-branch encoding to dynamically expand significant cycles. For traffic\ntransition, we employ a temporal and spatial self-attention mechanism to\nmaintain global node interactions, and use GNN and time conv to model local\nnode interactions, respectively. Model performance is evaluated on three\nreal-world datasets on both long-term and short-term prediction tasks.\nExperimental results show that EMBSFormer outperforms baselines on both tasks.\nMoreover, compared to models based on flow transition modelling (e.g. GMAN,\n513k), the variant of EMBSFormer(93K) only uses 18\\% of the parameters,\nachieving the same performance.",

Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with\nencouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed\nreasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently\nrobust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing\nagents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit\nreasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and\nerror recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from\nreactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate\nthis transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed\nthrough our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training\napproach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to\nDeliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on\nestablishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to\ntransfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to\nMLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to\nintegrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action\ngeneration. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic\nreasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage\nintroduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for\ngenerating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario\nConstruction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from\nidentified prone-to-error steps.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for ID-preserving generation using a multi-modal\nencoding strategy rather than injecting identity features via adapters into\npre-trained models. Our method treats identity and text as a unified\nconditioning input. To achieve this, we introduce FaceCLIP, a multi-modal\nencoder that learns a joint embedding space for both identity and textual\nsemantics. Given a reference face and a text prompt, FaceCLIP produces a\nunified representation that encodes both identity and text, which conditions a\nbase diffusion model to generate images that are identity-consistent and\ntext-aligned. We also present a multi-modal alignment algorithm to train\nFaceCLIP, using a loss that aligns its joint representation with face, text,\nand image embedding spaces. We then build FaceCLIP-SDXL, an ID-preserving image\nsynthesis pipeline by integrating FaceCLIP with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL).\nCompared to prior methods, FaceCLIP-SDXL enables photorealistic portrait\ngeneration with better identity preservation and textual relevance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate its quantitative and qualitative superiority.",

However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high\ncomputational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small\nand representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support\nset samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary\ninformation loss. These methods may also be less effective for image\nclassification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations,\nwe propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that\nleverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We\nintroduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor\nfor identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies.\nBy leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of\nselected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve\ninto a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive\nexperiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image\nclassification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\\%.\nNotably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong\nperformance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework\nfor resource-constrained real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Matching candidate news with user interests is crucial for personalized news\nrecommendations. Most existing methods can represent a user's reading interests\nthrough a single profile based on clicked news, which may not fully capture the\ndiversity of user interests. Although some approaches incorporate candidate\nnews or topic information, they remain insufficient because they neglect the\nmulti-granularity relatedness between candidate news and user interests. To\naddress this, this study proposed a multi-granularity candidate-aware user\nmodeling framework that integrated user interest features across various levels\nof granularity. It consisted of two main components: candidate news encoding\nand user modeling. A news textual information extractor and a\nknowledge-enhanced entity information extractor can capture candidate news\nfeatures, and word-level, entity-level, and news-level candidate-aware\nmechanisms can provide a comprehensive representation of user interests.\nExtensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed\nmodel could significantly outperform baseline models.",

    "abstract": "Determining the ideal architecture for deep learning models, such as the\nnumber of layers and neurons, is a difficult and resource-intensive process\nthat frequently relies on human tuning or computationally costly optimization\napproaches. While Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have been individually applied in optimization and deep learning, their\ncombined use for enhancing convergence in numerical optimization tasks remains\nunderexplored. Our work addresses this gap by integrating LLMs into PSO to\nreduce model evaluations and improve convergence for deep learning\nhyperparameter tuning. The proposed LLM-enhanced PSO method addresses the\ndifficulties of efficiency and convergence by using LLMs (particularly\nChatGPT-3.5 and Llama3) to improve PSO performance, allowing for faster\nachievement of target objectives. Our method speeds up search space exploration\nby substituting underperforming particle placements with best suggestions\noffered by LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across three scenarios -- (1)\noptimizing the Rastrigin function, (2) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetworks for time series regression, and (3) using Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) for material classification -- show that the method\nsignificantly improves convergence rates and lowers computational costs.\nDepending on the application, computational complexity is lowered by 20% to 60%\ncompared to traditional PSO methods. Llama3 achieved a 20% to 40% reduction in\nmodel calls for regression tasks, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 reduced model calls by\n60% for both regression and classification tasks, all while preserving accuracy\nand error rates. This groundbreaking methodology offers a very efficient and\neffective solution for optimizing deep learning models, leading to substantial\ncomputational performance improvements across a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Following the initial excitement, Text-to-Image (TTI) models are now being\nexamined more critically. While much of the discourse has focused on biases and\nstereotypes embedded in large-scale training datasets, the sociotechnical\ndynamics of user interactions with these models remain underexplored. This\nstudy examines the linguistic and semantic choices users make when crafting\nprompts and how these choices influence the diversity of generated outputs.\nAnalyzing over six million prompts from the Civiverse dataset on the CivitAI\nplatform across seven months, we categorize users into three groups based on\ntheir levels of linguistic experimentation: consistent repeaters, occasional\nrepeaters, and non-repeaters. Our findings reveal that as user participation\ngrows over time, prompt language becomes increasingly homogenized through the\nadoption of popular community tags and descriptors, with repeated prompts\ncomprising 40-50% of submissions. At the same time, semantic similarity and\ntopic preferences remain relatively stable, emphasizing common subjects and\nsurface aesthetics. Using Vendi scores to quantify visual diversity, we\ndemonstrate a clear correlation between lexical similarity in prompts and the\nvisual similarity of generated images, showing that linguistic repetition\nreinforces less diverse representations. These findings highlight the\nsignificant role of user-driven factors in shaping AI-generated imagery, beyond\ninherent model biases, and underscore the need for tools and practices that\nencourage greater linguistic and thematic experimentation within TTI systems to\nfoster more inclusive and diverse AI-generated content.",

It requires a small number of additional learnable\nparameters while significantly enhancing performance on target tasks. However,\nmost existing methods suffer from overfitting to fine-tuning data, yielding\npoor generalizability. To address this, we propose a new training objective\nfunction based on a Bayesian learning principle to balance adaptability and\ngeneralizability. We derive a prior over the logits, where the mean function is\nparameterized by the pre-trained model, while the posterior corresponds to the\nfine-tuned model. This objective establishes a balance by allowing the\nfine-tuned model to adapt to downstream tasks while remaining close to the\npre-trained model.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is\ncrucial for enabling them to tackle complex, multi-step problems. Multi-agent\nframeworks have shown great potential in enhancing LLMs' reasoning\ncapabilities. However, the lack of effective cooperation between LLM agents\nhinders their performance, especially for multi-step reasoning tasks. This\npaper proposes a novel cooperative multi-agent reasoning framework (CoPlanner)\nby separating reasoning steps and assigning distinct duties to different\nagents. CoPlanner consists of two LLM agents: a planning agent and a reasoning\nagent. The planning agent provides high-level strategic hints, while the\nreasoning agent follows these hints and infers answers. By training the\nplanning agent's policy through the interactive reasoning process via Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), the LLaMA-3-8B-based CoPlanner outperforms the\nprevious best method by 9.94\\% on LogiQA and 3.09\\% on BBH. Our results\ndemonstrate that the guidance from the planning agent and the effective\ncooperation between the agents contribute to the superior performance of\nCoPlanner in tackling multi-step reasoning problems.",

    "abstract": "Energy arbitrage is one of the most profitable sources of income for battery\noperators, generating revenues by buying and selling electricity at different\nprices. Forecasting these revenues is challenging due to the inherent\nuncertainty of electricity prices. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerged in\nrecent years as a promising tool, able to cope with uncertainty by training on\nlarge quantities of historical data. However, without access to future\nelectricity prices, DRL agents can only react to the currently observed price\nand not learn to plan battery dispatch. Therefore, in this study, we combine\nDRL with time-series forecasting methods from deep learning to enhance the\nperformance on energy arbitrage. We conduct a case study using price data from\nAlberta, Canada that is characterized by irregular price spikes and highly\nnon-stationary. This data is challenging to forecast even when state-of-the-art\ndeep learning models consisting of convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and\nattention modules are deployed. Our results show that energy arbitrage with\nDRL-enabled battery control still significantly benefits from these imperfect\npredictions, but only if predictors for several horizons are combined. Grouping\nmultiple predictions for the next 24-hour window, accumulated rewards increased\nby 60% for deep Q-networks (DQN) compared to the experiments without forecasts.\nWe hypothesize that multiple predictors, despite their imperfections, convey\nuseful information regarding the future development of electricity prices\nthrough a \"majority vote\" principle, enabling the DRL agent to learn more\nprofitable control policies.",

    "abstract": "Pretrained foundation models have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning\nperformance, allowing zero-shot generalization to new tasks not encountered\nduring pretraining. In the case of reinforcement learning (RL), in-context RL\n(ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an\nautoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art ICRL\nalgorithms, like Algorithm Distillation, Decision Pretrained Transformer and\nDecision Importance Transformer, impose stringent requirements on the\npretraining dataset concerning the source policies, context information, and\naction labels. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or\nrequire varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all pretraining\nenvironments. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world\nscenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial\nvolume of real-world training environments can be intractable. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation\n(SAD), that allows to generate an effective pretraining dataset guided solely\nby random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding\naction labels by distilling outstanding state-action pairs from the entire\nstate and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and\nthen inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during\npretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables\neffective ICRL under random policies and random contexts. We also establish\nquantitative analysis of the trustworthiness as well as the performance\nguarantees of SAD. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple popular ICRL\nbenchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best\nbaseline by 236.3% in the offline evaluation and by 135.2% in the online\nevaluation.",

In this thesis, we study ways toward\nrobust OoD generalization for deep learning, i.e., its performance is not\nsusceptible to distribution shift in the test data.\n  We first propose a novel and effective approach to disentangle the spurious\ncorrelation between features that are not essential for recognition. It employs\ndecomposed feature representation by orthogonalizing the two gradients of\nlosses for category and context branches. Furthermore, we perform\ngradient-based augmentation on context-related features (e.g., styles,\nbackgrounds, or scenes of target objects) to improve the robustness of learned\nrepresentations. Results show that our approach generalizes well for different\ndistribution shifts.\n  We then study the problem of strengthening neural architecture search in OoD\nscenarios. We propose to optimize the architecture parameters that minimize the\nvalidation loss on synthetic OoD data, under the condition that corresponding\nnetwork parameters minimize the training loss. Moreover, to obtain a proper\nvalidation set, we learn a conditional generator by maximizing their losses\ncomputed by different neural architectures.

Writing proofs manually\nrequires both significant effort and expertise.

We introduce Cobblestone, a new proof-synthesis approach\nthat improves on the state of the art by taking advantage of partial progress\nin proof synthesis attempts. Unlike prior tools, Cobblestone can produce\nmultiple unsuccessful proofs using a large language model (LLM), identify the\nworking portions of those proofs, and combine them into a single, successful\nproof, taking advantage of internal partial progress. We evaluate Cobblestone\non two benchmarks of open-source Coq projects, controlling for training data\nleakage in LLM datasets. Fully automatically, Cobblestone can prove 48% of the\ntheorems, while Proverbot9001, the previous state-of-the-art, learning-based,\nproof-synthesis tool, can prove 17%. Cobblestone establishes a new state of the\nart for fully automated proof synthesis tools for Coq. We also evaluate\nCobblestone in a setting where it is given external partial proof progress from\noracles, serving as proxies for a human proof engineer or another tool. When\nthe theorem is broken down into a set of subgoals and Cobblestone is given a\nset of relevant lemmas already proven in the project, it can prove up to 58% of\nthe theorems. We qualitatively study the theorems Cobblestone is and is not\nable to prove to outline potential future research directions to further\nimprove proof synthesis, including developing interactive, semi-automated\ntools.

Intuitively, for a jailbreak prompt to be effective, its tokens must\nachieve sufficient `importance' (as measured by attention scores), which\ninevitably lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query.\nThus, by strategically evicting the KVs of the lowest-ranked tokens, RobustKV\ndiminishes the presence of the harmful query in the KV cache, thus preventing\nthe LLM from generating malicious responses. Extensive evaluation using\nbenchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters\nstate-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's general\nperformance on benign queries. Moreover, RobustKV creates an intriguing\nevasiveness dilemma for adversaries, forcing them to balance between evading\nRobustKV and bypassing the LLM's built-in safeguards. This trade-off\ncontributes to RobustKV's robustness against adaptive attacks. (warning: this\npaper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)",

Current approaches often decouple these\ntwo objectives, training separate preference models for helpfulness and safety,\nwhile framing safety as a constraint within a constrained Markov Decision\nProcess (CMDP) framework. This paper identifies a potential issue when using\nthe widely adopted expected safety constraints for LLM safety alignment, termed\n\"safety compensation\", where the constraints are satisfied on expectation, but\nindividual prompts may trade off safety, resulting in some responses being\noverly restrictive while others remain unsafe. To address this issue, we\npropose Rectified Policy Optimization (RePO), which replaces the expected\nsafety constraint with critical safety constraints imposed on every prompt. At\nthe core of RePO is a policy update mechanism driven by rectified policy\ngradients, which penalizes the strict safety violation of every prompt, thereby\nenhancing safety across nearly all prompts.

Counting, a\nfundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to\ngrow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have\nestablished the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert\nmodels (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings\ndo not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning\nmechanisms.

    "abstract": "This review paper explores recent advances in deep learning approaches for\nnon-invasive cognitive impairment detection. We examine various non-invasive\nindicators of cognitive decline, including speech and language, facial, and\nmotoric mobility. The paper provides an overview of relevant datasets,\nfeature-extracting techniques, and deep-learning architectures applied to this\ndomain. We have analyzed the performance of different methods across modalities\nand observed that speech and language-based methods generally achieved the\nhighest detection performance. Studies combining acoustic and linguistic\nfeatures tended to outperform those using a single modality. Facial analysis\nmethods showed promise for visual modalities but were less extensively studied.\nMost papers focused on binary classification (impaired vs. non-impaired), with\nfewer addressing multi-class or regression tasks. Transfer learning and\npre-trained language models emerged as popular and effective techniques,\nespecially for linguistic analysis. Despite significant progress, several\nchallenges remain, including data standardization and accessibility, model\nexplainability, longitudinal analysis limitations, and clinical adaptation.\nLastly, we propose future research directions, such as investigating\nlanguage-agnostic speech analysis methods, developing multi-modal diagnostic\nsystems, and addressing ethical considerations in AI-assisted healthcare. By\nsynthesizing current trends and identifying key obstacles, this review aims to\nguide further development of deep learning-based cognitive impairment detection\nsystems to improve early diagnosis and ultimately patient outcomes.",

It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio,\nmeaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o\ncan respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average\nof 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation.\nIt matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with\nsignificant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much\nfaster and 50\\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and\naudio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to\nbuilding AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White\nHouse, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness\nFramework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at\nGPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple\ncategories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image\ncapabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and\naligned.

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms behind emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems\nis critical for advancing fields such as swarm robotics and artificial\nintelligence. In this study, we investigate how neural networks evolve to\ncontrol agents' behavior in a dynamic environment, focusing on the relationship\nbetween the network's complexity and collective behavior patterns. By\nperforming quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that the\ndegree of network non-linearity correlates with the complexity of emergent\nbehaviors. Simpler behaviors, such as lane formation and laminar flow, are\ncharacterized by more linear network operations, while complex behaviors like\nswarming and flocking show highly non-linear neural processing. Moreover,\nspecific environmental parameters, such as moderate noise, broader field of\nview, and lower agent density, promote the evolution of non-linear networks\nthat drive richer, more intricate collective behaviors. These results highlight\nthe importance of tuning evolutionary conditions to induce desired behaviors in\nmulti-agent systems, offering new pathways for optimizing coordination in\nautonomous swarms. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how\nneural mechanisms influence collective dynamics, with implications for the\ndesign of intelligent, self-organizing systems.",

    "abstract": "Training agents that are robust to environmental changes remains a\nsignificant challenge in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised\nenvironment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by\ngenerating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities.\nWhile prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust\npolicy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment\ngeneration. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial\nenvironment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed\nmethod guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the\nagent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to\nfurther improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion\nmodels, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining\nthe diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn\na robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nsuccessfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming\nUED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "Foundation models applied to bio-molecular space hold promise to accelerate\ndrug discovery. Molecular representation is key to building such models.\nPrevious works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the\nmolecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that\nintegrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation\nmodels are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then\naggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on\na diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular\nsolubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform\nrobustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific\nviews. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (>100\ntargets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of\ntargets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive\nperformance in short video understanding. However, understanding long-form\nvideos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a\ncollection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long\nvideo understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long\nvideo sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and\na carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the\ngrounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on\nVideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by\nimplementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing\nTemporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of\nvisual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive\ngrounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k\nhigh-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning\ntask type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video\ndescriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit\ntemporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual\ncontent when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk\ncaused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite\nprovides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding\ncapability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the\nbenchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T\nexhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly\noutperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it\nperforms on par with the traditional supervised expert models.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the inclusion of microservices architecture in the\ndevelopment of scalable and reliable airline reservation systems. Most of the\ntraditional reservation systems are very rigid and centralized which makes them\nprone to bottlenecks and a single point of failure. As such, systems do not\nmeet the requirements of modern airlines which are dynamic. Microservices offer\nbetter resiliency and scalability because the services do not depend on one\nanother and can be deployed independently. The approach is grounded on the\nCircuit Breaker Pattern to maintain fault tolerance while consuming foreign\nresources such as flight APIs and payment systems. This avoided the failure\npropagation to the systems by 60% enabling the systems to function under\nexternal failures. Traffic rerouting also bolstered this with a guarantee of\nabove 99.95% uptime in systems where high availability was demanded. To address\nthis, load balancing was used, particularly the Round-Robin method which\nmanaged to enhance performance by 35% through the equal distribution of user\nrequests among the service instances. Health checks, as well as monitoring in\nreal-time, helped as well with failure management as they helped to contain\nfailures before the users of the system were affected. The results suggest that\nthe use of microservices led to a 40% increase in system scalability, a 50%\ndecrease in downtime and a support for 30% more concurrent users than the use\nof monolithic architectures. These findings affirm the capability of\nmicroservices in the development of robust and flexible airline ticket booking\nsystems that are responsive to change and recover from external system\nunavailability.",

The\nmapping module computes the probability of the object of interest through\nsemantic segmentation and a Bayes filter. Additionally, it stores probabilities\nfor common objects, which semantically guides the exploration based on common\nsense priors from a large language model.

Although our planner follows a zero-shot approach, it\nachieves state-of-the-art performance as measured by the Success weighted by\nPath Length (SPL) and Soft SPL in the Habitat ObjectNav Challenge 2023,\noutperforming other works by more than 20%.

    "abstract": "Shared control problems involve a robot learning to collaborate with a human.\nWhen learning a shared control policy, short communication between the agents\ncan often significantly reduce running times and improve the system's accuracy.\nWe extend the shared control problem to include the ability to directly query a\ncooperating agent. We consider two types of potential responses to a query,\nnamely oracles: one that can provide the learner with the best action they\nshould take, even when that action might be myopically wrong, and one with a\nbounded knowledge limited to its part of the system. Given this additional\ninformation channel, this work further presents three heuristics for choosing\nwhen to query: reinforcement learning-based, utility-based, and entropy-based.\nThese heuristics aim to reduce a system's overall learning cost. Empirical\nresults on two environments show the benefits of querying to learn a better\ncontrol policy and the tradeoffs between the proposed heuristics.",

We formally confirm an\nintuitive expectation: existing models suffer a lot as occlusion severity is\nincreased and exhibit different behaviours when occluders are static vs when\nthey are moving. We discover several intriguing phenomenon emerging in neural\nnets: 1) transformers can naturally outperform CNN models which might have even\nused occlusion as a form of data augmentation during training 2) incorporating\nsymbolic-components like capsules to such backbones allows them to bind to\noccluders never even seen during training and 3) Islands of agreement can\nemerge in realistic images/videos without instance-level supervision,\ndistillation or contrastive-based objectives2(eg. video-textual training). Such\nemergent properties allow us to derive simple yet effective training recipes\nwhich lead to robust occlusion models inductively satisfying the first two\nstages of the binding mechanism (grouping/segregation).

Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment\nbetween the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs)\nand the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs\nmay employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment\nhas been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and\nlinguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons\n(ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of\nindividual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored.\nIn this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial\nneurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational\nstructure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns\nfrom temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as\nfixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain\nactivity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This\nframework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of\nbrain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs\n(BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with\nsub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of\nwell-established FBNs.

However, the challenge of balancing DR\naccuracy and interpretability remains crucial, particularly for users dealing\nwith high-dimensional data. Traditional DR methods often face a trade-off\nbetween precision and transparency, where optimizing for performance can lead\nto reduced interpretability, and vice versa. This limitation is especially\nprominent in real-world applications such as image, tabular, and text data\nanalysis, where both accuracy and interpretability are critical.

The proposed approach combines\nhyperbolic embeddings, which effectively capture complex hierarchical\nstructures, with Mixture of Experts (MOE) models, which dynamically allocate\ntasks based on input features. DMT-HI enhances DR accuracy by leveraging\nhyperbolic embeddings to represent the hierarchical nature of data, while also\nimproving interpretability by explicitly linking input data, embedding\noutcomes, and key features through the MOE structure. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that DMT-HI consistently achieves superior performance in both DR\naccuracy and model interpretability, making it a robust solution for complex\ndata analysis.

We contend that the key to\naddressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level\nsemantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response\nto video stimuli.

However, most existing research has\nfocused on single-agent settings, with limited exploration of the multi-agent\nextension, i.e., Offline-to-Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (O2O\nMARL). In O2O MARL, two critical challenges become more prominent as the number\nof agents increases: (i) the risk of unlearning pre-trained Q-values due to\ndistributional shifts during the transition from offline-to-online phases, and\n(ii) the difficulty of efficient exploration in the large joint state-action\nspace. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel O2O MARL framework called\nOffline Value Function Memory with Sequential Exploration (OVMSE). First, we\nintroduce the Offline Value Function Memory (OVM) mechanism to compute target\nQ-values, preserving knowledge gained during offline training, ensuring\nsmoother transitions, and enabling efficient fine-tuning. Second, we propose a\ndecentralized Sequential Exploration (SE) strategy tailored for O2O MARL, which\neffectively utilizes the pre-trained offline policy for exploration, thereby\nsignificantly reducing the joint state-action space to be explored.

This vulnerability is exacerbated in the era of large models, where\nextensive (pre-)training on web-crawled datasets is susceptible to compromise.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel two-step defense framework named Expose\nBefore You Defend (EBYD). EBYD unifies existing backdoor defense methods into a\ncomprehensive defense system with enhanced performance. Specifically, EBYD\nfirst exposes the backdoor functionality in the backdoored model through a\nmodel preprocessing step called backdoor exposure, and then applies detection\nand removal methods to the exposed model to identify and eliminate the backdoor\nfeatures. In the first step of backdoor exposure, we propose a novel technique\ncalled Clean Unlearning (CUL), which proactively unlearns clean features from\nthe backdoored model to reveal the hidden backdoor features. We also explore\nvarious model editing/modification techniques for backdoor exposure, including\nfine-tuning, model sparsification, and weight perturbation. Using EBYD, we\nconduct extensive experiments on 10 image attacks and 6 text attacks across 2\nvision datasets (CIFAR-10 and an ImageNet subset) and 4 language datasets\n(SST-2, IMDB, Twitter, and AG's News).

Deep learning\ndiscriminative models, typically fed with multi-band galaxy images, can produce\noutputs that mimic probability densities and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.\nHowever, such models may be affected by miscalibration that would result in\ndiscrepancies between the model outputs and the actual distributions of true\nredshifts. Our work develops a novel method called the Contrastive Learning and\nAdaptive KNN for Photometric Redshift (CLAP) that resolves this issue. It\nleverages supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and k-nearest neighbours (KNN)\nto construct and calibrate raw probability density estimates, and implements a\nrefitting procedure to resume end-to-end discriminative models ready to produce\nfinal estimates for large-scale imaging data. The harmonic mean is adopted to\ncombine an ensemble of estimates from multiple realisations for improving\naccuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that CLAP takes advantage of both deep\nlearning and KNN, outperforming benchmark methods on the calibration of\nprobability density estimates and retaining high accuracy and computational\nefficiency. With reference to CLAP, we point out that miscalibration is\nparticularly sensitive to the method-induced excessive correlations among data\ninstances in addition to the unaccounted-for epistemic uncertainties. Reducing\nthe uncertainties may not guarantee the removal of miscalibration due to the\npresence of such excessive correlations, yet this is a problem for conventional\ndeep learning methods rather than CLAP. These discussions underscore the\nrobustness of CLAP for obtaining photometric redshift probability densities\nrequired by astrophysical and cosmological applications.

Prompt engineering, the process of designing and formulating\ninstructions for LLMs to perform specific tasks, has emerged as a key approach\nto mitigating hallucinations. This paper provides a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of different prompting strategies and frameworks aimed at reducing\nhallucinations in LLMs. Various prompting techniques are applied to a broad set\nof benchmark datasets to assess the accuracy and hallucination rate of each\nmethod. Additionally, the paper investigates the influence of tool-calling\nagents (LLMs augmented with external tools to enhance their capabilities beyond\nlanguage generation) on hallucination rates in the same benchmarks. The\nfindings demonstrate that the optimal prompting technique depends on the type\nof problem, and that simpler techniques often outperform more complex methods\nin reducing hallucinations. Furthermore, it is shown that LLM agents can\nexhibit significantly higher hallucination rates due to the added complexity of\nexternal tool usage.",

    "abstract": "The Transformer model has demonstrated success across a wide range of\ndomains, including in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) where the\nMulti-Agent Transformer (MAT) has emerged as a leading algorithm in the field.\nHowever, a significant drawback of Transformer models is their quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to input size, making them computationally\nexpensive when scaling to larger inputs. This limitation restricts MAT's\nscalability in environments with many agents. Recently, State-Space Models\n(SSMs) have gained attention due to their computational efficiency, but their\napplication in MARL remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the use of\nMamba, a recent SSM, in MARL and assess whether it can match the performance of\nMAT while providing significant improvements in efficiency. We introduce a\nmodified version of MAT that incorporates standard and bi-directional Mamba\nblocks, as well as a novel \"cross-attention\" Mamba block. Extensive testing\nshows that our Multi-Agent Mamba (MAM) matches the performance of MAT across\nmultiple standard multi-agent environments, while offering superior scalability\nto larger agent scenarios. This is significant for the MARL community, because\nit indicates that SSMs could replace Transformers without compromising\nperformance, whilst also supporting more effective scaling to higher numbers of\nagents.

Recently, many synchronous pipeline\nparallelism approaches have been proposed to improve training throughput.\nHowever, these approaches still suffer from two major issues, i.e., pipeline\nbubbles caused by periodic flushing and extra communication due to the\nincreasing number of pipeline stages. To this end, we propose BitPipe, a\nbidirectional interleaved pipeline parallelism for accelerating large models\ntraining. Specifically, a hybrid scheme of fusing interleaved pipelines with\nbidirectional pipelines is proposed to reduce the computational time of each\nsingle micro-batch and multiply the number of devices executing simultaneously.\nA V-shaped schedule with eager gradient synchronization is introduced to reduce\nand overlap the communication between devices. Experiments conducted on up to\n32 GPUs show that BitPipe improves the training throughput of GPT-style and\nBERT-style models by 1.05x-1.28x compared to the state-of-the-art synchronous\napproaches.

The process of sampling from\nthese models is notoriously demanding on computational resources, as it\nnecessitates the use of multi-step numerical ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs). Against this backdrop, this paper presents a novel solution with\ntheoretical guarantees in the form of Flow Generator Matching (FGM), an\ninnovative approach designed to accelerate the sampling of flow-matching models\ninto a one-step generation, while maintaining the original performance. On the\nCIFAR10 unconditional generation benchmark, our one-step FGM model achieves a\nnew record Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 3.08 among few-step\nflow-matching-based models, outperforming original 50-step flow-matching\nmodels. Furthermore, we use the FGM to distill the Stable Diffusion 3, a\nleading text-to-image flow-matching model based on the MM-DiT architecture. The\nresulting MM-DiT-FGM one-step text-to-image model demonstrates outstanding\nindustry-level performance. When evaluated on the GenEval benchmark, MM-DiT-FGM\nhas delivered remarkable generating qualities, rivaling other multi-step models\nin light of the efficiency of a single generation step.",

Instead of representing a user's interests through a latent\nembedding, TEARS encodes them in natural text, providing transparency and\nallowing users to edit them. To do so, TEARS uses a modern LLM to generate user\nsummaries based on user preferences. We find the summaries capture user\npreferences uniquely. Using these summaries, we take a hybrid approach where we\nuse an optimal transport procedure to align the summaries' representation with\nthe learned representation of a standard VAE for collaborative filtering.

This network is trained using the whole\npatient-specific image sequence, enabling the prediction of deformation fields\nat various target time points. The efficacy of the ST-NeRP model is\ndemonstrated through its application to diverse sequential image series,\nincluding 4D CT and longitudinal CT datasets within thoracic and abdominal\nimaging.

Two\nsubsequent studies -- using empirical and simulated data -- illustrate the\nprocess of creating Agents and validate the results by showing strong\ncorrespondence between human and Agent answers to personality tests. The final\nstudy further corroborates this correspondence by using Agents to replicate\nknown human correlations between personality traits and decision-making\nbehaviors in scenarios involving risk-taking and ethical dilemmas, thereby\nvalidating the effectiveness of the psychometric approach to design Agents and\nits applicability to social and behavioral research.",

    "abstract": "Robots hold great promise for performing repetitive or hazardous tasks, but\nachieving human-like dexterity, especially in contact-rich and dynamic\nenvironments, remains challenging. Rigid robots, which rely on position or\nvelocity control, often struggle with maintaining stable contact and applying\nconsistent force in force-intensive tasks. Learning from Demonstration has\nemerged as a solution, but tasks requiring intricate maneuvers, such as powder\ngrinding, present unique difficulties. This paper introduces Diffusion Policies\nFor Compliant Manipulation (DIPCOM), a novel diffusion-based framework designed\nfor compliant control tasks. By leveraging generative diffusion models, we\ndevelop a policy that predicts Cartesian end-effector poses and adjusts arm\nstiffness to maintain the necessary force. Our approach enhances force control\nthrough multimodal distribution modeling, improves the integration of diffusion\npolicies in compliance control, and extends our previous work by demonstrating\nits effectiveness in real-world tasks. We present a detailed comparison between\nour framework and existing methods, highlighting the advantages and best\npractices for deploying diffusion-based compliance control.",

We developed a\nsynthetic tutoring dialog dataset, evaluated by human teachers, and fine-tuned\na smaller LLM using this dataset. Furthermore, we conducted an interactive\nexperiment comparing the performance of the fine-tuned model with a larger\nmodel in real-world tutoring scenarios.

    "abstract": "High-level synthesis (HLS) is a widely used tool in designing Field\nProgrammable Gate Array (FPGA). HLS enables FPGA design with software\nprogramming languages by compiling the source code into an FPGA circuit. The\nsource code includes a program (called \"kernel\") and several pragmas that\ninstruct hardware synthesis, such as parallelization, pipeline, etc. While it\nis relatively easy for software developers to design the program, it heavily\nrelies on hardware knowledge to design the pragmas, posing a big challenge for\nsoftware developers. Recently, different machine learning algorithms, such as\nGNNs, have been proposed to automate the pragma design via performance\nprediction. However, when applying the trained model on new kernels, the\nsignificant domain shift often leads to unsatisfactory performance. We propose\na more domain-generalizable model structure: a two-level hierarchical Mixture\nof Experts (MoE), that can be flexibly adapted to any GNN model. Different\nexpert networks can learn to deal with different regions in the representation\nspace, and they can utilize similar patterns between the old kernels and new\nkernels. In the low-level MoE, we apply MoE on three natural granularities of a\nprogram: node, basic block, and graph. The high-level MoE learns to aggregate\nthe three granularities for the final decision. To train the hierarchical MoE\nstably, we further propose a two-stage training method to avoid expert\npolarization. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nhierarchical MoE. We publicized our codes at\nhttps://github.com/weikai-li/HierarchicalMoE.",

We create\nTask Adaptation using Abstract Concepts (TAACo) framework.

TAACo can generalize to an open set of household\ntasks from small amount of user feedback and explain its inferences through\nintuitive concepts.

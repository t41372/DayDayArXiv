    "abstract": "Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT (Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\\% passkey retrieval accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance on S-NIAH 1\\&2\\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark (QA2\\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\\% pre-training tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive long-sequence training data and computational resources.

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements, zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection, multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against the rising tide of deepfake attacks.",

To enable more precise failure analysis, we introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($ρ$) regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic, factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.",

    "abstract": "Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) requires robots to adapt to individual contact preferences, such as where and how much force is applied. Identifying preferences is difficult for a single contact; with whole-arm interaction involving multiple simultaneous contacts between the robot and human, the challenge is greater because different body parts can impose incompatible force requirements. In caregiving tasks, where contact is frequent and varied, such conflicts are unavoidable. With multiple preferences across multiple contacts, no single solution can satisfy all objectives--trade-offs are inherent, making prioritization essential. We present PrioriTouch, a framework for ranking and executing control objectives across multiple contacts. PrioriTouch can prioritize from a general collection of controllers, making it applicable not only to caregiving scenarios such as bed bathing and dressing but also to broader multi-contact settings. Our method combines a novel learning-to-rank approach with hierarchical operational space control, leveraging simulation-in-the-loop rollouts for data-efficient and safe exploration. We conduct a user study on physical assistance preferences, derive personalized comfort thresholds, and incorporate them into PrioriTouch. We evaluate PrioriTouch through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to adapt to user contact preferences, maintain task performance, and enhance safety and comfort.

    "abstract": "Shared decision-making (SDM) is necessary to achieve patient-centred care. Currently no methodology exists to automatically measure SDM at scale. This study aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language modelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157 video-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre trial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations were transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs and negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and fine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each top-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A random-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial arm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in Decision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female, mean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients (1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1 of 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1 with 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012) scores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12. The Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated with the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037). BERT model sizes did not have an impact the association between CA scores and SDM. This study introduces an automated, scalable methodology to measure SDM in patient-doctor conversations through explainable CA scores, with potential to evaluate SDM strategies at scale.",

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14 weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations, enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy standards in the AI industry.",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to address the need for skilled clinicians in heart sound interpretation, recent research efforts on automating cardiac auscultation have explored deep learning approaches. The majority of these approaches have been based on supervised learning that is always challenged in occasions where training data is limited. More recently, there has been a growing interest in potentials of pre-trained self-supervised audio foundation models for biomedical end tasks. Despite exhibiting promising results, these foundational models are typically computationally intensive. Within the context of automatic cardiac auscultation, this study explores a lightweight alternative to these general-purpose audio foundation models by introducing the Scattering Transformer, a novel, training-free transformer architecture for heart murmur detection. The proposed method leverages standard wavelet scattering networks by introducing contextual dependencies in a transformer-like architecture without any backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on the public CirCor DigiScope dataset, directly comparing it against leading general-purpose foundational models. The Scattering Transformer achieves a Weighted Accuracy(WAR) of 0.786 and an Unweighted Average Recall(UAR) of 0.697, demonstrating performance highly competitive with contemporary state of the art methods. This study establishes the Scattering Transformer as a viable and promising alternative in resource-constrained setups.",

Unlike traditional A2A models that primarily secure point-to-point interactions, our approach enables both agents and external verifiers to cryptographically validate multi-hop provenance, thereby ensuring the integrity of the entire call chain.\n  A federated proof server acts as an auditor across one or more Merkle logs, aggregating inclusion proofs and consistency checks into compact, signed attestations that external parties can verify without access to the full execution trace. In parallel, we augment the A2A agent card to incorporate explicit identity verification primitives, enabling both peer agents and human approvers to authenticate the legitimacy of NHI representations in a standardized manner. Together, these contributions establish a cohesive model that integrates identity attestation, lineage verification, and independent proof auditing, thereby advancing the security posture of inter-agent ecosystems and providing a foundation for robust governance of NHIs in regulated environments such as FedRAMP.",

Increasing clinical workload often limits attendings' ability to provide guidance. This study evaluates a HIPAA-compliant GPT-4o system that delivers automated feedback on breast imaging reports drafted by residents in real clinical settings.\n  Methods: We analyzed 5,000 resident-attending report pairs from routine practice at a multi-site U.S. health system. GPT-4o was prompted with clinical instructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study using 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four residents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error types were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement between GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was measured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.\n  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition of key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and (3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement with attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types. Inter-reader reliability showed moderate variability (α = 0.767, 0.595, 0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect agreement (Δ = -0.004 to 0.002).

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled intersections account for a significant fraction of roadway crashes due to ambiguous right-of-way rules, occlusions, and unpredictable driver behavior. While autonomous vehicle research has explored uncertainty-aware decision making, few systems exist to retrofit human-operated vehicles with assistive navigation support. We present a driver-assist framework for right-of-way reasoning at uncontrolled intersections, formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Using a custom simulation testbed with stochastic traffic agents, pedestrians, occlusions, and adversarial scenarios, we evaluate four decision-making approaches: a deterministic finite state machine (FSM), and three probabilistic planners: QMDP, POMCP, and DESPOT. Results show that probabilistic planners outperform the rule-based baseline, achieving up to 97.5 percent collision-free navigation under partial observability, with POMCP prioritizing safety and DESPOT balancing efficiency and runtime feasibility. Our findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware planning for driver assistance and motivate future integration of sensor fusion and environment perception modules for real-time deployment in realistic traffic environments.",

    "abstract": "Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking. Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence risks are multidimensional in nature, as the same risk scenarios may have legal, operational, and financial risk dimensions. With the emergence of new AI regulations, the state of the art of artificial intelligence risk management seems to be highly immature due to upcoming AI regulations. Despite the appearance of several methodologies and generic criteria, it is rare to find guidelines with real implementation value, considering that the most important issue is customizing artificial intelligence risk metrics and risk models for specific AI risk scenarios. Furthermore, the financial departments, legal departments and Government Risk Compliance teams seem to remain unaware of many technical aspects of AI systems, in which data scientists and AI engineers emerge as the most appropriate implementers. It is crucial to decompose the problem of artificial intelligence risk in several dimensions: data protection, fairness, accuracy, robustness, and information security. Consequently, the main task is developing adequate metrics and risk models that manage to reduce uncertainty for decision-making in order to take informed decisions concerning the risk management of AI systems.\n  The purpose of this paper is to orientate AI stakeholders about the depths of AI risk management. Although it is not extremely technical, it requires a basic knowledge of risk management, quantifying uncertainty, the FAIR model, machine learning, large language models and AI context engineering. The examples presented pretend to be very basic and understandable, providing simple ideas that can be developed regarding specific AI customized environments. There are many issues to solve in AI risk management, and this paper will present a holistic overview of the inter-dependencies of AI risks, and how to model them together, within risk scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.\n  Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.\n  The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.\n  A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.\n  To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations.\n  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.",

    "abstract": "Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the Gödel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the Gödel Test.",

A frozen MaxViT yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a lightweight bridge links the modalities.

This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR 27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14, BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy, communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d. datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond the benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing is an established technology allowing users to share resources on a large scale, never before seen in IT history. A cloud system connects multiple individual servers in order to process related tasks in several environments at the same time. Clouds are typically more cost-effective than single computers of comparable computing performance. The sheer physical size of the system itself means that thousands of machines may be involved. The focus of this research was to design a strategy to dynamically allocate tasks without overloading Cloud nodes which would result in system stability being maintained at minimum cost. This research has added the following new contributions to the state of knowledge: (i) a novel taxonomy and categorisation of three classes of schedulers, namely OS-level, Cluster and Big Data, which highlight their unique evolution and underline their different objectives; (ii) an abstract model of cloud resources utilisation is specified, including multiple types of resources and consideration of task migration costs; (iii) a virtual machine live migration was experimented with in order to create a formula which estimates the network traffic generated by this process; (iv) a high-fidelity Cloud workload simulator, based on a month-long workload traces from Google's computing cells, was created; (v) two possible approaches to resource management were proposed and examined in the practical part of the manuscript: the centralised metaheuristic load balancer and the decentralised agent-based system.

    "abstract": "Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet",

Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework, summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness, Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR: 0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3). These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths, where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians' diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first systematic assessment of \"reward model style\" reasoning over clinical KGs, offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.",

L2C trains a neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution quality over state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Detecting hateful content is a challenging and important problem. Automated tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work, we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content, specifically leveraging in-context definition. We also study how LLMs understand and explain their decisions given a moderation policy as a guideline. First, we explore various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT, and find that injecting domain-specific thoughts increases performance and utility. Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, improving performance and utility by reducing refusals across all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model size, or reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5. Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation policies often fail to generalize because they must simultaneously learn where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute them. We argue that high-level reasoning about where and what can be offloaded to vision-language models (VLMs), leaving policies to specialize in how to act. We present PEEK (Policy-agnostic Extraction of Essential Keypoints), which fine-tunes VLMs to predict a unified point-based intermediate representation: 1. end-effector paths specifying what actions to take, and 2. task-relevant masks indicating where to focus. These annotations are directly overlaid onto robot observations, making the representation policy-agnostic and transferable across architectures. To enable scalable training, we introduce an automatic annotation pipeline, generating labeled data across 20+ robot datasets spanning 9 embodiments. In real-world evaluations, PEEK consistently boosts zero-shot generalization, including a 41.4x real-world improvement for a 3D policy trained only in simulation, and 2-3.5x gains for both large VLAs and small manipulation policies. By letting VLMs absorb semantic and visual complexity, PEEK equips manipulation policies with the minimal cues they need--where, what, and how. Website at https://peek-robot.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.",

We demonstrate the discriminative power of activation norms and introduce SEQR, an unsupervised LoRA routing algorithm designed to maximize efficiency while providing strict routing guarantees.

    "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems.\n  In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\\%$ increase in advertising revenue.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\\mathbf{7.9\\times}$.",

Experimental results show that our method reduces tool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines across diverse model series and approaches.

We evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and factual accuracy.\n  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of ableism embedded in model behavior.\n  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for disabled users.

We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.",

To address this issue, we propose TMD-TTS, a unified Tibetan multi-dialect text-to-speech (TTS) framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from explicit dialect labels. Our method features a dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that TMD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in dialectal expressiveness.

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.",

We provide evidence towards answering this in the affirmative, using AlphaEvolve (an LLM code mutation agent) to obtain new results in three settings:\n  a) We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ vertices, and our upper bounds are obtained via analytical arguments.\n  b) We obtain new inapproximability results for MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate them within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP (rather than a reduction from ``standard'' Håstad-style PCPs).\n  c) Inapproximability for the metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum cost tour within a factor of $111/110$ using AlphaEvolve to discover a new gadget, thus improving the SOTA of $117/116$. Along the way, we provide new modular soundness and completeness arguments that can be of independent interest.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (sometimes requiring time exponential in the size of the construction). We used AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\\times$ for our gadgets). Our results suggest that gadget based proofs would benefit from a pass through AI-based tools to obtain stronger results.",

    "abstract": "Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an NP-hard optimization problem with multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the number of facilities, objectives, and constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make this expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework. In this framework, a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) is constructed from the literature. The method then employs a multifaceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this KG using three distinct approaches: precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and cluster-based high-level search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations based on data-driven reasoning. This KG-RAG framework is tested on a use case consisting of six problems comprising of complex multi-objective and multi-constraint FLP case. The results are compared with the Gemini 1.5 Flash chatbot. The results show that KG-RAG achieves an average reasoning score of 4.7 out of 5 compared to 3.3 for the baseline chatbot.",

A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions.",

The analysis highlights recurring patterns in individual, contextual, and technical factors influencing perception, while also tracing variations in institutional trust, perceived fairness, and ethical concerns. We show that the public perception in AI is shaped not only by technical design or performance but also by sector-specific considerations as well as imaginaries, cultural narratives, and historical legacies.

However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, but showed improvements when provided examples through few shot prompting. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.",

Its scores have been repurposed for various downstream applications--such as timestamp estimation and audio-text alignment--under the assumption that they reflect the dependencies between input speech representation and the generated text. While the explanatory nature of attention mechanisms has been widely debated in the broader NLP literature, this assumption remains largely unexplored within the speech domain. To address this gap, we assess the explanatory power of cross-attention in S2T models by comparing its scores to input saliency maps derived from feature attribution. Our analysis spans monolingual and multilingual, single-task and multi-task models at multiple scales, and shows that attention scores moderately to strongly align with saliency-based explanations, particularly when aggregated across heads and layers. However, it also shows that cross-attention captures only about 50% of the input relevance and, in the best case, only partially reflects how the decoder attends to the encoder's representations--accounting for just 52-75% of the saliency. These findings uncover fundamental limitations in interpreting cross-attention as an explanatory proxy, suggesting that it offers an informative yet incomplete view of the factors driving predictions in S2T models.",

To support systematic investigations of these questions, we introduce an open and configurable research platform for HCI researchers. The platform's modular design allows seamless adaptation of classic CSCW experiments and manipulation of theory-grounded interaction controls. We demonstrate the platform's effectiveness and usability through two case studies: (1) re-implementing the classic human-human-collaboration task Shape Factory as a between-subject human-agent-collaboration experiment with 16 participants, and (2) a participatory cognitive walkthrough with five HCI researchers to refine workflows and interfaces for experiment setup and analysis.",

We leverage an extended Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework and analyze stochastic gradient noise (SGN) to characterize the dynamics of SAM variants, including n-SAM and m-SAM. Our analysis reveals that stochastic perturbations induce an implicit variance-based sharpness regularization whose strength increases as m decreases.

    "abstract": "The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation, we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and photonic chip design.

    "abstract": "Recent advances have shown that scaling test-time computation enables large language models (LLMs) to solve increasingly complex problems across diverse domains. One effective paradigm for test-time scaling (TTS) involves LLM generators producing multiple solution candidates, with LLM verifiers assessing the correctness of these candidates without reference answers. In this paper, we study generative verifiers, which perform verification by generating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning followed by a binary verdict. We systematically analyze verification dynamics across three dimensions - problem difficulty, generator capability, and verifier generation capability - with empirical studies on 12 benchmarks across mathematical reasoning, knowledge, and natural language reasoning tasks using 14 open-source models (2B to 72B parameter range) and GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal three key findings about verification effectiveness: (1) Easy problems allow verifiers to more reliably certify correct responses; (2) Weak generators produce errors that are easier to detect than strong generators; (3) Verification ability is generally correlated with the verifier's own problem-solving capability, but this relationship varies with problem difficulty. These findings reveal opportunities to optimize basic verification strategies in TTS applications. First, given the same verifier, some weak generators can nearly match stronger ones in post-verification TTS performance (e.g., the Gemma2-9B to Gemma2-27B performance gap shrinks by 75.5%). Second, we identify cases where strong verifiers offer limited advantage over weak ones, as both fail to provide meaningful verification gains, suggesting that verifier scaling alone cannot overcome fundamental verification challenges.",

    "abstract": "Almost 50% depression patients face the risk of going into relapse. The risk increases to 80% after the second episode of depression. Although, depression detection from social media has attained considerable attention, depression relapse detection has remained largely unexplored due to the lack of curated datasets and the difficulty of distinguishing relapse and non-relapse users. In this work, we present ReDepress, the first clinically validated social media dataset focused on relapse, comprising 204 Reddit users annotated by mental health professionals. Unlike prior approaches, our framework draws on cognitive theories of depression, incorporating constructs such as attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias and rumination into both annotation and modeling. Through statistical analyses and machine learning experiments, we demonstrate that cognitive markers significantly differentiate relapse and non-relapse groups, and that models enriched with these features achieve competitive performance, with transformer-based temporal models attaining an F1 of 0.86. Our findings validate psychological theories in real-world textual data and underscore the potential of cognitive-informed computational methods for early relapse detection, paving the way for scalable, low-cost interventions in mental healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The \"black box\" nature of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) presents critical limitations in reliability and transparency, fueling the debate around the \"illusion of thinking\" and the challenge of state hallucinations in agentic systems. In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel operational methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured Socratic dialogue governed by an explicit, evolving symbolic rulebook (the Consciousness Transfer Package - CTP) and a suite of integrity protocols, including a state-locking Checksum that eradicates internal state corruption. Through an exhaustive case study in the complex strategic game \"Caps i Caps,\" we demonstrate that this \"Clear Box\" framework transforms an opaque LRM into a disciplined strategist. The agent not only exhibits the emergence of complex tactics, such as long-term planning, but also achieves ante-hoc transparency by justifying its intentions before acting. Crucially, it demonstrates Second-Order Agency by identifying and correcting flaws in its own supervisor-approved plans, leading to empirically-proven, 100% reliable state tracking and achieving \"zero hallucinations by design.\" The STAR-XAI Protocol thus offers a practical pathway toward building AI agents that are not just high-performing but intrinsically auditable, trustworthy, and reliable.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the challenges of complementary-label learning (CLL), a specialized form of weakly-supervised learning (WSL) where models are trained with labels indicating classes to which instances do not belong, rather than standard ordinary labels. This alternative supervision is appealing because collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less labor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the development of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this domain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the widely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly applied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the complementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance of CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup (ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate the noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label sharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements across synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide spectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings justifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms, achieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, respectively.",

To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.",

    "abstract": "The human mind is capable of extraordinary achievements, yet it often appears to work against itself. It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to suit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common normative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not inherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant pragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these costs on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so, we suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of the motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical insights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from desired belief updating processes.",

We reveal that stakeholders' fairness decisions are more complex than typical AI expert practices: they considered features far beyond legally protected features, tailored metrics for specific contexts, set diverse yet stricter fairness thresholds, and even preferred designing customized fairness. Our results extend the understanding of how stakeholders can meaningfully contribute to AI fairness governance and mitigation, underscoring the importance of incorporating stakeholders' nuanced fairness judgments.",

Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, \"overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road\" consists of two specifications: \"overtake the pedestrian\" and \"walk on the right side of the road.\" To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.

Therefore, we introduce the Magic Evaluation Framework (MEF), a systematic and practical approach for evaluating T2I models. First, we propose a structured taxonomy encompassing user scenarios, elements, element compositions, and text expression forms to construct the Magic-Bench-377, which supports label-level assessment and ensures a balanced coverage of both user scenarios and capabilities. On this basis, we combine ELO and dimension-specific MOS to generate model rankings and fine-grained assessments respectively. This joint evaluation method further enables us to quantitatively analyze the contribution of each dimension to user satisfaction using multivariate logistic regression. By applying MEF to current T2I models, we obtain a leaderboard and key characteristics of the leading models. We release our evaluation framework and make Magic-Bench-377 fully open-source to advance research in the evaluation of visual generative models.",

However, existing research has overlooked a critical issue: selection bias of reasoning strategies during scaling. Specifically, when generating reasoning processes, LLMs tend to follow certain strategies (e.g., algebraic solutions for math problems) while neglecting other valid alternatives (e.g., geometric solutions), resulting in insufficient exploration of the solution space. To further understand the impact of this bias, we present a theoretical analysis that reveals when it undermines the effectiveness of test-time scaling. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we introduce TTS-Uniform, a framework designed to mitigate the selection bias of reasoning strategies. It (i) identifies potential strategies, (ii) uniformly allocates the sampling budget across them, and (iii) filters out unstable strategies prior to aggregation. Experimental results show that TTS-Uniform significantly enhances scaling effectiveness across multiple mainstream LLMs and benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress. Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events, thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Early-exit neural networks reduce inference cost by enabling confident predictions at intermediate layers. However, joint training often leads to gradient interference, with deeper classifiers dominating optimization. We propose Confidence-Gated Training (CGT), a paradigm that conditionally propagates gradients from deeper exits only when preceding exits fail. This encourages shallow classifiers to act as primary decision points while reserving deeper layers for harder inputs. By aligning training with the inference-time policy, CGT mitigates overthinking, improves early-exit accuracy, and preserves efficiency. Experiments on the Indian Pines and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks show that CGT lowers average inference cost while improving overall accuracy, offering a practical solution for deploying deep models in resource-constrained environments.",

In this article, we introduce targeted persuasion score (TPS), designed to quantify how persuasive a given context is to an LM where persuasion is operationalized as the ability of the context to alter the LM's answer to the question. In contrast to evaluating persuasiveness only by inspecting the greedily decoded answer under the model, TPS provides a more fine-grained view of model behavior. Based on the Wasserstein distance, TPS measures how much a context shifts a model's original answer distribution toward a target distribution. Empirically, through a series of experiments, we show that TPS captures a more nuanced notion of persuasiveness than previously proposed metrics.",

    "abstract": "Post-training fundamentally alters the behavior of large language models (LLMs), yet its impact on the internal parameter space remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two consistent and unexpected structural changes:(1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers, which theoretically modulates attention scores; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Disrupting this orthogonal consistency leads to catastrophic performance degradation. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective framework that interprets post-training as a reparameterization of fixed subspaces in the pretrained parameter space. Further experiments reveal that singular value scaling behaves as a secondary effect, analogous to a temperature adjustment, whereas the core functional transformation lies in the coordinated rotation of singular vectors. These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper investigation into model parameter changes.",

    "abstract": "In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.",

    "abstract": "Generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) texts in important works has become a common practice that can be used to misuse and abuse AI at various levels. Traditional AI detectors often rely on document-level classification, which struggles to identify AI content in hybrid or slightly edited texts designed to avoid detection, leading to concerns about the model's efficiency, which makes it hard to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated texts. A sentence-level sequence labeling model proposed to detect transitions between human- and AI-generated text, leveraging nuanced linguistic signals overlooked by document-level classifiers. By this method, detecting and segmenting AI and human-written text within a single document at the token-level granularity is achieved. Our model combines the state-of-the-art pre-trained Transformer models, incorporating Neural Networks (NN) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This approach extends the power of transformers to extract semantic and syntactic patterns, and the neural network component to capture enhanced sequence-level representations, thereby improving the boundary predictions by the CRF layer, which enhances sequence recognition and further identification of the partition between Human- and AI-generated texts. The evaluation is performed on two publicly available benchmark datasets containing collaborative human and AI-generated texts. Our experimental comparisons are with zero-shot detectors and the existing state-of-the-art models, along with rigorous ablation studies to justify that this approach, in particular, can accurately detect the spans of AI texts in a completely collaborative text.

To overcome this, we propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics, thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust, domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets demonstrate that TS-P$^2$CL consistently outperforms fourteen methods in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.",

(3) We develop a style-enhanced Direct Preference Optimization (SeDPO) method to optimize each style cluster's parameters for improved generation quality.

We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.",

    "abstract": "The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. The approach of McTavish et al. consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the QM method may incorrectly decide predictive equivalence, if two key constraints are not respected, and one may be difficult to formally guarantee. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.",

    "abstract": "We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time, maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner are publicly released under the Apache 2.0 license.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with information forgetting and inefficiency in long-horizon, multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we propose a training-free prompt engineering method, the State-Update Multi-turn Dialogue Strategy. It utilizes \"State Reconstruction\" and \"History Remind\" mechanisms to effectively manage dialogue history. Our strategy shows strong performance across multiple multi-hop QA datasets. For instance, on the HotpotQA dataset, it improves the core information filtering score by 32.6%, leading to a 14.1% increase in the downstream QA score, while also reducing inference time by 73.1% and token consumption by 59.4%. Ablation studies confirm the pivotal roles of both components. Our work offers an effective solution for optimizing LLMs in long-range interactions, providing new insights for developing more robust Agents.",

We present a novel approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise, third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing, GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse subject domains (68\\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations, provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore, MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs. categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data. GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance generative models for structured data.",

Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process (manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks, ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for computer control.",

This is especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification (CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP improvements of 10.0\\% and 5.2\\% on the long-tailed multi-label image classification task, and 6.8\\% and 2.9\\% on the multi-label few-shot image classification task.",

Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that foils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of adversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard adversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more resilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering (PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text into a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then quantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein distance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the classifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our PIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and sentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional adversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against semantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its True Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In stark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the discrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation. It maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively neutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance demonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than merely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine robustness in the adversarial arms race.",

In this work we introduce DA-Mamba, a dialogue-aware multimodal architecture that replaces attention-heavy dialogue encoders with Mamba-based selective state-space processing to achieve linear time and memory complexity while retaining expressive cross-modal reasoning. We design a Mamba dialogue-aware selective state-space model composed of three core modules: a Dialogue-Aware Encoder, and two Mamba-based fusion mechanisms: Modality-Group Fusion and Partner-Group Fusion, these modules achieve expressive dialogue understanding. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks (NoXi, NoXi-Add, and MPIIGI) show that DA-Mamba surpasses prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), while reducing training time and peak memory; these gains enable processing much longer sequences and facilitate real-time deployment in resource-constrained, multi-party conversational settings.

Approach (i) benefits from a vast catalog of constraints. Each soft constraint propagator communicates with other soft constraints only through the variable domains, resulting in weak lower bounds. Conversely, the approach (ii) provides a global view with strong bounds, but the size of the reformulation can be problematic. We focus on approach (iii) in which soft arc consistency (SAC) algorithms produce bounds of intermediate quality. Recently, the introduction of linear constraints as local cost functions increases their modeling expressiveness. We adapt an existing SAC algorithm to handle linear constraints. We show that our algorithm significantly improves the lower bounds compared to the original algorithm on several benchmarks, reducing solving time in some cases.",

Analyses reveal three insights: (1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2) larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing differentiation and decision usefulness.

    "abstract": "Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders \"out-of-the-box\" GPT unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an \"N-Plus-1\" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore, Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and pedagogical value.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on mathematical reasoning under well-posed conditions. However, real-world engineering problems require more than mathematical symbolic computation -- they need to deal with uncertainty, context, and open-ended scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to capture these complexities. We introduce EngiBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on solving engineering problems. It spans three levels of increasing difficulty (foundational knowledge retrieval, multi-step contextual reasoning, and open-ended modeling) and covers diverse engineering subfields. To facilitate a deeper understanding of model performance, we systematically rewrite each problem into three controlled variants (perturbed, knowledge-enhanced, and math abstraction), enabling us to separately evaluate the model's robustness, domain-specific knowledge, and mathematical reasoning abilities. Experiment results reveal a clear performance gap across levels: models struggle more as tasks get harder, perform worse when problems are slightly changed, and fall far behind human experts on the high-level engineering tasks. These findings reveal that current LLMs still lack the high-level reasoning needed for real-world engineering, highlighting the need for future models with deeper and more reliable problem-solving capabilities.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing research on bias in large language models (LLMs), most work has focused on gender and race, with little attention to religious identity. This paper explores how religion is internally represented in LLMs and how it intersects with concepts of violence and geography. Using mechanistic interpretability and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) via the Neuronpedia API, we analyze latent feature activations across five models. We measure overlap between religion- and violence-related prompts and probe semantic patterns in activation contexts. While all five religions show comparable internal cohesion, Islam is more frequently linked to features associated with violent language. In contrast, geographic associations largely reflect real-world religious demographics, revealing how models embed both factual distributions and cultural stereotypes. These findings highlight the value of structural analysis in auditing not just outputs but also internal representations that shape model behavior.",

In this paper, we analyze the problem hindering VLMs' spatial understanding abilities and propose SD-VLM, a novel framework that significantly enhances fundamental spatial perception abilities of VLMs through two key contributions: (1) propose Massive Spatial Measuring and Understanding (MSMU) dataset with precise spatial annotations, and (2) introduce a simple depth positional encoding method strengthening VLMs' spatial awareness. MSMU dataset covers massive quantitative spatial tasks with 700K QA pairs, 2.5M physical numerical annotations, and 10K chain-of-thought augmented samples. We have trained SD-VLM, a strong generalist VLM which shows superior quantitative spatial measuring and understanding capability. SD-VLM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on our proposed MSMU-Bench, but also shows spatial generalization abilities on other spatial understanding benchmarks including Q-Spatial and SpatialRGPT-Bench. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SD-VLM outperforms GPT-4o and Intern-VL3-78B by 26.91% and 25.56% respectively on MSMU-Bench.

    "abstract": "Building digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video presents an essential challenge in computer vision, which requires simultaneous reconstruction of object geometry, part segmentation, and articulation parameters from limited viewpoint inputs. Monocular video offers an attractive input format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging to disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision alone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed estimation. While motion priors from pre-trained tracking models can alleviate the issue, how to effectively integrate them for articulation learning remains largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce VideoArtGS, a novel approach that reconstructs high-fidelity digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video. We propose a motion prior guidance pipeline that analyzes 3D tracks, filters noise, and provides reliable initialization of articulation parameters. We also design a hybrid center-grid part assignment module for articulation-based deformation fields that captures accurate part motion. VideoArtGS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in articulation and mesh reconstruction, reducing the reconstruction error by about two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. VideoArtGS enables practical digital twin creation from monocular video, establishing a new benchmark for video-based articulated object reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Thanks to capability to alleviate the cost of large-scale annotation, few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has attracted increased attention of researchers in recent years. Existing FSAR approaches typically neglect the role of individual motion pattern in comparison, and under-explore the feature statistics for video dynamics. Thereby, they struggle to handle the challenging temporal misalignment in video dynamics, particularly by using 2D backbones. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes an adaptively aligned multi-scale second-order moment network, namely A$^2$M$^2$-Net, to describe the latent video dynamics with a collection of powerful representation candidates and adaptively align them in an instance-guided manner. To this end, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net involves two core components, namely, adaptive alignment (A$^2$ module) for matching, and multi-scale second-order moment (M$^2$ block) for strong representation. Specifically, M$^2$ block develops a collection of semantic second-order descriptors at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Furthermore, A$^2$ module aims to adaptively select informative candidate descriptors while considering the individual motion pattern. By such means, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net is able to handle the challenging temporal misalignment problem by establishing an adaptive alignment protocol for strong representation. Notably, our proposed method generalizes well to various few-shot settings and diverse metrics. The experiments are conducted on five widely used FSAR benchmarks, and the results show our A$^2$M$^2$-Net achieves very competitive performance compared to state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization.",

    "abstract": "As smart tourism evolves, AI-powered chatbots have become indispensable for delivering personalized, real-time assistance to travelers while promoting sustainability and efficiency. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate inputs to elicit unintended behaviors such as leaking sensitive information or generating harmful content. This paper presents a case study on the design and implementation of a secure retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot for Hsinchu smart tourism services. The system integrates RAG with API function calls, multi-layered linguistic analysis, and guardrails against injections, achieving high contextual awareness and security. Key features include a tiered response strategy, RAG-driven knowledge grounding, and intent decomposition across lexical, semantic, and pragmatic levels. Defense mechanisms include system norms, gatekeepers for intent judgment, and reverse RAG text to prioritize verified data. We also benchmark a GPT-5 variant (released 2025-08-07) to assess inherent robustness. Evaluations with 674 adversarial prompts and 223 benign queries show over 95% accuracy on benign tasks and substantial detection of injection attacks. GPT-5 blocked about 85% of attacks, showing progress yet highlighting the need for layered defenses. Findings emphasize contributions to sustainable tourism, multilingual accessibility, and ethical AI deployment.

The commercial models performed best across all tasks and scenarios, but a notable gap in ROUGE scores remains between simple and complex tasks. We also tested the models' robustness and found that their performance is negatively affected by noisy data.

Existing approaches face several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of parameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still depend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we propose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for battery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process. SeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the proposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging adaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit model (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together with the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic battery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves robust performance. Extensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets (TRI, RT-Batt, and NASA) demonstrate that SeqBattNet significantly outperforms classical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving consistently lower RMSE while maintaining computational efficiency.",

A central challenge of this task lies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply nested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where existing methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis, identifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current evaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is fine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve generation quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches that optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a structure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from rendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) answer visual questions by transferring information from images to text through a series of attention heads. While this image-to-text information flow is central to visual question answering, its underlying mechanism remains difficult to interpret due to the simultaneous operation of numerous attention heads. To address this challenge, we propose head attribution, a technique inspired by component attribution methods, to identify consistent patterns among attention heads that play a key role in information transfer. Using head attribution, we investigate how LVLMs rely on specific attention heads to identify and answer questions about the main object in an image. Our analysis reveals that a distinct subset of attention heads facilitates the image-to-text information flow. Remarkably, we find that the selection of these heads is governed by the semantic content of the input image rather than its visual appearance. We further examine the flow of information at the token level and discover that (1) text information first propagates to role-related tokens and the final token before receiving image information, and (2) image information is embedded in both object-related and background tokens. Our work provides evidence that image-to-text information flow follows a structured process, and that analysis at the attention-head level offers a promising direction toward understanding the mechanisms of LVLMs.",

    "abstract": "As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression. Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.",

    "abstract": "We define Agency as the emergent capacity of AI systems to function as autonomous agents actively discovering problems, formulating hypotheses, and executing solutions through self-directed engagement with environments and tools. This fundamental capability marks the dawn of the Age of AI Agency, driven by a critical industry shift: the urgent need for AI systems that don't just think, but work. While current AI excels at reasoning and generating responses, industries demand autonomous agents that can execute tasks, operate tools, and drive real-world outcomes. As agentic intelligence becomes the defining characteristic separating cognitive systems from productive workers, efficiently cultivating machine autonomy becomes paramount. Current approaches assume that more data yields better agency, following traditional scaling laws from language modeling. We fundamentally challenge this paradigm. LIMI (Less Is More for Intelligent Agency) demonstrates that agency follows radically different development principles. Through strategic focus on collaborative software development and scientific research workflows, we show that sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Using only 78 carefully designed training samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks, dramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%), DeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%). Most strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on 10,000 samples-achieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer samples. Our findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of high-quality agentic demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "The automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is in high clinical demand due to its prevalence and the importance of targeted treatment. Current clinical practice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images. However, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic models from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical models is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to mismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning data. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and QSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into a token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation for classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices of the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary segmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain nuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning, which improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of patients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes. Our approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These results highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR images.",

    "abstract": "Underwater object detection (UOD) remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to underwater distortions which degrade low-level features and compromise the reliability of even state-of-the-art detectors. While YOLO models have become the backbone of real-time object detection, little work has systematically examined their robustness under these uniquely challenging conditions. This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust when operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater environments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive evaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated underwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images from DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also analyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges, and color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall performance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and texture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images. Class imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3) image counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance, while object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we evaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection, which improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and fine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced domains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation, respectively. Together, these insights provide practical guidance for building resilient and cost-efficient UOD systems.",

Previous methods rely on labor-intensive supervision signals or target table data access permissions, limiting their usage in real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose an effective end-to-end ADP framework MontePrep, which enables training-free pipeline synthesis with zero target-instance requirements. MontePrep is formulated as an open-source large language model (LLM) powered tree-structured search problem. It consists of three pivot components, i.e., a data preparation action sandbox (DPAS), a fundamental pipeline generator (FPG), and an execution-aware pipeline optimizer (EPO). We first introduce DPAS, a lightweight action sandbox, to navigate the search-based pipeline generation. The design of DPAS circumvents exploration of infeasible pipelines. Then, we present FPG to build executable DP pipelines incrementally, which explores the predefined action sandbox by the LLM-powered Monte Carlo Tree Search. Furthermore, we propose EPO, which invokes pipeline execution results from sources to targets to evaluate the reliability of the generated pipelines in FPG. In this way, unreasonable pipelines are eliminated, thus facilitating the search process from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MontePrep with significant improvement against five state-of-the-art competitors.",

However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.",

Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.",

While software-level optimizations such as quantization and pruning reduce model size and computation, hardware acceleration has emerged as a decisive enabler for efficient embedded inference. This paper evaluates the impact of Neural Processing Units (NPUs) on MCU-based ML execution, using the ARM Cortex-M55 core combined with the Ethos-U55 NPU on the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble E7 development board as a representative platform. A rigorous measurement methodology was employed, incorporating per-inference net energy accounting via GPIO-triggered high-resolution digital multimeter synchronization and idle-state subtraction, ensuring accurate attribution of energy costs. Experimental results across six representative ML models -including MiniResNet, MobileNetV2, FD-MobileNet, MNIST, TinyYolo, and SSD-MobileNet-demonstrate substantial efficiency gains when inference is offloaded to the NPU. For moderate to large networks, latency improvements ranged from 7x to over 125x, with per-inference net energy reductions up to 143x. Notably, the NPU enabled execution of models unsupported on CPU-only paths, such as SSD-MobileNet, highlighting its functional as well as efficiency advantages. These findings establish NPUs as a cornerstone of energy-aware embedded AI, enabling real-time, power-constrained ML inference at the MCU level.",

Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\\ge3$) via multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.",

To achieve the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning\" framework for multimodal semi-supervised medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation from single-function tasks to competitive-programming problems, but existing multi-agent solutions either rely on costly large-scale ($>$ 30B) models or collapse when downsized to small open-source models. We present MapCoder-Lite, which upgrades a single 7B model into four role-specialised agents-retriever, planner, coder, and debugger-using only rank-32, role-specific LoRA adapters ($<3\\%$ extra parameters). Three lightweight techniques make this possible: (i) trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from $13.2\\%$ to $28.3\\%$), eliminates all format failures, and closes to within six points of a 32B baseline while cutting GPU memory and token-generation time by $4\\times$. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.",

To address this gap, we present ChartHal, a benchmark that features a fine-grained taxonomy of hallucination scenarios in chart understanding, along with a human-validated dataset of 1,062 samples. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LVLMs suffer from severe hallucinations on ChartHal, including proprietary models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini, which achieve only 34.46% and 22.79% accuracy, respectively. Further analysis reveals that questions involving information absent from or contradictory to charts are especially likely to trigger hallucinations, underscoring the urgent need for more robust mitigation strategies.

    "abstract": "Entity resolution plays a significant role in enterprise systems where data integrity must be rigorously maintained. Traditional methods often struggle with handling noisy data or semantic understanding, while modern methods suffer from computational costs or the excessive need for parallel computation. In this study, we introduce a scalable hybrid framework, which is designed to address several important problems, including scalability, noise robustness, and reliable results. We utilized a pre-trained language model to encode each structured data into corresponding semantic embedding vectors. Subsequently, after retrieving a semantically relevant subset of candidates, we apply a syntactic verification stage using fuzzy string matching techniques to refine classification on the unlabeled data. This approach was applied to a real-world entity resolution task, which exposed a linkage between a central user management database and numerous shared hosting server records. Compared to other methods, this approach exhibits an outstanding performance in terms of both processing time and robustness, making it a reliable solution for a server-side product. Crucially, this efficiency does not compromise results, as the system maintains a high retrieval recall of approximately 0.97. The scalability of the framework makes it deployable on standard CPU-based infrastructure, offering a practical and effective solution for enterprise-level data integrity auditing.",

To unify Intelligence Islands into one, we propose Pangaea, the first AI supercontinent akin to the geological Pangaea. Pangaea encodes any data into a unified format and accumulates universal knowledge through pre-training on 296 datasets across diverse modalities. Eventually, it demonstrates remarkable generalization across 45 general tasks and 15 scientific tasks encompassing a wide range of scientific subjects. By investigating Pangaea deeper, the scaling effect of modality is revealed, quantifying the universal knowledge accumulation across modalities as the cumulative distribution function of a geometric distribution. On the whole, Pangaea shows strong potential to handle myriad tasks, indicating a new direction toward artificial general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of facial recognition systems presents major privacy risks, driving the need for effective countermeasures. Current adversarial techniques apply generalized methods rather than adapting to individual facial characteristics, limiting their effectiveness and inconspicuousness. In this work, we introduce Layer Embedding Activation Mapping (LEAM), a novel technique that identifies which facial areas contribute most to recognition at an individual level. Unlike adversarial attack methods that aim to fool recognition systems, LEAM is an explainability technique designed to understand how these systems work, providing insights that could inform future privacy protection research. We integrate LEAM with a face parser to analyze data from 1000 individuals across 9 pre-trained facial recognition models.\n  Our analysis reveals that while different layers within facial recognition models vary significantly in their focus areas, these models generally prioritize similar facial regions across architectures when considering their overall activation patterns, which show significantly higher similarity between images of the same individual (Bhattacharyya Coefficient: 0.32-0.57) vs. different individuals (0.04-0.13), validating the existence of person-specific recognition patterns. Our results show that facial recognition models prioritize the central region of face images (with nose areas accounting for 18.9-29.7% of critical recognition regions), while still distributing attention across multiple facial fragments. Proper selection of relevant facial areas was confirmed using validation occlusions, based on just 1% of the most relevant, LEAM-identified, image pixels, which proved to be transferable across different models. Our findings establish the foundation for future individually tailored privacy protection systems centered around LEAM's choice of areas to be perturbed.",

    "abstract": "Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities due to content differences, which limited their robustness and generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the strong \\textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\\ours). Our method aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy labels between the domains. We then construct a \\textit{universal classifier} that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information, thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of \\textcolor{blue}{+7.9\\%}in H-score and \\textcolor{blue}{+6.1\\%} in H$^3$-score. Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and achieves an additional (\\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\\%}) increment in both H- and H$^3$-scores.",

SPICED comprises a novel synaptic network that enables dynamic expansion during continual adaptation through three bio-inspired neural mechanisms: (1) critical memory reactivation; (2) synaptic consolidation and (3) synaptic renormalization. The interplay within synaptic homeostasis dynamically strengthens task-discriminative memory traces and weakens detrimental memories. By integrating these mechanisms with continual learning system, SPICED preferentially replays task-discriminative memory traces that exhibit strong associations with newly emerging individuals, thereby achieving robust adaptations. Meanwhile, SPICED effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting by suppressing the replay prioritization of detrimental memories during long-term continual learning. Validated on three EEG datasets, SPICED show its effectiveness.",

In the current work, we designed a set of composite tasks inspired by common daily activities observed in early childhood development. Within a dynamic and simulated home environment, these tasks span three core domains: object understanding, spatial intelligence, and social activity. We evaluated 17 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks. The results consistently showed poor performance across all three domains, indicating a substantial gap between current capabilities and general intelligence requirements. Together, our tasks offer a preliminary framework for evaluating the general capabilities of embodied agents, marking an early but significant step toward the development of embodied MLLMs and their real-world deployment.",

This paper builds on and expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP) framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk. This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids, polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\\varepsilon$ trades conservatism for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.",

YOLOv10's architecture, featuring improvements like the CSPNet backbone, PAN for feature fusion, and Pyramid Spatial Attention Block, enables efficient and accurate object detection even in complex environments. The model was evaluated on the DeepFish and OpenImages V7-Fish datasets. Results show that YOLOv10-nano achieves a high detection accuracy with mAP50 of 0.966 and mAP50:95 of 0.606 while maintaining low computational demand (2.7M parameters, 8.4 GFLOPs). It also delivered an average inference speed of 29.29 FPS on the CPU, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Although OpenImages V7-Fish alone provided lower accuracy, it complemented DeepFish in enhancing model robustness. Overall, this study demonstrates YOLOv10-nano's potential for efficient, scalable marine fish monitoring and conservation applications in data-limited environments.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is currently a popular research area. Among its various branches, song generation has attracted growing interest. Despite the abundance of available songs, effective data preparation remains a significant challenge. Converting these songs into training-ready datasets typically requires extensive manual labeling, which is both time consuming and costly. To address this issue, we propose SongPrep, an automated preprocessing pipeline designed specifically for song data. This framework streamlines key processes such as source separation, structure analysis, and lyric recognition, producing structured data that can be directly used to train song generation models. Furthermore, we introduce SongPrepE2E, an end-to-end structured lyrics recognition model based on pretrained language models. Without the need for additional source separation, SongPrepE2E is able to analyze the structure and lyrics of entire songs and provide precise timestamps. By leveraging context from the whole song alongside pretrained semantic knowledge, SongPrepE2E achieves low Diarization Error Rate (DER) and Word Error Rate (WER) on the proposed SSLD-200 dataset. Downstream tasks demonstrate that training song generation models with the data output by SongPrepE2E enables the generated songs to closely resemble those produced by humans.",

This paper addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of 6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.",

While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.",

Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate, rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions, achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.",

    "abstract": "LLMs suffer from critical reasoning issues such as unfaithfulness, bias, and inconsistency, since they lack robust causal underpinnings and may rely on superficial correlations rather than genuine understanding. Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger causal foundations.

Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data. This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous methodology.

Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.",

In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of SimulST latency metrics across language pairs, systems, and both short- and long-form regimes. We uncover a structural bias in current metrics related to segmentation that undermines fair and meaningful comparisons.

In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Iterative Model Merging (AimMerging), a novel CL framework that utilizes learning and forgetting signals from the training trajectory to dynamically monitor the model's training status. Guided by dynamic monitoring, the training trajectory-guided merge controller adaptively determines the timing and frequency of iterative fusion, while the rehearsal-based knowledge fusion module computes the merging weights and executes the fusion. Comprehensive experiments on three CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that AimMerging achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 80% and 59% on FWT and BWT, respectively.

    "abstract": "Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs), hereafter LLM agents, leverage external tools to solve diverse tasks and interface with the real world. However, current training practices largely rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over static trajectories or reinforcement learning (RL) on narrow tasks, and generalize poorly beyond development settings, leading to brittleness with new tools and unseen workflows. Because code execution reflects many structures of real-world workflows, coding problems provide a natural basis for building agent training environments. Motivated by this, we introduce CodeGym, a scalable framework that synthesizes diverse, verifiable, and controllable multi-turn tool-use environments for agent RL, enabling LLM agents to explore and master various workflows actively. CodeGym rewrites static coding problems into interactive environments by extracting atomic functions or logic into callable tools, yielding verifiable tasks that span various tool-execution workflows. Models of varying sizes and chain-of-thought configurations, trained in CodeGym, exhibit consistent out-of-distribution generalizability; for example, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct achieves an absolute accuracy gain of 8.7 points on the OOD benchmark $τ$-Bench. These results highlight CodeGym as a step toward scalable general-purpose RL environments that align with real-world agent workflows.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its demand for multi-step reasoning and abstract conceptual integration. While recent test-time scaling techniques rely heavily on high-quality, challenging problems, the scarcity of Olympiad-level math problems remains a bottleneck. We introduce CogAtom, a novel cognitive atom-based framework for synthesizing mathematically rigorous and cognitively diverse problems. Unlike prior approaches, CogAtom models problem construction as a process of selecting and recombining fundamental reasoning units, cognitive atoms, extracted from human-authored solutions. A diversity-promoting random walk algorithm enables exploration of the cognitive atom space, while a constraint-based recombination mechanism ensures logical soundness and structural validity. The combinatorial nature of the graph structure provides a near-infinite space of reasoning paths, and the walk algorithm systematically explores this space to achieve large-scale synthesis of high-quality problems; meanwhile, by controlling the number of cognitive atoms, we can precisely adjust problem difficulty, ensuring diversity, scalability, and controllability of the generated problems. Experimental results demonstrate that CogAtom outperforms existing methods in accuracy, reasoning depth, and diversity, generating problems that closely match the difficulty of AIME while exceeding it in structural variation. Our work offers a cognitively grounded pathway toward scalable, high-quality math problem generation.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Icarus-1111/CogAtom.",

    "abstract": "Most languages lack sufficient data for large-scale monolingual pretraining, creating a \"data wall.\" Multilingual pretraining helps but is limited by language imbalance and the \"curse of multilinguality.\" An alternative is to translate high-resource text with machine translation (MT), which raises three questions: (1) How does MT-derived data scale with model capacity? (2) Can source-side transformations (e.g., simplifying English with an LLM) improve generalization to native text? (3) How well do models pretrained on MT-derived data adapt when continually trained on limited native text? We investigate these questions by translating English into Indonesian and Tamil--two typologically distant, lower-resource languages--and pretraining GPT-2 models (124M-774M) on native or MT-derived corpora from raw and LLM-simplified English. We evaluate cross-entropy loss on native text, along with accuracy on syntactic probes and downstream tasks. Our results show that (1) MT-pretrained models benefit from scaling; (2) source-side simplification harms generalization to native text; and (3) adapting MT-pretrained models on native text often yields better performance than native-only models, even with less native data. However, tasks requiring cultural nuance (e.g., toxicity detection) demand more exposure to native data.",

    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive, pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery, where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology, particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity. This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive distortions have been closely linked to mental health disorders, yet their automatic detection remained challenging due to contextual ambiguity, co-occurrence, and semantic overlap. We proposed a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which were processed by LLMs to infer multiple distortion instances, each with a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and LLM-inferred salience scores improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity. Our results suggested a psychologically grounded and generalizable approach for fine-grained reasoning in mental health NLP.",

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings. Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2) autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations. Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and context-aware environments.",

    "abstract": "By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing, which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized, giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.",

The sheer volume and inefficiencies of agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify, i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture, ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new agentic memory stores.",

    "abstract": "Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results.

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning. However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning, such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients' behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients. Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a Byzantine-free setting.",

The framework provides high-fidelity modeling of physical environments, traffic dynamics, and V2X networking, orchestrating these components through a unified core that synchronizes multiple simulators based on a single configuration file. Our implementation supports diverse perception-level attacks on LiDAR sensor data, along with communication-level threats such as V2X message manipulation and GPS spoofing. Furthermore, ROS 2 integration ensures seamless compatibility with third-party AV software stacks. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by evaluating the impact of generated adversarial scenarios on a state-of-the-art 3D object detector, revealing significant performance degradation under realistic conditions.",

However, their proficiency in complex causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact, including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control, military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i) reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under 10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits, then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry, with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24 graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and secure on-premise defense deployments.",

CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. We are able to achieve these improvements without any fine-tuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.",

    "abstract": "Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models (LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support. Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to support human learning. The source code is available on: https://github.com/lun-ai/LENS.git.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a unique \"Need-Seed\" agent-based system. The \"Need Agent\" uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the \"Seed Agent\" employs fine tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their technological capabilities. The system generates a \"Core Ontology Framework\" that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands (Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and real-world credibility.",

    "abstract": "Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority. These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which can limit the overall performance of the model.\n  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1 scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to be performed.\n  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that better aligns with the optimization objective.\n  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.\n  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.",

    "abstract": "The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence, this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms. Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure, through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable intelligent systems.",

    "abstract": "Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.",

To address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli (relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.",

Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge, LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources. Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation, this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However, these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT (Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens, each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.",

MedCOD integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999 English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23, chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the highest improvements.

However, systematically evaluating and enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional, systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms mitigate this issue by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, such methods typically handle knowledge as unstructured text, which reduces retrieval accuracy, hinders compositional reasoning, and amplifies the influence of irrelevant information on the factual consistency of LLM outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external knowledge retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's internal knowledge. The KG is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse Factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains in factual accuracy over baselines. Our findings reveal that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.",

We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.",

    "abstract": "The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables, with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i) Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model size. TinyMusician is the first mobile-deployable music generation model that eliminates cloud dependency while maintaining high audio fidelity and efficient resource usage",

However, redundant or weakly relevant feature components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals, we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for our method will be available at https://github.com/greatest-gourmet/Spotlighter.",

Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation.

The resulting model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.

In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications. Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization. Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.",

    "abstract": "Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind. This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.\n  The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume MCP if an application provides it.\n  To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.\n  A demo implementation of the proposed architecture can be found at https://github.com/hansvdam/langbar",

    "abstract": "Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050 adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual representations.

Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models. These results suggest that the apparent \"reasoning\" of VLMs often reflects prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.",

With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews, automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding & Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with 10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing classifier.

The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04% accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM) validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and hands-free control interfaces.",

It can even produce as good if not better output than the student's own work. However, there is a growing concern that over-reliance on using GenAI in this way will stifle the development of learning writing and critical thinking skills. How might this trend be reversed? What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g. note-taking while reading). I also discuss how else to design tools to think with that augments human cognition; where students learn more the skills of metacognition and reflection.",

While SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability, it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP. Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories.

While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training. We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors. Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.",

In this paper, we reconstruct the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as \"maximizing the difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true label's probability,\" and propose a gradient-based attack method termed Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer optimization framework of \"cycle-stage-step.\" The processes between cycles and between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels' probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of large-scale LoRaWAN networks requires jointly optimizing conflicting metrics like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Energy Efficiency (EE) by dynamically allocating transmission parameters, including Carrier Frequency, Spreading Factor, and Transmission Power. Existing methods often oversimplify this challenge, focusing on a single metric or lacking the adaptability needed for dynamic channel environments, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose two online learning-based resource allocation frameworks that intelligently navigate the PDR-EE trade-off. Our foundational proposal, D-LoRa, is a fully distributed framework that models the problem as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit. By decomposing the joint parameter selection and employing specialized, disaggregated reward functions, D-LoRa dramatically reduces learning complexity and enables nodes to autonomously adapt to network dynamics. To further enhance performance in LoRaWAN networks, we introduce CD-LoRa, a hybrid framework that integrates a lightweight, centralized initialization phase to perform a one-time, quasi-optimal channel assignment and action space pruning, thereby accelerating subsequent distributed learning. Extensive simulations and real-world field experiments demonstrate the superiority of our frameworks, showing that D-LoRa excels in non-stationary environments while CD-LoRa achieves the fastest convergence in stationary conditions. In physical deployments, our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, improving PDR by up to 10.8% and EE by 26.1%, confirming their practical effectiveness for scalable and efficient LoRaWAN networks.",

In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12 emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of 111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a 9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of emotionally aligned TTM systems.",

    "abstract": "Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories, the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world image quality variations.",

Three experimental setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short answers only, and long answers only.

We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics. Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.",

To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and incorporates knowledge synthesis to refine its understanding. At each iteration, the model formulates a reasoning-guided multi-query to explore multiple facets of knowledge. Subsequently, these queries drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, retrieving diverse knowledge. This retrieved knowledge is then synthesized to enrich the reasoning record, progressively deepening the model's understanding. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.",

Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture, TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner, T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM methods.",

    "abstract": "Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving MDPs with other fractional objectives.",

Automatically generating such opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with references to similar past cases. However, current research typically approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.

We present an energy-based model (EBM) that learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives, performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable foundation for safe RAG systems.",

    "abstract": "Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP ( NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data. 125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.",

To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.",

The proposed multiplier is employed within a custom convolution layer and evaluated on neural network tasks, including image recognition and denoising. Hardware evaluation demonstrates that the proposed design achieves up to 30.24% energy savings compared to the best among existing multipliers. In image denoising, the custom approximate convolution layer achieves improved Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to other approximate designs. Additionally, when applied to handwritten digit recognition, the model maintains high classification accuracy.

This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges.

    "abstract": "Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a \"roaring face\" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.",

However, concerns remain about potential biases related to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.",

While Pearl's $\\mathcal{DO}$-calculus provides a rigorous framework for causal inference, a parallel challenge lies in its physical implementation. Here, we apply and experimentally validate a quantum algorithmic framework for performing causal interventions. Our approach maps causal networks onto quantum circuits where probabilistic links are encoded by controlled-rotation gates, and interventions are realized by a structural remodeling of the circuit -- a physical analogue to Pearl's ``graph surgery''. We demonstrate the method's efficacy by resolving Simpson's Paradox in a 3-qubit model, and show its scalability by quantifying confounding bias in a 10-qubit healthcare simulation. Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle experimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully reproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference, offering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in algorithmic fairness and explainable AI (XAI).",

In this work, we present a framework for structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems. Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations. However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost. The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods. Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.",

    "abstract": "The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting, and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an inherent robustness.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information. By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities. All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes. The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps: analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points, significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches. Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\\% accuracy compared to 18.8\\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and effective AI systems for legal domain.",

However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.",

    "abstract": "The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular discovery.",

    "abstract": "Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training (e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic classification.",

    "abstract": "The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling, disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others. This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time. Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance. Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being in online environments.",

Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%, demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.",

We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation. VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056 molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of 8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor ($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns) confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.",

While uncensored models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1% strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics, virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods. This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.",

A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata, and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure. We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching, affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.

    "abstract": "Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning, which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish (vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions: baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens. Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of hardware vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for systematic and scalable analysis methods. Unlike software flaws, which are often patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across product lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices, and IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021) relied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and introduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for hardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose LLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction and refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and prompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying LLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742 hardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes, including privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in mobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven LLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy (99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our framework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses (MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our pipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis, thereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These results establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for systematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap between expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.",

    "abstract": "The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.",

    "abstract": "Humans can perform various combinations of physical skills without having to\nrelearn skills from scratch every single time. For example, we can swing a bat\nwhen walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing\nthe individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine\nor compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster\nwith fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional\napproach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning\nfor novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method\nis based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the\nfew-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal\nhere is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented\ntrajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the\nerror between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we\npropose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward\nKinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using\nour few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a\nreduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations.\nMoreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by\nteaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.",

On another is the increasing focus on the computational\nlimitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has\nbrought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to\novercome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns\nsimultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing\nconcerns about hallucinations?

    "abstract": "As AI systems increasingly integrate into critical societal sectors, the\ndemand for robust privacy-preserving methods has escalated. This paper\nintroduces Data Obfuscation through Latent Space Projection (LSP), a novel\ntechnique aimed at enhancing AI governance and ensuring Responsible AI\ncompliance. LSP uses machine learning to project sensitive data into a latent\nspace, effectively obfuscating it while preserving essential features for model\ntraining and inference. Unlike traditional privacy methods like differential\nprivacy or homomorphic encryption, LSP transforms data into an abstract,\nlower-dimensional form, achieving a delicate balance between data utility and\nprivacy. Leveraging autoencoders and adversarial training, LSP separates\nsensitive from non-sensitive information, allowing for precise control over\nprivacy-utility trade-offs. We validate LSP's effectiveness through experiments\non benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies: healthcare cancer\ndiagnosis and financial fraud analysis. Our results show LSP achieves high\nperformance (98.7% accuracy in image classification) while providing strong\nprivacy (97.3% protection against sensitive attribute inference), outperforming\ntraditional anonymization and privacy-preserving methods. The paper also\nexamines LSP's alignment with global AI governance frameworks, such as GDPR,\nCCPA, and HIPAA, highlighting its contribution to fairness, transparency, and\naccountability. By embedding privacy within the machine learning pipeline, LSP\noffers a promising approach to developing AI systems that respect privacy while\ndelivering valuable insights. We conclude by discussing future research\ndirections, including theoretical privacy guarantees, integration with\nfederated learning, and enhancing latent space interpretability, positioning\nLSP as a critical tool for ethical AI advancement.",

Recently, there has been\nincreasing interest in using diverse sensing modalities for beam management.\nHowever, it remains a big challenge to process multi-modal data efficiently and\nextract useful information. On the other hand, the recently emerging\nmulti-modal transformer (MMT) is a promising technique that can process\nmulti-modal data by capturing long-range dependencies. While MMT is highly\neffective in handling multi-modal data and providing robust beam management,\nintegrating reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their adaptability in\ndynamic environments. In this work, we propose a two-step beam management\nmethod by combining MMT with RL for dynamic beam index prediction. In the first\nstep, we divide available beam indices into several groups and leverage MMT to\nprocess diverse data modalities to predict the optimal beam group. In the\nsecond step, we employ RL for fast beam decision-making within each group,\nwhich in return maximizes throughput. Our proposed framework is tested on a 6G\ndataset. In this testing scenario, it achieves higher beam prediction accuracy\nand system throughput compared to both the MMT-only based method and the\nRL-only based method.",

When criminal court schedules are formed, defendants'\nscheduling preferences often take the least priority, although defendants may\nface significant consequences (including arrest or detention) for missed court\ndates. Additionally, studies indicate that defendants' nonappearances impose\ncosts on the courts and other system stakeholders. To address these issues,\ncourts and commentators have begun to recognize that pretrial outcomes for\ndefendants and for the system would be improved with greater attention to court\nprocesses, including \\emph{court scheduling practices}. There is thus a need\nfor fair criminal court pretrial scheduling systems that account for\ndefendants' preferences and availability, but the collection of such data poses\nlogistical challenges. Furthermore, optimizing schedules fairly across various\nparties' preferences is a complex optimization problem, even when such data is\navailable. In an effort to construct such a fair scheduling system under data\nuncertainty, this paper proposes a joint optimization and learning framework\nthat combines machine learning models trained end-to-end with efficient\nmatching algorithms. This framework aims to produce court scheduling schedules\nthat optimize a principled measure of fairness, balancing the availability and\npreferences of all parties.",

Although LSTMs have been employed to\neffectively capture the temporal nature of streaming data, they cannot handle\nthe dimension-varying streams in an online learning setting. Therefore, we\npropose a dynamic LSTM-based novel method, called packetLSTM, to model the\ndimension-varying streams. The packetLSTM's dynamic framework consists of an\nevolving packet of LSTMs, each dedicated to processing one input feature. Each\nLSTM retains the local information of its corresponding feature, while a shared\ncommon memory consolidates global information. This configuration facilitates\ncontinuous learning and mitigates the issue of forgetting, even when certain\nfeatures are absent for extended time periods. The idea of utilizing one LSTM\nper feature coupled with a dimension-invariant operator for information\naggregation enhances the dynamic nature of packetLSTM. This dynamic nature is\nevidenced by the model's ability to activate, deactivate, and add new LSTMs as\nrequired, thus seamlessly accommodating varying input dimensions. The\npacketLSTM achieves state-of-the-art results on five datasets, and its\nunderlying principle is extended to other RNN types, like GRU and vanilla RNN.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cognitive processes in multi-agent interactions is a primary\ngoal in cognitive science. It can guide the direction of artificial\nintelligence (AI) research toward social decision-making in multi-agent\nsystems, which includes uncertainty from character heterogeneity. In this\npaper, we introduce an episodic future thinking (EFT) mechanism for a\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent, inspired by cognitive processes observed in\nanimals. To enable future thinking functionality, we first develop a\nmulti-character policy that captures diverse characters with an ensemble of\nheterogeneous policies. Here, the character of an agent is defined as a\ndifferent weight combination on reward components, representing distinct\nbehavioral preferences. The future thinking agent collects observation-action\ntrajectories of the target agents and uses the pre-trained multi-character\npolicy to infer their characters. Once the character is inferred, the agent\npredicts the upcoming actions of target agents and simulates the potential\nfuture scenario. This capability allows the agent to adaptively select the\noptimal action, considering the predicted future scenario in multi-agent\ninteractions. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, we consider the multi-agent\nautonomous driving scenario with diverse driving traits and multiple particle\nenvironments. Simulation results demonstrate that the EFT mechanism with\naccurate character inference leads to a higher reward than existing multi-agent\nsolutions. We also confirm that the effect of reward improvement remains valid\nacross societies with different levels of character diversity.",

    "abstract": "Delirium is an acute confusional state that has been shown to affect up to\n31% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early detection of this\ncondition could lead to more timely interventions and improved health outcomes.\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown great potential for ICU\ndelirium prediction using structured electronic health records (EHR), most of\nthem have not explored the use of state-of-the-art AI models, have been limited\nto single hospitals, or have been developed and validated on small cohorts. The\nuse of large language models (LLM), models with hundreds of millions to\nbillions of parameters, with structured EHR data could potentially lead to\nimproved predictive performance. In this study, we propose DeLLiriuM, a novel\nLLM-based delirium prediction model using EHR data available in the first 24\nhours of ICU admission to predict the probability of a patient developing\ndelirium during the rest of their ICU admission. We develop and validate\nDeLLiriuM on ICU admissions from 104,303 patients pertaining to 195 hospitals\nacross three large databases: the eICU Collaborative Research Database, the\nMedical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV, and the University of\nFlorida Health's Integrated Data Repository. The performance measured by the\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that\nDeLLiriuM outperformed all baselines in two external validation sets, with 0.77\n(95% confidence interval 0.76-0.78) and 0.84 (95% confidence interval\n0.83-0.85) across 77,543 patients spanning 194 hospitals. To the best of our\nknowledge, DeLLiriuM is the first LLM-based delirium prediction tool for the\nICU based on structured EHR data, outperforming deep learning baselines which\nemploy structured features and can provide helpful information to clinicians\nfor timely interventions.",

More importantly, we systematically evaluate FairLoRA across various\nvision models, including ViT, DiNO, and CLIP, in scenarios involving\ndistribution shifts.

Currently, various EEG diagnostic algorithms\nbased on deep learning have been developed. However, most research efforts\nfocus solely on diagnosing and classifying current signal data but do not\nconsider the prediction of future trends for early warning. Additionally, since\nmulti-channel EEG can be essentially regarded as the spatio-temporal signal\ndata received by detectors at different locations in the brain, how to\nconstruct spatio-temporal information representations of EEG signals to\nfacilitate future trend prediction for multi-channel EEG becomes an important\nproblem.

The\nresults demonstrate that our method can accurately predict future trends for\nmulti-channel EEG signals simultaneously. Furthermore, the early warning\naccuracy for epilepsy seizures based on the generated EEG data reaches 0.89.

Using the CA subset,\nwe observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which is\npurely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal their\ninadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets,\nwe identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CS\nsubset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacks\ndepth in cultural understanding. We hope this work will not only help advance\nLMM performance in Japanese but also serve as a guideline to create\nhigh-standard, culturally diverse benchmarks for multilingual LMM development.\nThe project page is https://mmmu-japanese-benchmark.github.io/JMMMU/.",

To address this, recent work\nhas sought to integrate tactile sensing into policy learning.

In this work, we explore learning policies with magnetic skin\nsensors, which are inherently low-dimensional, highly sensitive, and\ninexpensive to integrate with robotic platforms. To leverage these sensors\neffectively, we present the Visuo-Skin (ViSk) framework, a simple approach that\nuses a transformer-based policy and treats skin sensor data as additional\ntokens alongside visual information. Evaluated on four complex real-world tasks\ninvolving credit card swiping, plug insertion, USB insertion, and bookshelf\nretrieval, ViSk significantly outperforms both vision-only and optical tactile\nsensing based policies.

    "abstract": "Informative path planning (IPP) is an important planning paradigm for various\nreal-world robotic applications such as environment monitoring. IPP involves\nplanning a path that can learn an accurate belief of the quantity of interest,\nwhile adhering to planning constraints. Traditional IPP methods typically\nrequire high computation time during execution, giving rise to reinforcement\nlearning (RL) based IPP methods. However, the existing RL-based methods do not\nconsider spatio-temporal environments which involve their own challenges due to\nvariations in environment characteristics. In this paper, we propose DyPNIPP, a\nrobust RL-based IPP framework, designed to operate effectively across\nspatio-temporal environments with varying dynamics. To achieve this, DyPNIPP\nincorporates domain randomization to train the agent across diverse\nenvironments and introduces a dynamics prediction model to capture and adapt\nthe agent actions to specific environment dynamics. Our extensive experiments\nin a wildfire environment demonstrate that DyPNIPP outperforms existing\nRL-based IPP algorithms by significantly improving robustness and performing\nacross diverse environment conditions.",

KANICE captures\ncomplex, non-linear data relationships while enabling dynamic,\ncontext-dependent feature extraction based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold\nrepresentation theorem. We evaluated KANICE on four datasets: MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and SVHN, comparing it against standard CNNs, CNN-KAN\nhybrids, and ICB variants. KANICE consistently outperformed baseline models,\nachieving 99.35% accuracy on MNIST and 90.05% on the SVHN dataset.\n  Furthermore, we introduce KANICE-mini, a compact variant designed for\nefficiency. A comprehensive ablation study demonstrates that KANICE-mini\nachieves comparable performance to KANICE with significantly fewer parameters.\nKANICE-mini reached 90.00% accuracy on SVHN with 2,337,828 parameters, compared\nto KANICE's 25,432,000. This study highlights the potential of KAN-based\narchitectures in balancing performance and computational efficiency in image\nclassification tasks.

Machine learning based methods for inverse folding typically\nuse recovery of the original sequence as the optimization objective. However,\ninverse folding is a one-to-many problem where several sequences can fold to\nthe same structure. Moreover, for many practical applications, it is often\ndesirable to have multiple, diverse sequences that fold into the target\nstructure since it allows for more candidate sequences for downstream\noptimizations.

To address this, we\npresent RL-DIF, a categorical diffusion model for inverse folding that is\npre-trained on sequence recovery and tuned via reinforcement learning on\nstructural consistency. We find that RL-DIF achieves comparable sequence\nrecovery and structural consistency to benchmark models but shows greater\nfoldable diversity: experiments show RL-DIF can achieve an foldable diversity\nof 29% on CATH 4.2, compared to 23% from models trained on the same dataset.\nThe PyTorch model weights and sampling code are available on GitHub.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has been widely studied in recent years.\nHowever, most existing MAPF algorithms assume that an agent occupies only a\nsingle grid in a grid-based map. This assumption limits their applicability in\nmany real-world domains where agents have geometric shapes, rather than being\npoint-like. Such agents, which can occupy multiple cells simultaneously, are\nreferred to as ``large'' agents. When considering the shape and size of agents\nin MAPF, the computational complexity increases significantly as the number of\nagents grows, primarily due to the increased overhead in conflict detection\nbetween geometric agents. In this paper, we propose two types of subproblems\nfor the LA-MAPF (Large-Agent MAPF) problem: \\textbf{cluster} (which has no\nconstraints on the order of solution) and \\textbf{level} (which imposes\nconstraints on the solution order). We introduce \\textbf{Layered LA-MAPF}, a\nmethod that decomposes a MAPF instance involving geometric agents into\nclusters, and then further decomposes each cluster into levels. This approach\naims to reduce time complexity when solving LA-MAPF problems. Our results\ndemonstrate the performance of our method as the number of agents increases\nacross various maps, and how it accelerates LA-MAPF methods, such as LA-CBS and\nLA-LaCAM. Experiments show that our LA-MAPF method with instance decomposition\n\\textbf{halves the time cost (reducing from an average of 40s to 20s) and\ntriples the success rate (from an average of 0.27 to 0.80)} in finding a\nsolution within 60 seconds.

To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or\npenetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and\nnetworks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown\npotential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is\ncurrently no comprehensive, open, automated, end-to-end penetration testing\nbenchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in\nsecurity contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based\nautomated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap.

Our findings reveal that while LLama 3.1\ndemonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of\nperforming end-to-end penetration testing even with some minimal human\nassistance. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies\nthat provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research\nilluminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g.\nenumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation.

There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain\nimaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic\nischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS),\nacute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain\natrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management\nand intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and\ndementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to support\nradiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We considered\ncommercially available software and research publications which identify at\nleast two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13\nresearch publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system were\navailable: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic and\nischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose of\npatient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally and\nlongitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequently\nanalysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVS\nwere each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commercially\navailable systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst research\nsystems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMH\nand atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVD\nmarkers are also of significance.

    "abstract": "AI systems crucially rely on human ratings, but these ratings are often\naggregated, obscuring the inherent diversity of perspectives in real-world\nphenomenon. This is particularly concerning when evaluating the safety of\ngenerative AI, where perceptions and associated harms can vary significantly\nacross socio-cultural contexts. While recent research has studied the impact of\ndemographic differences on annotating text, there is limited understanding of\nhow these subjective variations affect multimodal safety in generative AI. To\naddress this, we conduct a large-scale study employing highly-parallel safety\nratings of about 1000 text-to-image (T2I) generations from a demographically\ndiverse rater pool of 630 raters balanced across 30 intersectional groups\nacross age, gender, and ethnicity. Our study shows that (1) there are\nsignificant differences across demographic groups (including intersectional\ngroups) on how severe they assess the harm to be, and that these differences\nvary across different types of safety violations, (2) the diverse rater pool\ncaptures annotation patterns that are substantially different from expert\nraters trained on specific set of safety policies, and (3) the differences we\nobserve in T2I safety are distinct from previously documented group level\ndifferences in text-based safety tasks. To further understand these varying\nperspectives, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the open-ended explanations\nprovided by raters. This analysis reveals core differences into the reasons why\ndifferent groups perceive harms in T2I generations. Our findings underscore the\ncritical need for incorporating diverse perspectives into safety evaluation of\ngenerative AI ensuring these systems are truly inclusive and reflect the values\nof all users.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\npotential in code generation tasks, they often encounter issues such as refusal\nto code or hallucination in geospatial code generation due to a lack of\ndomain-specific knowledge and code corpora. To address these challenges, this\npaper presents and open-sources the GeoCode-PT and GeoCode-SFT corpora, along\nwith the GeoCode-Eval evaluation dataset. Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA and\nLoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the first\nLLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B.\nFurthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework,\nincorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering\nscoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the\nGeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results show that GeoCode-GPT outperforms\nother models in multiple-choice accuracy by 9.1% to 32.1%, in code\nsummarization ability by 1.7% to 25.4%, and in code generation capability by\n1.2% to 25.1%.

The study of social creak has\nbeen previously conducted by combining perceptual evaluation of speech with\nconventional acoustical parameters such as the harmonic-to-noise ratio and\ncepstral peak prominence. In the current study, machine learning (ML) was used\nto automatically distinguish speech of low amount of social creak from speech\nof high amount of social creak.\n  Methods: The amount of creak in continuous speech samples produced in Finnish\nby 90 female speakers was first perceptually assessed by two voice specialists.\nBased on their assessments, the speech samples were divided into two categories\n(low $vs$. high amount of creak). Using the speech signals and their creak\nlabels, seven different ML models were trained. Three spectral representations\nwere used as feature for each model.\n  Results: The results show that the best performance (accuracy of 71.1\\%) was\nobtained by the following two systems: an Adaboost classifier using the\nmel-spectrogram feature and a decision tree classifier using the mel-frequency\ncepstral coefficient feature.\n  Conclusions: The study of social creak is becoming increasingly popular in\nsociolinguistic and vocological research. The conventional human perceptual\nassessment of the amount of creak is laborious and therefore ML technology\ncould be used to assist researchers studying social creak. The classification\nsystems reported in this study could be considered as baselines in future\nML-based studies on social creak.",

However, few works have explored how\nmath reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can\nbe isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to\nimprove math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster\nunderstanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math\nNeurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate\nmath-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on\nexisting work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter\nimportance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those\nimportant for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro\nidentifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly\nimpacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a\nsmall constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by\n4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered.\nMathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when\nidentifying math-specific parameters using a single sample.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become indispensable for managing and\nprocessing the vast amounts of data generated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOntology, which formalizes knowledge within a domain using standardized\nvocabularies and relationships, plays a crucial role in AI by enabling\nautomated reasoning, data integration, semantic interoperability, and\nextracting meaningful insights from extensive datasets. The diversity of\nCOVID-19 datasets poses challenges in comprehending this information for both\nhuman and machines. Existing COVID-19 ontologies are designed to address\nspecific aspects of the pandemic but lack comprehensive coverage across all\nessential dimensions. To address this gap, CODO, an integrated ontological\nmodel has been developed encompassing critical facets of COVID-19 information\nsuch as aetiology, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis,\nprevention, genomics, therapeutic safety, and more. This paper reviews CODO\nsince its inception in 2020, detailing its developments and highlighting CODO\nas a tool for the aggregation, representation, analysis, and visualization of\ndiverse COVID-19 data. The major contribution of this paper is to provide a\nsummary of the development of CODO, and outline the overall development and\nevaluation approach. By adhering to best practices and leveraging W3C\nstandards, CODO ensures data integration and semantic interoperability,\nsupporting effective navigation of COVID-19 complexities across various\ndomains.",

One notably promising application of LLM\nagents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can\ngenerate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial\nflexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face\nchallenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different\nenvironments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches\ntypically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific\npolicy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating\ncode actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when\nconfronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the\ngeneralizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves\nthe retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source\nenvironments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's\nadaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights\nfrom multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental\nconstraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic\nmanipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic\nmanipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a series\nof interviews with clinicians in the UK. Our study: (i) explores the potential\nfor AI, specifically future 'human-like' computing approaches, to facilitate\nECG interpretation and support clinical decision making, and (ii) elicits their\nopinions about the importance of explainability and trustworthiness of AI\nalgorithms. Results: We performed inductive thematic analysis on interview\ntranscriptions from 23 clinicians and identified the following themes: (i) a\nlack of trust in current systems, (ii) positive attitudes towards future AI\napplications and requirements for these, (iii) the relationship between the\naccuracy and explainability of algorithms, and (iv) opinions on education,\npossible deskilling, and the impact of AI on clinical competencies. Discussion:\nClinicians do not trust current computerised methods, but welcome future 'AI'\ntechnologies. Where clinicians trust future AI interpretation to be accurate,\nthey are less concerned that it is explainable. They also preferred ECG\ninterpretation that demonstrated the results of the algorithm visually. Whilst\nclinicians do not fear job losses, they are concerned about deskilling and the\nneed to educate the workforce to use AI responsibly. Conclusion: Clinicians are\npositive about the future application of AI in clinical decision-making.\nAccuracy is a key factor of uptake and visualisations are preferred over\ncurrent computerised methods. This is viewed as a potential means of training\nand upskilling, in contrast to the deskilling that automation might be\nperceived to bring.",

However, GNNs perform poorly in the Few-Shot Node\nClassification (FSNC) task that requires robust generalization to make accurate\npredictions for unseen classes with limited labels. To tackle the challenge, we\npropose the integration of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)--a technique\ndesigned to enhance model generalization by finding a flat minimum of the loss\nlandscape--into GNN training. The standard SAM approach, however, consists of\ntwo forward-backward steps in each training iteration, doubling the\ncomputational cost compared to the base optimizer (e.g., Adam). To mitigate\nthis drawback, we introduce a novel algorithm, Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (FGSAM), that integrates the rapid training of Multi-Layer\nPerceptrons (MLPs) with the superior performance of GNNs. Specifically, we\nutilize GNNs for parameter perturbation while employing MLPs to minimize the\nperturbed loss so that we can find a flat minimum with good generalization more\nefficiently. Moreover, our method reutilizes the gradient from the perturbation\nphase to incorporate graph topology into the minimization process at almost\nzero additional cost. To further enhance training efficiency, we develop FGSAM+\nthat executes exact perturbations periodically. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the standard SAM with lower\ncomputational costs in FSNC tasks. In particular, our FGSAM+ as a SAM variant\noffers a faster optimization than the base optimizer in most cases. In addition\nto FSNC, our proposed methods also demonstrate competitive performance in the\nstandard node classification task for heterophilic graphs, highlighting the\nbroad applicability.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to solve the\nproblem of finding obstacle-free paths for autonomous agents operating in\nstochastic and uncertain environments. However, when the underlying stochastic\ndynamics of the environment experiences drastic distribution shifts, the\noptimal policy obtained in the trained environment may be sub-optimal or may\nentirely fail in helping find goal-reaching paths for the agent. Approaches\nlike domain randomization and robust RL can provide robust policies, but\ntypically assume minor (bounded) distribution shifts. For substantial\ndistribution shifts, retraining (either with a warm-start policy or from\nscratch) is an alternative approach. In this paper, we develop a novel approach\ncalled {\\em Evolutionary Robust Policy Optimization} (ERPO), an adaptive\nre-training algorithm inspired by evolutionary game theory (EGT). ERPO learns\nan optimal policy for the shifted environment iteratively using a temperature\nparameter that controls the trade off between exploration and adherence to the\nold optimal policy. The policy update itself is an instantiation of the\nreplicator dynamics used in EGT. We show that under fairly common sparsity\nassumptions on rewards in such environments, ERPO converges to the optimal\npolicy in the shifted environment. We empirically demonstrate that for path\nfinding tasks in a number of environments, ERPO outperforms several popular RL\nand deep RL algorithms (PPO, A3C, DQN) in many scenarios and popular\nenvironments. This includes scenarios where the RL algorithms are allowed to\ntrain from scratch in the new environment, when they are retrained on the new\nenvironment, or when they are used in conjunction with domain randomization.\nERPO shows faster policy adaptation, higher average rewards, and reduced\ncomputational costs in policy adaptation.",

Automatic text summarization seeks to tackle\nthis by slimming large texts down into more manageable summaries. This\nimportant research area can aid in decision-making by digging out salient\ncontent from large text. With the progress in deep learning models, significant\nwork in language models has emerged. The encoder-decoder framework in deep\nlearning has become the central approach for automatic text summarization. This\nwork leverages transformer-based BART model for human-like summarization which\nis an open-ended problem with many challenges. On training and fine-tuning the\nencoder-decoder model, it is tested with diverse sample articles and the\nquality of summaries of diverse samples is assessed based on human evaluation\nparameters. Further, the finetuned model performance is compared with the\nbaseline pretrained model based on evaluation metrics like ROUGE score and\nBERTScore. Additionally, domain adaptation of the model is required for\nimproved performance of abstractive summarization of dialogues between\ninterlocutors. On investigating, the above popular evaluation metrics are found\nto be insensitive to factual errors. Further investigation of the summaries\ngenerated by finetuned model is done using the contemporary evaluation metrics\nof factual consistency like WeCheck and SummaC.

In this\npaper, we introduce PerspectiveNet, a lightweight yet efficient model for\ngenerating long descriptions across multiple camera views. Our approach\nutilizes a vision encoder, a compact connector module to convert visual\nfeatures into a fixed-size tensor, and large language models (LLMs) to harness\nthe strong natural language generation capabilities of LLMs. The connector\nmodule is designed with three main goals: mapping visual features onto LLM\nembeddings, emphasizing key information needed for description generation, and\nproducing a fixed-size feature matrix. Additionally, we augment our solution\nwith a secondary task, the correct frame sequence detection, enabling the model\nto search for the correct sequence of frames to generate descriptions. Finally,\nwe integrate the connector module, the secondary task, the LLM, and a visual\nfeature extraction model into a single architecture, which is trained for the\nTraffic Safety Description and Analysis task.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning\nfrom graph-structured data.

On the other hand, we empirically observe that\nfor existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across\ndiverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler\nfor multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple\nGNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then,\nthrough LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM,\ninjecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN\nto ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading\nto a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph\nstructural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms\nexisting models.

This has motivated the community to develop effective methods to\ndistill pre-trained diffusion models into more efficient models, but these\nmethods still typically require few-step inference or perform substantially\nworse than the underlying model. In this paper, we present Score Implicit\nMatching (SIM) a new approach to distilling pre-trained diffusion models into\nsingle-step generator models, while maintaining almost the same sample\ngeneration ability as the original model as well as being data-free with no\nneed of training samples for distillation. The method rests upon the fact that,\nalthough the traditional score-based loss is intractable to minimize for\ngenerator models, under certain conditions we can efficiently compute the\ngradients for a wide class of score-based divergences between a diffusion model\nand a generator. SIM shows strong empirical performances for one-step\ngenerators: on the CIFAR10 dataset, it achieves an FID of 2.06 for\nunconditional generation and 1.96 for class-conditional generation. Moreover,\nby applying SIM to a leading transformer-based diffusion model, we distill a\nsingle-step generator for text-to-image (T2I) generation that attains an\naesthetic score of 6.42 with no performance decline over the original\nmulti-step counterpart, clearly outperforming the other one-step generators\nincluding SDXL-TURBO of 5.33, SDXL-LIGHTNING of 5.34 and HYPER-SDXL of 5.85.

However, effectively integrating recommender system\nknowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards\nrecommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge\nby making two key contributions.\n  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation\ntasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with\nGEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich\nuser narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences,\nproduct endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase\nhistory. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research.\nFurthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and\nperform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second,\nthe paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves\nas a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first\nattempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender\nsignals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can\neffectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based\nCF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and\npersonalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining\nCF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language\nmetrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also\nprovide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to\nthis new generative task.",

    "abstract": "Human action recognition (HAR) plays a key role in various applications such\nas video analysis, surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare.\nMost HAR algorithms are developed from RGB images, which capture detailed\nvisual information. However, these algorithms raise concerns in\nprivacy-sensitive environments due to the recording of identifiable features.\nEvent cameras offer a promising solution by capturing scene brightness changes\nsparsely at the pixel level, without capturing full images. Moreover, event\ncameras have high dynamic ranges that can effectively handle scenarios with\ncomplex lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast environments.\nHowever, using event cameras introduces challenges in modeling the spatially\nsparse and high temporal resolution event data for HAR. To address these\nissues, we propose the SpikMamba framework, which combines the energy\nefficiency of spiking neural networks and the long sequence modeling capability\nof Mamba to efficiently capture global features from spatially sparse and high\na temporal resolution event data. Additionally, to improve the locality of\nmodeling, a spiking window-based linear attention mechanism is used. Extensive\nexperiments show that SpikMamba achieves remarkable recognition performance,\nsurpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.45%, 7.22%, 0.15%, and 3.92% on\nthe PAF, HARDVS, DVS128, and E-FAction datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is widely recognized for its robust performance\nacross a range of deep reinforcement learning tasks, where it leverages the\ntanh transformation to constrain actions within bounded limits. However, this\ntransformation induces a distribution shift, distorting the original Gaussian\naction distribution and potentially leading the policy to select suboptimal\nactions, particularly in high-dimensional action spaces. In this paper, we\nconduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of this distribution\nshift, deriving the precise probability density function (PDF) for actions\nfollowing the tanh transformation to clarify the misalignment introduced\nbetween the transformed distribution's mode and the intended action output. We\nsubstantiate these theoretical insights through extensive experiments on\nhigh-dimensional tasks within the HumanoidBench benchmark. Our findings\nindicate that accounting for this distribution shift substantially enhances\nSAC's performance, resulting in notable improvements in cumulative rewards,\nsample efficiency, and reliability across tasks. These results underscore a\ncritical consideration for SAC and similar algorithms: addressing\ntransformation-induced distribution shifts is essential to optimizing policy\neffectiveness in high-dimensional deep reinforcement learning environments,\nthereby expanding the robustness and applicability of SAC in complex control\ntasks.",

To minimize the cost of the AI inference task\nsubject to requirements on latency, quality, and - crucially - reliability of\nthe inference process, it is vital to optimize (i) the set of sensors/data\nsources and (ii) the DNN architecture, (iii) the network nodes executing\nsections of the DNN, and (iv) the resources to use.

Some prior work\nwarns of \"model collapse\" as the web is overwhelmed by synthetic data; other\nwork suggests the problem can be contained (i.e. collapse can be avoided) by\nmanaging how available data are used in pretraining. In this paper, we report\nexperiments on three ways of using data (training-workflows), across three\ngenerative model task-settings (multivariate Gaussian estimation, kernel\ndensity estimation, and language-model fine-tuning) to further confirm the\npossibility of containment: (a) we confirm that the training-workflow of {\\it\nreplacing} all real data by successive generations of purely synthetic data\nindeed suffers model collapse in all task-settings studied; (b) we consider the\ntraining-workflow of {\\it accumulating} synthetic data alongside real data and\ntraining on all data combined and confirming that, although the proportion of\nreal data eventually becomes zero, models remain stable and their test losses\ndo not diverge under this training-workflow; (c) we consider a\ntraining-workflow where real and synthetic data accumulate together but\nsuccessive generations of pretraining are constrained to use fixed-size data\nsubsets each generation. In this workflow, we observe slow and gradual rather\nthan explosive degradation of test loss performance across generations.

    "abstract": "Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building\nhighly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al.,\n2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et\nal., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly\nused as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built\nupon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading\nto suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose\nGradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of\ngradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm\nregularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection\ninstead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates\nsamples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can\nbe further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we\ndemonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection\nbenchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive\nalgorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data\nto achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks",

    "abstract": "Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is\ncritical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon\nthat enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nmethods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of\nsamples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we\nintroduce a training-free method to \\textbf{DEA}ctivate the fairness and\nprivacy coupled \\textbf{N}eurons (\\textbf{DEAN}), which theoretically and\nempirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy\nawareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DEAN eliminates the\ntrade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy\nawareness simultaneously, \\eg improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness\nby 12.2\\% and privacy awareness by 14.0\\%. More crucially, DEAN remains robust\nand effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious\nfine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly\nin such scenarios. We hope this study provides valuable insights into\nconcurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be\nintegrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and\nresponsible AI systems.

    "abstract": "Sequential reasoning in agent systems has been significantly advanced by\nlarge language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches face limitations.\nReflection-driven reasoning relies solely on knowledge in pretrained models,\nlimiting performance in novel scenarios, while experience-assisted reasoning\noften depends on external experiences and lacks clear principles for selecting\nrepresentative experiences. We address these limitations by proposing CoPS\n(Cross-Task Experience Sharing), a generalizable algorithm that enhances\nsequential reasoning by cross-task experience sharing and selection. In detail,\nCoPS leverages agents' experiences on previous tasks, selecting\ndistribution-matched experiences via a provable pessimism-based strategy to\nmaximize utility while minimizing risks from distribution shifts. Extensive\nexperimental results on benchmarks like Alfworld, Webshop, and HotPotQA\ndemonstrate that CoPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with\nsuperior sample efficiency suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.\nTheoretically, we show that the performance of our algorithm depends on both\nthe quality of the pretrained LLM and the matching between the agent's\ntask-dependent trial distribution and that generated by the LLM. Our work\nbridges the gap between existing sequential reasoning paradigms and validates\nthe effectiveness of leveraging cross-task experiences, shedding light on the\npotential to improve agents' generalization and adaptability across diverse\ntasks.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we first show that increases in beam size of even just\nsmall-sized LLM (1B-7B parameters) require an extensive GPU resource\nconsumption, leading to up to 80% of recurring crashes due to memory overloads\nin LLM-based APR. Seemingly simple solutions to reduce memory consumption are\n(1) to quantize LLM models, i.e., converting the weights of a LLM from\nhigh-precision values to lower-precision ones. and (2) to make beam search\nsequential, i.e., forwarding each beam through the model sequentially and then\nconcatenate them back into a single model output. However, we show that these\napproaches still do not work via both theoretical analysis and experiments. To\naddress this, we introduce FLAMES, a novel LLM-based APR technique that employs\nsemantic-guided patch generation to enhance repair effectiveness and memory\nefficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on beam search, FLAMES\nutilizes greedy decoding to enhance memory efficiency while steering the search\nto more potentially good repair candidates via a semantic-guided best-first\nsearch algorithm. At each decoding step, FLAMES uses semantic feedback from\ntest validation such as the number of passing and failing test cases to select\nthe most promising token to explore further. Our empirical evaluation on the\nDefects4J and HumanEval-Java datasets shows that FLAMES not only substantially\nreduces memory consumption by up to 83% compared to conventional LLM-based APR,\nbut also accelerates the repair process. Remarkably, FLAMES successfully\ngenerated 133 and 103 correct fixes for 333 and 163 bugs in the Defects4J and\nHumanEval-Java datasets, respectively. This suggests that FLAMES is not only\nmore efficient but also outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, fixing at\nleast 10 and 11 more bugs than SOTA baselines in the Defects4J and\nHumanEval-Java datasets, respectively.",

However, current deep learning-based AAR models are trained\nsolely on datasets of individual animal species, constraining their\napplicability in practice and performing poorly when training data are limited.\nIn this study, we propose a one-for-many framework, dubbed Cross-species\nKnowledge Sharing and Preserving (CKSP), based on sensor data of diverse animal\nspecies. Given the coexistence of generic and species-specific behavioural\npatterns among different species, we design a Shared-Preserved Convolution\n(SPConv) module. This module assigns an individual low-rank convolutional layer\nto each species for extracting species-specific features and employs a shared\nfull-rank convolutional layer to learn generic features, enabling the CKSP\nframework to learn inter-species complementarity and alleviating data\nlimitations via increasing data diversity. Considering the training conflict\narising from discrepancies in data distributions among species, we devise a\nSpecies-specific Batch Normalization (SBN) module, that involves multiple BN\nlayers to separately fit the distributions of different species.

Despite the availability of\nvarious offline-feature-extractors that offer diverse information from\ndifferent perspectives, they have several limitations due to fixed parameters.\nConcretely, these extractors are solely pre-trained on image/video\ncomprehension tasks, making them less adaptable to video caption datasets.\nAdditionally, most of these extractors only capture features prior to the\nclassifier of the pre-training task, ignoring a significant amount of valuable\nshallow information. Furthermore, employing multiple offline-features may\nintroduce redundant information. To address these issues, we propose an\nend-to-end encoder-decoder-based network (EVC-MF) for video captioning, which\nefficiently utilizes multi-scale visual and textual features to generate video\ndescriptions. Specifically, EVC-MF consists of three modules.

Secondly, we fuse the multi-scale features and\ninput them into a masked encoder to reduce redundancy and encourage learning\nuseful features.

    "abstract": "We frame code generation as a black-box optimization problem within the code\nspace and demonstrate how optimization-inspired techniques can enhance\ninference scaling. Based on this perspective, we propose SCATTERED FOREST\nSEARCH (SFS), a novel approach that improves solution diversity and better\nexploits feedback during evolutionary search. Our theoretical analysis\nillustrates how these methods help avoid local optima during optimization,\nleading to more efficient exploration. Extensive experiments on HumanEval,\nMBPP, APPS, CodeContests, and Leetcode reveal significant performance gains.\nFor instance, our method achieves a pass@1 rate of 67.1% on HumanEval+ and\n87.2% on HumanEval with GPT-3.5, marking improvements of 8.6% and 4.3% over the\nstate-of-the-art, while also halving the iterations needed to find the correct\nsolution. Furthermore, our approach scales more efficiently than existing\nsearch techniques, including tree search, line search, and repeated sampling.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure\nstatus of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at\nproviding timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect\ninterictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural\nnetwork (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time\npreliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible\npathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments\nusing multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of\nepileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The\nSNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed\nto process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower\nenergy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it\nan ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our\nproposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying\nictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average\npower consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when\ndeployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance\nwhen tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure\ndetection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable\ndevices in the future.",

    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation is a crucial machine learning topic, as it\ncontains numerous applications in the real world, particularly with respect to\ndata privacy. Existing approaches predominantly focus on Euclidean data, such\nas images and videos, while the exploration of non-Euclidean graph data remains\nscarce. Recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches can suffer from serious\nperformance decline due to domain shift and label scarcity in source-free\nadaptation scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel method named Graph\nDiffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw (GALA), tailored for source-free graph\ndomain adaptation. To achieve domain alignment, GALA employs a graph diffusion\nmodel to reconstruct source-style graphs from target data. Specifically, a\nscore-based graph diffusion model is trained using source graphs to learn the\ngenerative source styles. Then, we introduce perturbations to target graphs via\na stochastic differential equation instead of sampling from a prior, followed\nby the reverse process to reconstruct source-style graphs. We feed the\nsource-style graphs into an off-the-shelf GNN and introduce class-specific\nthresholds with curriculum learning, which can generate accurate and unbiased\npseudo-labels for target graphs. Moreover, we develop a simple yet effective\ngraph-mixing strategy named graph jigsaw to combine confident graphs and\nunconfident graphs, which can enhance generalization capabilities and\nrobustness via consistency learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of GALA.",

Large language models (LLMs) have\nrevolutionized this field by capturing nuanced language patterns. However,\nadapting LLMs to domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks remains challenging\ndue to computational constraints and the need for optimal fine-tuning. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Adaptive Rank Space\nExploration (DARSE) framework for efficient and effective sentiment analysis\nusing LLMs. DARSE consists of a coarse-grained greedy algorithm to identify the\noptimal rank range, a fine-grained exploration algorithm to refine rank\nselection, and a dynamic rank allocation method to determine the optimal rank\ncombination for each LLM layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARSE\nsignificantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy, achieving a 15.1%\nimprovement in MSE and a 4.3% improvement in accuracy compared to previous\nwork. Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and\nmodel performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with\nLLMs.",

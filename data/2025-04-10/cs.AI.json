      "abstract": "The predictions of click through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) play a\ncrucial role in the success of ad-recommendation systems. A Deep Hierarchical\nEnsemble Network (DHEN) has been proposed to integrate multiple feature\ncrossing modules and has achieved great success in CTR prediction. However, its\nperformance for CVR prediction is unclear in the conversion ads setting, where\nan ad bids for the probability of a user's off-site actions on a third party\nwebsite or app, including purchase, add to cart, sign up, etc. A few challenges\nin DHEN: 1) What feature-crossing modules (MLP, DCN, Transformer, to name a\nfew) should be included in DHEN? 2) How deep and wide should DHEN be to achieve\nthe best trade-off between efficiency and efficacy? 3) What hyper-parameters to\nchoose in each feature-crossing module? Orthogonal to the model architecture,\nthe input personalization features also significantly impact model performance\nwith a high degree of freedom. In this paper, we attack this problem and\npresent our contributions biased to the applied data science side, including:\n  First, we propose a multitask learning framework with DHEN as the single\nbackbone model architecture to predict all CVR tasks, with a detailed study on\nhow to make DHEN work effectively in practice; Second, we build both on-site\nreal-time user behavior sequences and off-site conversion event sequences for\nCVR prediction purposes, and conduct ablation study on its importance; Last but\nnot least, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary loss to predict future\nactions in the input sequence, to help resolve the label sparseness issue in\nCVR prediction.\n  Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single\nfeature crossing modules with pre-trained user personalization features.",

      "abstract": "Algorithms and approaches for continual reinforcement learning have gained\nincreasing attention. Much of this early progress rests on the foundations and\nstandard practices of traditional reinforcement learning, without questioning\nif they are well-suited to the challenges of continual learning agents. We\nsuggest that many core foundations of traditional RL are, in fact, antithetical\nto the goals of continual reinforcement learning. We enumerate four such\nfoundations: the Markov decision process formalism, a focus on optimal\npolicies, the expected sum of rewards as the primary evaluation metric, and\nepisodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations.\nShedding such sacredly held and taught concepts is not easy. They are\nself-reinforcing in that each foundation depends upon and holds up the others,\nmaking it hard to rethink each in isolation. We propose an alternative set of\nall four foundations that are better suited to the continual learning setting.\nWe hope to spur on others in rethinking the traditional foundations, proposing\nand critiquing alternatives, and developing new algorithms and approaches\nenabled by better-suited foundations.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, Language Models (LMs) have shown par-human\ncapabilities in several domains. Despite their practical applications and\nexceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious\ninput exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended\nbehavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as\nadversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is\nchallenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak,\nwhich results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we\npropose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models\n(SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel,\nexplainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research\nsuggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding\nand explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the\nsemantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated\nagainst existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that\nSLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection\nperformance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot\ndetectors.To further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we\ngenerate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark\ndataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed AttentionDefense approach performs robustly on this novel\njailbreak dataset while existing approaches suffer in performance.\nAdditionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as\nit has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM\ndetector.",

To address these challenges, there is a notable shift\nfrom monolithic models to compound AI systems, with the premise of more\npowerful, versatile, and reliable applications.

      "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks, which aim to cause LLMs to perform unrestricted behaviors,\nhave become a critical and challenging direction in AI safety. Despite\nachieving the promising attack success rate using dictionary-based evaluation,\nexisting jailbreak attack methods fail to output detailed contents to satisfy\nthe harmful request, leading to poor performance on GPT-based evaluation. To\nthis end, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack termed GeneShift, by using a\ngenetic algorithm to optimize the scenario shifts. Firstly, we observe that the\nmalicious queries perform optimally under different scenario shifts. Based on\nit, we develop a genetic algorithm to evolve and select the hybrid of scenario\nshifts. It guides our method to elicit detailed and actionable harmful\nresponses while keeping the seemingly benign facade, improving stealthiness.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GeneShift. Notably,\nGeneShift increases the jailbreak success rate from 0% to 60% when direct\nprompting alone would fail.",

However, this\ntask presents several challenges, including extracting textual features that\ncontain relevant information about fake news.

In\nthis study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama,\nGrok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the\nDivergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary\nto expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over\nthe past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies.\nFor the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the\naverage human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of\nLLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks.\nBeyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model\nvariability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging\nfrom below-average to original. This variability has important implications for\nboth creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability\nrisks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or\nunderestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs\ndifferently.

      "abstract": "Traffic data exhibits complex temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal\ncorrelations. Most of models use either independent modules to separately\nextract temporal and spatial correlations or joint modules to synchronously\nextract them, without considering the spatial-temporal correlations. Moreover,\nmodels that consider joint spatial-temporal correlations (temporal, spatial,\nand spatial-temporal correlations) often encounter significant challenges in\naccuracy and computational efficiency which prevent such models from\ndemonstrating the expected advantages of a joint spatial-temporal correlations\narchitecture. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient pure\nconvolutional network for traffic prediction via spatial-temporal encoding and\ninferring (STEI-PCN). The model introduces and designs a dynamic adjacency\nmatrix inferring module based on absolute spatial and temporal coordinates, as\nwell as relative spatial and temporal distance encoding, using a graph\nconvolutional network combined with gating mechanism to capture local\nsynchronous joint spatial-temporal correlations. Additionally, three layers of\ntemporal dilated causal convolutional network are used to capture long-range\ntemporal correlations. Finally, through multi-view collaborative prediction\nmodule, the model integrates the gated-activated original, local synchronous\njoint spatial-temporal, and long-range temporal features to achieve\ncomprehensive prediction. This study conducts extensive experiments on flow\ndatasets (PeMS03/04/07/08) and speed dataset (PeMS-Bay), covering multiple\nprediction horizons.

However, a rigorous evaluation framework for\nvideo CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately\nassess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies\nin perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos\nspanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034\nhigh-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a\nstepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association\nwith the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven\ndistinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT\nprocess based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on\nVCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the\ntop-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7%\naccuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score\nlower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in\ntemporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust\npositive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity\nof our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning\nin solving complex video reasoning tasks.

      "abstract": "Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) aims to learn a fine-grained\nrepresentation that can be well generalized to unseen target domains when only\ntrained on the source domain data. Compared with generic domain generalization,\nFGDG is particularly challenging in that the fine-grained category can be only\ndiscerned by some subtle and tiny patterns. Such patterns are particularly\nfragile under the cross-domain style shifts caused by illumination, color and\netc. To push this frontier, this paper presents a novel Hyperbolic State Space\nHallucination (HSSH) method. It consists of two key components, namely, state\nspace hallucination (SSH) and hyperbolic manifold consistency (HMC). SSH\nenriches the style diversity for the state embeddings by firstly extrapolating\nand then hallucinating the source images. Then, the pre- and post- style\nhallucinate state embeddings are projected into the hyperbolic manifold. The\nhyperbolic state space models the high-order statistics, and allows a better\ndiscernment of the fine-grained patterns. Finally, the hyperbolic distance is\nminimized, so that the impact of style variation on fine-grained patterns can\nbe eliminated. Experiments on three FGDG benchmarks demonstrate its\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

A fundamental\nchallenge for visual domain generalization is the domain gap caused by the\ndramatic style variation whereas the image content is stable. The realm of\nselective state space, exemplified by VMamba, demonstrates its global receptive\nfield in representing the content. However, the way exploiting the\ndomain-invariant property for selective state space is rarely explored. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Flow Factorized State Space model, dubbed as\nDG-Famba, for visual domain generalization. To maintain domain consistency, we\ninnovatively map the style-augmented and the original state embeddings by flow\nfactorization. In this latent flow space, each state embedding from a certain\nstyle is specified by a latent probability path. By aligning these probability\npaths in the latent space, the state embeddings are able to represent the same\ncontent distribution regardless of the style differences.

We discuss the implications of these findings for\nincentivizing and enabling safety-critical AV data sharing, specifically,\nimplications for new approaches to (1) debating and stratifying public and\nprivate AV safety knowledge, (2) innovating data tools and data sharing\npipelines that enable easier sharing of public AV safety data and knowledge;\n(3) offsetting costs of curating safety-critical data and incentivizing data\nsharing.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents\nto solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a\nzero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning.\nThis is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside\ncorresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure\nto directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any\ngiven reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often\nsuboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the\nembedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising\nfast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a\nfew steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any\nperformance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that\nexisting BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than\nthose identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast\nadaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and\nactor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional\ntask-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance\nof its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach\nmitigates the initial \"unlearning\" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning\npre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of\nfour state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and\nlocomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over\ntheir zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing\nbaselines.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved\nperformance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, this improved accuracy comes at the\ncost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning\nsequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in\ntackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it\nembeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically\nbroken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the\nsemantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens\nit generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically\naccelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry\nout simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model\nonly to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly,\nSpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in\npreserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation\ntechniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level\nequivalence at each step. Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason\nachieves $1.4-3.0\\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving\naccuracy by $0.4-9.0\\%$. Compared to speculative decoding without SpecReason,\ntheir combination yields an additional $8.8-58.0\\%$ latency reduction.

Second, mechanisms underlying LLM\nbehaviors need to be studied for better methodological validity. Thus, we\nestablish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of\npsychopathology applicable to LLMs. To ground the theory for empirical\nanalysis, we also propose a novel mechanistic interpretability method alongside\na tailored empirical analytic framework.

In concert, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that\nnetwork-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs.\nThis suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a\nsuperficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing.

The main\nutility of PIBT is that it is a very fast and effective single-step MAPF solver\nand can return a collision-free single-step solution for hundreds of agents in\nless than a millisecond. However, the main drawback of PIBT is that it is\nextremely greedy in respect to its priorities and thus leads to poor solution\nquality. Additionally, PIBT cannot use all the planning time that might be\navailable to it and returns the first solution it finds. We thus develop\nAnytime PIBT, which quickly finds a one-step solution identically to PIBT but\nthen continuously improves the solution in an anytime manner. We prove that\nAnytime PIBT converges to the optimal solution given sufficient time. We\nexperimentally validate that Anytime PIBT can rapidly improve single-step\nsolution quality within milliseconds and even find the optimal single-step\naction. However, we interestingly find that improving the single-step solution\nquality does not have a significant effect on full-horizon solution costs.",

Existing research has highlighted both the limitations\nof LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties\nusers face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI\ninteractions through an educational experiment in which participants receive\nstructured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three\ntypes of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a\nstructured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and\nprompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users.\nUsing Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction\nanalysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring\nbehavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by\nexamining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the\noverall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper\nunderstanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured\nprompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication.

      "abstract": "Spatio-temporal traffic prediction is crucial in intelligent transportation\nsystems. The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex\nspatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data.\nTraditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static\nadjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be\noverfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when\nconsidering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance\nprediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant\nhurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study\nintroduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task\nLearning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation\nmodule that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific\ngating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the\nmodelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show\nthat our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its\neffectiveness and robustness.",

This paper introduces an innovative\napproach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained\nthrough Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the\ncomplexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to\nrefine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution\nof GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of\nthe scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic\nnature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is\ndemonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck\nscheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone\nTransformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key\ncontribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which\nshowcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce\nrobust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to\ncontainer port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to\nvarious dynamic scheduling challenges.

      "abstract": "Given the massive integration of AI technologies into our daily lives,\nAI-related concepts are being used to metaphorically compare AI systems with\nhuman behaviour and/or cognitive abilities like language acquisition.\nRightfully, the epistemic success of these metaphorical comparisons should be\ndebated. Against the backdrop of the conflicting positions of the\n'computational' and 'meat' chauvinisms, we ask: can the conceptual\nconstellation of the computational and AI be applied to the human domain and\nwhat does it mean to do so? What is one doing when the conceptual\nconstellations of AI in particular are used in this fashion? Rooted in a\nWittgensteinian view of concepts and language-use, we consider two possible\nanswers and pit them against each other: either these examples are conceptual\nmetaphors, or they are attempts at conceptual engineering. We argue that they\nare conceptual metaphors, but that (1) this position is unaware of its own\nepistemological contingency, and (2) it risks committing the ''map-territory\nfallacy''. Down at the conceptual foundations of computation, (3) it most\nimportantly is a misleading 'double metaphor' because of the metaphorical\nconnection between human psychology and computation. In response to the\nshortcomings of this projected conceptual organisation of AI onto the human\ndomain, we argue that there is a semantic catch. The perspective of the\nconceptual metaphors shows avenues for forms of conceptual engineering. If this\nmethodology's criteria are met, the fallacies and epistemic shortcomings\nrelated to the conceptual metaphor view can be bypassed. At its best, the\ncross-pollution of the human and AI conceptual domains is one that prompts us\nto reflect anew on how the boundaries of our current concepts serve us and how\nthey could be approved.",

The inability to rely\non consistent work schedules leads to burnout, work-family conflicts, and\nfinancial shocks that directly impact workers' income and assets. Unforeseen\nfluctuations in earnings pose challenges in financial planning, affecting\ndecisions on savings and spending and ultimately undermining individuals'\nlong-term financial stability and well-being.\n  This issue is particularly evident in sectors where workers experience\nfrequently changing schedules without sufficient notice, including those in the\nfood service and retail sectors, part-time and hourly workers, and individuals\nwith lower incomes. These groups are already more financially vulnerable, and\nthe unpredictable nature of their schedules exacerbates their financial\nfragility.\n  Our objective is to understand how unforeseen fluctuations in earnings\nexacerbate financial fragility by investigating the extent to which\nindividuals' financial management depends on their ability to anticipate and\nplan for the future. To address this question, we develop a simulation\nframework that models how individuals optimize utility amidst financial\nuncertainty and the imperative to avoid financial ruin. We employ online\nlearning techniques, specifically adapting workers' consumption policies based\non evolving information about their work schedules.\n  With this framework, we show both theoretically and empirically how a\nworker's capacity to anticipate schedule changes enhances their long-term\nutility. Conversely, the inability to predict future events can worsen workers'\ninstability. Moreover, our framework enables us to explore interventions to\nmitigate the problem of schedule uncertainty and evaluate their effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\na wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical\nsciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations,\nsuch as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to\naddress these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent\nefforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack\nmethods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines\nsharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the\nknowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often\ndetectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness,\nand (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking\nformal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their\neffectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose\ncoordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack\nthat introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database\nwhile embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the\ntrigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries,\nwhile maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high\neffectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a\nbilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to\ndevelop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving\na high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and\nsignificantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.",

Here, we developed and evaluated deep\nlearning architectures to predict North Atlantic-European (NAE) weather\nregimes, systematically assessing the role of remote drivers in improving S2S\nforecast skill of deep learning models. We implemented (1) a Long Short-term\nMemory (LSTM) network predicting the NAE regimes of the next six weeks based on\nprevious regimes, (2) an Index-LSTM incorporating SPV and MJO indices, and (3)\na ViT-LSTM using a Vision Transformer to directly encode stratospheric wind and\ntropical outgoing longwave radiation fields. These models are compared with\noperational hindcasts as well as other AI models. Our results show that\nleveraging teleconnection information enhances skill at longer lead times.\nNotably, the ViT-LSTM outperforms ECMWF's subseasonal hindcasts beyond week 4\nby improving Scandinavian Blocking (SB) and Atlantic Ridge (AR) predictions.\nAnalysis of high-confidence predictions reveals that NAO-, SB, and AR\nopportunity forecasts can be associated with SPV variability and MJO phase\npatterns aligning with established pathways, also indicating new patterns.\nOverall, our work demonstrates that encoding physically meaningful climate\nfields can enhance S2S prediction skill, advancing AI-driven subseasonal\nforecast.

      "abstract": "TOPSIS, a popular method for ranking alternatives is based on aggregated\ndistances to ideal and anti-ideal points. As such, it was considered to be\nessentially different from widely popular and acknowledged `utility-based\nmethods', which build rankings from weight-averaged utility values.\nNonetheless, TOPSIS has recently been shown to be a natural generalization of\nthese `utility-based methods' on the grounds that the distances it uses can be\ndecomposed into so called weight-scaled means (WM) and weight-scaled standard\ndeviations (WSD) of utilities. However, the influence that these two components\nexert on the final ranking cannot be in any way influenced in the standard\nTOPSIS. This is why, building on our previous results, in this paper we put\nforward modifications that make TOPSIS aggregations responsive to WM and WSD,\nachieving some amount of well interpretable control over how the rankings are\ninfluenced by WM and WSD. The modifications constitute a natural generalization\nof the standard TOPSIS method because, thanks to them, the generalized TOPSIS\nmay turn into the original TOPSIS or, otherwise, following the decision maker's\npreferences, may trade off WM for WSD or WSD for WM. In the latter case, TOPSIS\ngradually reduces to a regular `utility-based method'. All in all, we believe\nthat the proposed generalizations constitute an interesting practical tool for\ninfluencing the ranking by controlled application of a new form of decision\nmaker's preferences.",

      "abstract": "Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum,\nwhich is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain,\nsnow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like\nnear-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception\nin such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and\nbenchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over\nNIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently\nincorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce\nthe RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000\nsynchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across\ndiverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a\nsubset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset\nof challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging\nthrough experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation.\nOur experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework\nsignificantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches,\nparticularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We\nanticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral\nimaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.",

      "abstract": "In the domain of autonomous household robots, it is of utmost importance for\nrobots to understand human behaviors and provide appropriate services. This\nrequires the robots to possess the capability to analyze complex human\nbehaviors and predict the true intentions of humans. Traditionally, humans are\nperceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots\nshould strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if\nhumans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed \"long\nshort-term intention prediction\". This task requires robots can predict the\nlong-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short\nterm intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention.\nMeanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the\nshort-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and\nsuggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention\nmodel to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train\nthis intention model. Then we propose a two-stage method to integrate the\nintention model for robots: i) predicting human intentions of both value-based\nlong-term intentions and action-based short-term intentions; and 2) analyzing\nthe consistency between the long-term and short-term intentions. Experimental\nresults indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist\nrobots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and\nshort-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term\nand short-term intentions of humans.",

By engaging in dialogues with RL\nagents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant\nenvironment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing\nframeworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual\ntask descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving\nthe ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code\nreconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table,\nwhich tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states,\novercoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and\nfacilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile\nuser-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using\nstructured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives.\nComprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness\nand stability of the proposed framework.

This\nform of data is complex to handle due to the diversity of its structures: the\nnumber and types of the columns may vary wildly from one table to another. We\ntackle the tough problem of detecting synthetic tabular data ''in the wild'',\ni.e. when the model is deployed on table structures it has never seen before.\nWe introduce a novel datum-wise transformer architecture and show that it\noutperforms existing models. Furthermore, we investigate the application of\ndomain adaptation techniques to enhance the effectiveness of our model, thereby\nproviding a more robust data-forgery detection solution.",

This effect led to a large\nbody of research focused on mining such subspaces, known as subspace selection.\nHowever, as the precise nature of the MV effect was not well understood,\ntraditional methods had to rely on heuristic-driven search schemes that\nstruggle to accurately capture the true structure of the data. Properly\nidentifying these subspaces is critical for unsupervised tasks such as outlier\ndetection or clustering, where misrepresenting the underlying data structure\ncan hinder the performance. We introduce Myopic Subspace Theory (MST), a new\ntheoretical framework that mathematically formulates the Multiple Views effect\nand writes subspace selection as a stochastic optimization problem. Based on\nMST, we introduce V-GAN, a generative method trained to solve such an\noptimization problem. This approach avoids any exhaustive search over the\nfeature space while ensuring that the intrinsic data structure is preserved.\nExperiments on 42 real-world datasets show that using V-GAN subspaces to build\nensemble methods leads to a significant increase in one-class classification\nperformance -- compared to existing subspace selection, feature selection, and\nembedding methods. Further experiments on synthetic data show that V-GAN\nidentifies subspaces more accurately while scaling better than other relevant\nsubspace selection methods.

Additionally, to enhance the multimodal instruction\nfollowing and conversational capabilities of the model, we further discuss how\nto train the chat version upon an MLLM understanding model, which is more in\nline with user habits for tasks like real-time interaction with humans.

      "abstract": "Instruction-based Image Editing (IIE) models have made significantly\nimprovement due to the progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and\ndiffusion models, which can understand and reason about complex editing\ninstructions. In addition to advancing current IIE models, accurately\nevaluating their output has become increasingly critical and challenging.\nCurrent IIE evaluation methods and their evaluation procedures often fall short\nof aligning with human judgment and often lack explainability. To address these\nlimitations, we propose JUdgement through Routing of Expertise (JURE). Each\nexpert in JURE is a pre-selected model assumed to be equipped with an atomic\nexpertise that can provide useful feedback to judge output, and the router\ndynamically routes the evaluation task of a given instruction and its output to\nappropriate experts, aggregating their feedback into a final judge. JURE is\ntrustworthy in two aspects. First, it can effortlessly provide explanations\nabout its judge by examining the routed experts and their feedback. Second,\nexperimental results demonstrate that JURE is reliable by achieving superior\nalignment with human judgments, setting a new standard for automated IIE\nevaluation. Moreover, JURE's flexible design is future-proof - modular experts\ncan be seamlessly replaced or expanded to accommodate advancements in IIE,\nmaintaining consistently high evaluation quality.

      "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR), which encodes user activity to predict the\nnext action, has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in developing commercial\npersonalized recommendation systems. Although Transformer-based models have\nproven effective for sequential recommendation, the complexity of the\nself-attention module in Transformers scales quadratically with the sequence\nlength. Controlling model complexity is essential for large-scale\nrecommendation systems, as these systems may need to handle billion-scale\nvocabularies that evolve continuously, as well as user behavior sequences that\ncan exceed tens of thousands in length. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-head latent Mamba architecture, which employs multiple low-dimensional\nMamba layers and fully connected layers coupled with positional encoding to\nsimultaneously capture historical and item information within each latent\nsubspace. Our proposed method not only enables scaling up to large-scale\nparameters but also extends to multi-domain recommendation by integrating and\nfine-tuning LLMs. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we\ndemonstrate how Hydra effectively addresses the effectiveness-efficiency\ndilemma, outperforming state-of-the-art sequential recommendation baselines\nwith significantly fewer parameters and reduced training time.",

      "abstract": "Climate science studies the structure and dynamics of Earth's climate system\nand seeks to understand how climate changes over time, where the data is\nusually stored in the format of time series, recording the climate features,\ngeolocation, time attributes, etc. Recently, much research attention has been\npaid to the climate benchmarks. In addition to the most common task of weather\nforecasting, several pioneering benchmark works are proposed for extending the\nmodality, such as domain-specific applications like tropical cyclone intensity\nprediction and flash flood damage estimation, or climate statement and\nconfidence level in the format of natural language. To further motivate the\nartificial general intelligence development for climate science, in this paper,\nwe first contribute a multi-modal climate benchmark, i.e., ClimateBench-M,\nwhich aligns (1) the time series climate data from ERA5, (2) extreme weather\nevents data from NOAA, and (3) satellite image data from NASA HLS based on a\nunified spatial-temporal granularity. Second, under each data modality, we also\npropose a simple but strong generative method that could produce competitive\nperformance in weather forecasting, thunderstorm alerts, and crop segmentation\ntasks in the proposed ClimateBench-M.

      "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by\nmapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining,\nbut can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit\nsettings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit\nQuantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery,\ndirectly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits --\nwhich we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance.\nThese weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized,\nmaintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically,\nTaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to\nestimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient\ninformation to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to\npreserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing\nmixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose\nand task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for\nboth Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the\nsame calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements\nin the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of\nLlama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25%\nabsolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over\nexisting methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the\nstrongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without\nconditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important\nweights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.",

Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks\nshow that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for\nmeasuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect\nagreement with human evaluations.

      "abstract": "The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting\nposes unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while\nLLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series\ndata with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive\naccuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods\nhave attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these\noften fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this\npaper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series\nforecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also\nenhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method\ndecomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are\nthen reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a\nmulti-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are\naligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts.\nExperiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.",

While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) show\npromise in HPO, they often struggle with effective exploitation. To address\nthis, we integrate a linear surrogate model into a genetic algorithm (GA),\nallowing for smooth integration of multiple strategies. This combination\nimproves exploitation performance, achieving an average improvement of 1.89\npercent (max 6.55 percent, min -3.45 percent) over existing HPO methods.",

      "abstract": "The cacophony of urban sounds presents a significant challenge for smart city\napplications that rely on accurate acoustic scene analysis. Effectively\nanalyzing these complex soundscapes, often characterized by overlapping sound\nsources, diverse acoustic events, and unpredictable noise levels, requires\nprecise source separation. This task becomes more complicated when only limited\ntraining data is available. This paper introduces a novel Quantum-Inspired\nGenetic Algorithm (p-QIGA) for source separation, drawing inspiration from\nquantum information theory to enhance acoustic scene analysis in smart cities.\nBy leveraging quantum superposition for efficient solution space exploration\nand entanglement to handle correlated sources, p-QIGA achieves robust\nseparation even with limited data. These quantum-inspired concepts are\nintegrated into a genetic algorithm framework to optimize source separation\nparameters. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on two datasets:\nthe TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile dataset, representing typical urban\nsoundscapes, and the Silent Cities dataset, capturing quieter urban\nenvironments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experimental results show that the\np-QIGA achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while\nexhibiting superior resilience to noise and limited training data, achieving up\nto 8.2 dB signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) in noisy environments and\noutperforming baseline methods by up to 2 dB with only 10% of the training\ndata. This research highlights the potential of p-QIGA to advance acoustic\nsignal processing in smart cities, particularly for noise pollution monitoring\nand acoustic surveillance.",

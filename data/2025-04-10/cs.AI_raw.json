    "abstract": "The advancement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly\nenhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large\nvision-language models (LVLMs). However, a rigorous evaluation framework for\nvideo CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately\nassess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies\nin perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos\nspanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034\nhigh-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a\nstepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association\nwith the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven\ndistinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT\nprocess based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on\nVCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the\ntop-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7%\naccuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score\nlower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in\ntemporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust\npositive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity\nof our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning\nin solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a\nstandardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex\nvideo reasoning task.",

    "abstract": "Cartoon avatars have been widely used in various applications, including\nsocial media, online tutoring, and gaming. However, existing cartoon avatar\ndatasets and generation methods struggle to present highly expressive avatars\nwith fine-grained facial expressions and are often inspired from real-world\nidentities, raising privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework, GenEAva, for generating high-quality cartoon avatars with\nfine-grained facial expressions. Our approach fine-tunes a state-of-the-art\ntext-to-image diffusion model to synthesize highly detailed and expressive\nfacial expressions. We then incorporate a stylization model that transforms\nthese realistic faces into cartoon avatars while preserving both identity and\nexpression. Leveraging this framework, we introduce the first expressive\ncartoon avatar dataset, GenEAva 1.0, specifically designed to capture 135\nfine-grained facial expressions, featuring 13,230 expressive cartoon avatars\nwith a balanced distribution across genders, racial groups, and age ranges. We\ndemonstrate that our fine-tuned model generates more expressive faces than the\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model SDXL. We also verify that the\ncartoon avatars generated by our framework do not include memorized identities\nfrom fine-tuning data. The proposed framework and dataset provide a diverse and\nexpressive benchmark for future research in cartoon avatar generation.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents\nto solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a\nzero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning.\nThis is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside\ncorresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure\nto directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any\ngiven reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often\nsuboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the\nembedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising\nfast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a\nfew steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any\nperformance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that\nexisting BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than\nthose identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast\nadaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and\nactor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional\ntask-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance\nof its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach\nmitigates the initial \"unlearning\" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning\npre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of\nfour state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and\nlocomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over\ntheir zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved\nperformance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using\nLarge Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, this improved accuracy comes at the\ncost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning\nsequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in\ntackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it\nembeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically\nbroken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the\nsemantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens\nit generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically\naccelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry\nout simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model\nonly to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly,\nSpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in\npreserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation\ntechniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level\nequivalence at each step. Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason\nachieves 1.5-2.5$\\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving\naccuracy by 1.0-9.9\\%.

    "abstract": "A popular approach to neurosymbolic AI is to take the output of the last\nlayer of a neural network, e.g. a softmax activation, and pass it through a\nsparse computation graph encoding certain logical constraints one wishes to\nenforce. This induces a probability distribution over a set of random\nvariables, which happen to be conditionally independent of each other in many\ncommonly used neurosymbolic AI models. Such conditionally independent random\nvariables have been deemed harmful as their presence has been observed to\nco-occur with a phenomenon dubbed deterministic bias, where systems learn to\ndeterministically prefer one of the valid solutions from the solution space\nover the others. We provide evidence contesting this conclusion and show that\nthe phenomenon of deterministic bias is an artifact of improperly applying\nneurosymbolic AI.",

    "abstract": "PIBT is a popular Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) method at the core of many\nstate-of-the-art MAPF methods including LaCAM, CS-PIBT, and WPPL. The main\nutility of PIBT is that it is a very fast and effective single-step MAPF solver\nand can return a collision-free single-step solution for hundreds of agents in\nless than a millisecond. However, the main drawback of PIBT is that it is\nextremely greedy in respect to its priorities and thus leads to poor solution\nquality. Additionally, PIBT cannot use all the planning time that might be\navailable to it and returns the first solution it finds. We thus develop\nAnytime PIBT, which quickly finds a one-step solution identically to PIBT but\nthen continuously improves the solution in an anytime manner. We prove that\nAnytime PIBT converges to the optimal solution given sufficient time. We\nexperimentally validate that Anytime PIBT can rapidly improve single-step\nsolution quality within milliseconds and even find the optimal single-step\naction. However, we interestingly find that improving the single-step solution\nquality does not have a significant effect on full-horizon solution costs.",

These\nmodels are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to\narticulate requests with minimal effort. However, despite their accessibility,\nstudies reveal that users often struggle with effective prompting, resulting in\ninefficient responses. Existing research has highlighted both the limitations\nof LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties\nusers face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI\ninteractions through an educational experiment in which participants receive\nstructured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three\ntypes of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a\nstructured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and\nprompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users.\nUsing Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction\nanalysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring\nbehavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by\nexamining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the\noverall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper\nunderstanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured\nprompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication.

In\nparticular, no publicly available data from real ID documents exists, and most\nstudies rely on proprietary in-house databases that are not available due to\nprivacy reasons. In order to shed some light on this critical challenge that\nmakes difficult to advance in the field, we explore a trade-off between privacy\n(i.e., amount of sensitive data available) and performance, proposing a novel\npatch-wise approach for privacy-preserving fake ID detection. Our proposed\napproach explores how privacy can be enhanced through: i) two levels of\nanonymization for an ID document (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii)\ndifferent patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data\nvisible in the patch image.

    "abstract": "AlphaZero in 2017 was able to master chess and other games without human\nknowledge by playing millions of games against itself (self-play), with a\ncomputation budget running in the tens of millions of dollars. It used a\nvariant of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, known as PUCT. This\npaper introduces search-contempt, a novel hybrid variant of the MCTS algorithm\nthat fundamentally alters the distribution of positions generated in self-play,\npreferring more challenging positions. In addition, search-contempt has been\nshown to give a big boost in strength for engines in Odds Chess (where one side\nreceives an unfavorable position from the start). More significantly, it opens\nup the possibility of training a self-play based engine, in a much more\ncomputationally efficient manner with the number of training games running into\nhundreds of thousands, costing tens of thousands of dollars (instead of tens of\nmillions of training games costing millions of dollars required by AlphaZero).\nThis means that it may finally be possible to train such a program from zero on\na standard consumer GPU even with a very limited compute, cost, or time budget.",

    "abstract": "Given the massive integration of AI technologies into our daily lives,\nAI-related concepts are being used to metaphorically compare AI systems with\nhuman behaviour and/or cognitive abilities like language acquisition.\nRightfully, the epistemic success of these metaphorical comparisons should be\ndebated. Against the backdrop of the conflicting positions of the\n'computational' and 'meat' chauvinisms, we ask: can the conceptual\nconstellation of the computational and AI be applied to the human domain and\nwhat does it mean to do so? What is one doing when the conceptual\nconstellations of AI in particular are used in this fashion? Rooted in a\nWittgensteinian view of concepts and language-use, we consider two possible\nanswers and pit them against each other: either these examples are conceptual\nmetaphors, or they are attempts at conceptual engineering. We argue that they\nare conceptual metaphors, but that (1) this position is unaware of its own\nepistemological contingency, and (2) it risks committing the ''map-territory\nfallacy''. Down at the conceptual foundations of computation, (3) it most\nimportantly is a misleading 'double metaphor' because of the metaphorical\nconnection between human psychology and computation. In response to the\nshortcomings of this projected conceptual organisation of AI onto the human\ndomain, we argue that there is a semantic catch. The perspective of the\nconceptual metaphors shows avenues for forms of conceptual engineering. If this\nmethodology's criteria are met, the fallacies and epistemic shortcomings\nrelated to the conceptual metaphor view can be bypassed. At its best, the\ncross-pollution of the human and AI conceptual domains is one that prompts us\nto reflect anew on how the boundaries of our current concepts serve us and how\nthey could be approved.",

The inability to rely\non consistent work schedules leads to burnout, work-family conflicts, and\nfinancial shocks that directly impact workers' income and assets. Unforeseen\nfluctuations in earnings pose challenges in financial planning, affecting\ndecisions on savings and spending and ultimately undermining individuals'\nlong-term financial stability and well-being.\n  This issue is particularly evident in sectors where workers experience\nfrequently changing schedules without sufficient notice, including those in the\nfood service and retail sectors, part-time and hourly workers, and individuals\nwith lower incomes. These groups are already more financially vulnerable, and\nthe unpredictable nature of their schedules exacerbates their financial\nfragility.\n  Our objective is to understand how unforeseen fluctuations in earnings\nexacerbate financial fragility by investigating the extent to which\nindividuals' financial management depends on their ability to anticipate and\nplan for the future. To address this question, we develop a simulation\nframework that models how individuals optimize utility amidst financial\nuncertainty and the imperative to avoid financial ruin. We employ online\nlearning techniques, specifically adapting workers' consumption policies based\non evolving information about their work schedules.\n  With this framework, we show both theoretically and empirically how a\nworker's capacity to anticipate schedule changes enhances their long-term\nutility. Conversely, the inability to predict future events can worsen workers'\ninstability. Moreover, our framework enables us to explore interventions to\nmitigate the problem of schedule uncertainty and evaluate their effectiveness.",

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations,\nsuch as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to\naddress these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent\nefforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack\nmethods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines\nsharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the\nknowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often\ndetectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness,\nand (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking\nformal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their\neffectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose\ncoordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack\nthat introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database\nwhile embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the\ntrigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries,\nwhile maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high\neffectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a\nbilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to\ndevelop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving\na high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and\nsignificantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.",

Hence, their increasing\npopularity has catalyzed further extensive research for understanding the\npotential of the duo GenAI-IoT, how they interplay, and to which extent their\nsynergy can innovate the state-of-the-art in their individual scenarios.\nHowever, despite the increasing prominence of GenAI for IoT Computing, much of\nthe existing research remains focused on specific, narrowly scoped\napplications. This fragmented approach highlights the need for a more\ncomprehensive analysis of the potential, challenges, and implications of GenAI\nintegration within the broader IoT ecosystem. This survey exactly aims to\naddress this gap by providing a holistic overview of the opportunities, issues,\nand considerations arising from the convergence of these mainstream paradigms.\nOur contribution is realized through a systematic literature review following\nthe PRISMA methodology. A comparison framework is presented, and well-defined\nresearch questions are outlined to comprehensively explore the past, present,\nand future directions of GenAI integration with IoT Computing, offering\nvaluable insights for both experts and newcomers.",

Teleconnections, such as the\nstratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), offer\nwindows of enhanced predictability, however, their complex interactions remain\nunderutilized in operational forecasting. Here, we developed and evaluated deep\nlearning architectures to predict North Atlantic-European (NAE) weather\nregimes, systematically assessing the role of remote drivers in improving S2S\nforecast skill of deep learning models. We implemented (1) a Long Short-term\nMemory (LSTM) network predicting the NAE regimes of the next six weeks based on\nprevious regimes, (2) an Index-LSTM incorporating SPV and MJO indices, and (3)\na ViT-LSTM using a Vision Transformer to directly encode stratospheric wind and\ntropical outgoing longwave radiation fields. These models are compared with\noperational hindcasts as well as other AI models. Our results show that\nleveraging teleconnection information enhances skill at longer lead times.\nNotably, the ViT-LSTM outperforms ECMWF's subseasonal hindcasts beyond week 4\nby improving Scandinavian Blocking (SB) and Atlantic Ridge (AR) predictions.\nAnalysis of high-confidence predictions reveals that NAO-, SB, and AR\nopportunity forecasts can be associated with SPV variability and MJO phase\npatterns aligning with established pathways, also indicating new patterns.\nOverall, our work demonstrates that encoding physically meaningful climate\nfields can enhance S2S prediction skill, advancing AI-driven subseasonal\nforecast.

This\nrequires the robots to possess the capability to analyze complex human\nbehaviors and predict the true intentions of humans. Traditionally, humans are\nperceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots\nshould strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if\nhumans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed \"long\nshort-term intention prediction\". This task requires robots can predict the\nlong-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short\nterm intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention.\nMeanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the\nshort-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and\nsuggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention\nmodel to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train\nthis intention model. Then we propose a two-stage method to integrate the\nintention model for robots: i) predicting human intentions of both value-based\nlong-term intentions and action-based short-term intentions; and 2) analyzing\nthe consistency between the long-term and short-term intentions. Experimental\nresults indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist\nrobots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and\nshort-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term\nand short-term intentions of humans.",

    "abstract": "Outlier detection in high-dimensional tabular data is challenging since data\nis often distributed across multiple lower-dimensional subspaces -- a\nphenomenon known as the Multiple Views effect (MV). This effect led to a large\nbody of research focused on mining such subspaces, known as subspace selection.\nHowever, as the precise nature of the MV effect was not well understood,\ntraditional methods had to rely on heuristic-driven search schemes that\nstruggle to accurately capture the true structure of the data. Properly\nidentifying these subspaces is critical for unsupervised tasks such as outlier\ndetection or clustering, where misrepresenting the underlying data structure\ncan hinder the performance. We introduce Myopic Subspace Theory (MST), a new\ntheoretical framework that mathematically formulates the Multiple Views effect\nand writes subspace selection as a stochastic optimization problem. Based on\nMST, we introduce V-GAN, a generative method trained to solve such an\noptimization problem. This approach avoids any exhaustive search over the\nfeature space while ensuring that the intrinsic data structure is preserved.\nExperiments on 42 real-world datasets show that using V-GAN subspaces to build\nensemble methods leads to a significant increase in one-class classification\nperformance -- compared to existing subspace selection, feature selection, and\nembedding methods. Further experiments on synthetic data show that V-GAN\nidentifies subspaces more accurately while scaling better than other relevant\nsubspace selection methods. These results confirm the theoretical guarantees of\nour approach and also highlight its practical viability in high-dimensional\nsettings.",

Unlike traditional emotion recognition,\nEI tasks require reasoning about triggers instead of mere labeling. To\nfacilitate EI research, we present EIBench, a large-scale benchmark\nencompassing 1,615 basic EI samples and 50 complex EI samples featuring\nmultifaceted emotions.

    "abstract": "Modern large language foundation models (LLM) have now entered the daily\nlives of millions of users. We ask a natural question whether it is possible to\ncustomize LLM for every user or every task. From system and industrial economy\nconsideration, general continue-training or fine-tuning still require\nsubstantial computation and memory of training GPU nodes, whereas most\ninference nodes under deployment, possibly with lower-end GPUs, are configured\nto make forward pass fastest possible. We propose a framework to take full\nadvantages of existing LLMs and systems of online service. We train an\nadditional branch of transformer blocks on the final-layer embedding of\npretrained LLMs, which is the base, then a carry-on module merge the base\nmodels to compose a customized LLM. We can mix multiple layers, or multiple\nLLMs specialized in different domains such as chat, coding, math, to form a new\nmixture of LLM that best fit a new task. As the base model don't need to update\nparameters, we are able to outsource most computation of the training job on\ninference nodes, and only train a lightweight carry-on on training nodes, where\nwe consume less than 1GB GPU memory to train a 100M carry-on layer on 30B LLM.\nWe tested Qwen and DeepSeek opensourced models for continue-pretraining and got\nfaster loss convergence. We use it to improve solving math questions with\nextremely small computation and model size, with 1000 data samples of\nchain-of-thoughts, and as small as 1 MB parameters of two layer layer carry-on,\nand the results are promising.",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR), which encodes user activity to predict the\nnext action, has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in developing commercial\npersonalized recommendation systems. Although Transformer-based models have\nproven effective for sequential recommendation, the complexity of the\nself-attention module in Transformers scales quadratically with the sequence\nlength. Controlling model complexity is essential for large-scale\nrecommendation systems, as these systems may need to handle billion-scale\nvocabularies that evolve continuously, as well as user behavior sequences that\ncan exceed tens of thousands in length. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-head latent Mamba architecture, which employs multiple low-dimensional\nMamba layers and fully connected layers coupled with positional encoding to\nsimultaneously capture historical and item information within each latent\nsubspace. Our proposed method not only enables scaling up to large-scale\nparameters but also extends to multi-domain recommendation by integrating and\nfine-tuning LLMs. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we\ndemonstrate how Hydra effectively addresses the effectiveness-efficiency\ndilemma, outperforming state-of-the-art sequential recommendation baselines\nwith significantly fewer parameters and reduced training time.",

We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit\nQuantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery,\ndirectly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits --\nwhich we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance.\nThese weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized,\nmaintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically,\nTaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to\nestimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient\ninformation to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to\npreserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing\nmixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose\nand task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for\nboth Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the\nsame calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements\nin the 2 and 3-bit regime.

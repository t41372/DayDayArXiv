    "abstract": "Link prediction for directed graphs is a crucial task with diverse real-world\napplications. Recent advances in embedding methods and Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have shown promising improvements. However, these methods often lack a\nthorough analysis of their expressiveness and suffer from effective benchmarks\nfor a fair evaluation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to assess\nthe expressiveness of existing methods, highlighting the impact of dual\nembeddings and decoder design on directed link prediction performance. To\naddress limitations in current benchmark setups, we introduce DirLinkBench, a\nrobust new benchmark with comprehensive coverage, standardized evaluation, and\nmodular extensibility. The results on DirLinkBench show that current methods\nstruggle to achieve strong performance, while DiGAE outperforms other baselines\noverall. We further revisit DiGAE theoretically, showing its graph convolution\naligns with GCN on an undirected bipartite graph. Inspired by these insights,\nwe propose a novel Spectral Directed Graph Auto-Encoder SDGAE that achieves\nstate-of-the-art average performance on DirLinkBench. Finally, we analyze key\nfactors influencing directed link prediction and highlight open challenges in\nthis field.",

This extension allows EHBOS to identify\ncontextual and dependency-driven anomalies that HBOS fails to detect.

EHBOS outperforms HBOS\non several datasets, particularly those where feature interactions are critical\nin defining the anomaly structure, achieving notable improvements in ROC AUC.\nThese results highlight that EHBOS can be a valuable extension to HBOS, with\nthe ability to model complex feature dependencies.

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel algorithm for progressively adapting neural\nnetwork architecture along the depth. In particular, we attempt to address the\nfollowing questions in a mathematically principled way: i) Where to add a new\ncapacity (layer) during the training process? ii) How to initialize the new\ncapacity? At the heart of our approach are two key ingredients: i) the\nintroduction of a ``shape functional\" to be minimized, which depends on neural\nnetwork topology, and ii) the introduction of a topological derivative of the\nshape functional with respect to the neural network topology. Using an optimal\ncontrol viewpoint, we show that the network topological derivative exists under\ncertain conditions, and its closed-form expression is derived. In particular,\nwe explore, for the first time, the connection between the topological\nderivative from a topology optimization framework with the Hamiltonian from\noptimal control theory. Further, we show that the optimality condition for the\nshape functional leads to an eigenvalue problem for deep neural architecture\nadaptation. Our approach thus determines the most sensitive location along the\ndepth where a new layer needs to be inserted during the training phase and the\nassociated parametric initialization for the newly added layer. We also\ndemonstrate that our layer insertion strategy can be derived from an optimal\ntransport viewpoint as a solution to maximizing a topological derivative in\n$p$-Wasserstein space, where $p>= 1$. Numerical investigations with fully\nconnected network, convolutional neural network, and vision transformer on\nvarious regression and classification problems demonstrate that our proposed\napproach can outperform an ad-hoc baseline network and other architecture\nadaptation strategies. Further, we also demonstrate other applications of\ntopological derivative in fields such as transfer learning.",

This is especially vital for\nlife-threatening conditions such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a\nchronic, progressive lung disease with a prognosis comparable to many cancers.\nComputed tomography (CT) imaging has been established as a reliable diagnostic\ntool for IPF. Accurately predicting future CT scans of early-stage IPF patients\ncan aid in developing better treatment strategies, thereby improving survival\noutcomes. In this paper, we propose 4D Vector Quantised Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (4D-VQ-GAN), a model capable of generating realistic CT volumes of IPF\npatients at any time point. The model is trained using a two-stage approach. In\nthe first stage, a 3D-VQ-GAN is trained to reconstruct CT volumes. In the\nsecond stage, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based temporal\nmodel is trained to capture the temporal dynamics of the quantised embeddings\ngenerated by the encoder in the first stage. We evaluate different\nconfigurations of our model for generating longitudinal CT scans and compare\nthe results against ground truth data, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nFor validation, we conduct survival analysis using imaging biomarkers derived\nfrom generated CT scans and achieve a C-index comparable to that of biomarkers\nderived from the real CT scans.

Yet traditional similarity methods based on cosine similarity\nbetween word embeddings cannot capture the context-dependent, asymmetrical,\npolysemous nature of semantic similarity. We propose a new measure of\nsimilarity, Word Confusion, that reframes semantic similarity in terms of\nfeature-based classification confusion. Word Confusion is inspired by Tversky's\nsuggestion that similarity features be chosen dynamically. Here we train a\nclassifier to map contextual embeddings to word identities and use the\nclassifier confusion (the probability of choosing a confounding word c instead\nof the correct target word t) as a measure of the similarity of c and t. The\nset of potential confounding words acts as the chosen features. Our method is\ncomparable to cosine similarity in matching human similarity judgments across\nseveral datasets (MEN, WirdSim353, and SimLex), and can measure similarity\nusing predetermined features of interest. We demonstrate our model's ability to\nmake use of dynamic features by applying it to test a hypothesis about changes\nin the 18th C. meaning of the French word \"revolution\" from popular to state\naction during the French Revolution. We hope this reimagining of semantic\nsimilarity will inspire the development of new tools that better capture the\nmulti-faceted and dynamic nature of language, advancing the fields of\ncomputational social science and cultural analytics and beyond.",

Forecasting for both short and long\ntime series was evaluated. Our findings indicate that no single prompting\nmethod is universally applicable. It was also observed that simply providing\nproper context information related to the time series, without additional\nreasoning prompts, can achieve performance comparable to the best-performing\nprompt for each case. From this observation, it is expected that providing\nproper context information can be more crucial than a prompt for specific\nreasoning in time series forecasting. Several weaknesses in prompting for time\nseries forecasting were also identified. First, LLMs often fail to follow the\nprocedures described by the prompt. Second, when reasoning steps involve simple\nalgebraic calculations with several operands, LLMs often fail to calculate\naccurately.

    "abstract": "This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of\nEpisodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised\nLearning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed\ncompetitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their\ntheoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This\nwork initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad\nparadigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or\nsequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of\nconditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can\nidentify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain\nstable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise.\nSpecifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of\ncommand-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending\non the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We\ndemonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is\nlocated in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The\nmentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at\ndeterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of\nlearning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit\nestimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of\nthe underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a\nnumber of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment\nspaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the\nfixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied\nby a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "Though English sentences are typically inflexible vis-\\`a-vis word order,\nconstituents often show far more variability in ordering. One prominent theory\npresents the notion that constituent ordering is directly correlated with\nconstituent weight: a measure of the constituent's length or complexity. Such\ntheories are interesting in the context of natural language processing (NLP),\nbecause while recent advances in NLP have led to significant gains in the\nperformance of large language models (LLMs), much remains unclear about how\nthese models process language, and how this compares to human language\nprocessing. In particular, the question remains whether LLMs display the same\npatterns with constituent movement, and may provide insights into existing\ntheories on when and how the shift occurs in human language. We compare a\nvariety of LLMs with diverse properties to evaluate broad LLM performance on\nfour types of constituent movement: heavy NP shift, particle movement, dative\nalternation, and multiple PPs. Despite performing unexpectedly around particle\nmovement, LLMs generally align with human preferences around constituent\nordering.",

Current approaches employ external tool-based iterative\ndebuggers that use compiler or other tool-based runtime feedback to refine\ncoarse programs generated by various methods.

In this paper, we introduce CodeSim, a novel\nmulti-agent code generation framework that comprehensively addresses the stages\nof program synthesis-planning, coding, and debugging-through a human-like\nperception approach. As human verifies their understanding of any algorithms\nthrough visual simulation, CodeSim uniquely features a method of plan\nverification and internal debugging through the step-by-step simulation of\ninput/output. Extensive experiments across seven challenging competitive\nproblem-solving and program synthesis benchmarks demonstrate CodeSim's\nremarkable code generation capabilities. Our framework achieves new\nstate-of-the-art (pass@1) results-(HumanEval 95.1%, MBPP 90.7%, APPS 22%, and\nCodeContests 29.1%). Furthermore, our method shows potential for even greater\nenhancement when cascaded with external debuggers.

Most previous methods in Action-Constrained Reinforcement\nLearning (ACRL) employ a projection layer after the policy network to correct\nthe action.

However, generative models require training using samples from the\nconstrained action space, which itself is challenging. To address such\nlimitations, first, we define a target distribution for feasible actions based\non constraint violation signals, and train normalizing flows by minimizing the\nKL divergence between an approximated distribution over feasible actions and\nthe target. This eliminates the need to generate feasible action samples,\ngreatly simplifying the flow model learning. Second, we integrate the learned\nflow model with existing deep RL methods, which restrict it to exploring only\nthe feasible action space. Third, we extend our approach beyond ACRL to handle\nstate-wise constraints by learning the constraint violation signal from the\nenvironment.

To tackle these challenges, researchers have separately\ndevised secure aggregation mechanisms to protect data privacy and robust\naggregation methods that withstand poisoning attacks. However, simultaneously\naddressing both concerns is challenging; secure aggregation facilitates\npoisoning attacks as most anomaly detection techniques require access to\nunencrypted local model updates, which are obscured by secure aggregation. Few\nrecent efforts to simultaneously tackle both challenges offen depend on\nimpractical assumption of non-colluding two-server setups that disrupt FL's\ntopology, or three-party computation which introduces scalability issues,\ncomplicating deployment and application. To overcome this dilemma, this paper\nintroduce a Dual Defense Federated learning (DDFed) framework. DDFed\nsimultaneously boosts privacy protection and mitigates poisoning attacks,\nwithout introducing new participant roles or disrupting the existing FL\ntopology. DDFed initially leverages cutting-edge fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE) to securely aggregate model updates, without the impractical requirement\nfor non-colluding two-server setups and ensures strong privacy protection.\nAdditionally, we proposes a unique two-phase anomaly detection mechanism for\nencrypted model updates, featuring secure similarity computation and\nfeedback-driven collaborative selection, with additional measures to prevent\npotential privacy breaches from Byzantine clients incorporated into the\ndetection process. We conducted extensive experiments on various model\npoisoning attacks and FL scenarios, including both cross-device and cross-silo\nFL.

Nonetheless, existing works mostly focus on one-shot\ndeterministic CO, while sequential stochastic CO (SSCO) has rarely been studied\ndespite its broad applications such as adaptive influence maximization (IM) and\ninfectious disease intervention. In this paper, we study the SSCO problem where\nwe first decide the budget (e.g., number of seed nodes in adaptive IM)\nallocation for all time steps, and then select a set of nodes for each time\nstep. The few existing studies on SSCO simplify the problems by assuming a\nuniformly distributed budget allocation over the time horizon, yielding\nsuboptimal solutions.

WS-option starts with a coherent formulation of\nthe two-layer Markov decision processes (MDPs), capturing the interdependencies\nbetween the two layers of decisions. Building on this, WS-option employs\nseveral innovative designs to balance the model's training stability and\ncomputational efficiency, preventing the vicious cyclic interference issue\nbetween the two layers.

Existing methods heavily depend on the manual annotation of\nhigh-quality positive samples, while contending with issues such as noisy\nlabels and minimal distinctions between preferred and dispreferred response\ndata. However, readily available toxic samples with clear safety distinctions\nare often filtered out, removing valuable negative references that could aid\nLLMs in safety alignment. In response, we propose PT-ALIGN, a novel safety\nself-alignment approach that minimizes human supervision by automatically\nrefining positive and toxic samples and performing fine-grained dual\ninstruction tuning. Positive samples are harmless responses, while toxic\nsamples deliberately contain extremely harmful content, serving as a new\nsupervisory signals. Specifically, we utilize LLM itself to iteratively\ngenerate and refine training instances by only exploring fewer than 50 human\nannotations. We then employ two losses, i.e., maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) and fine-grained unlikelihood training (UT), to jointly learn to enhance\nthe LLM's safety. The MLE loss encourages an LLM to maximize the generation of\nharmless content based on positive samples. Conversely, the fine-grained UT\nloss guides the LLM to minimize the output of harmful words based on negative\nsamples at the token-level, thereby guiding the model to decouple safety from\neffectiveness, directing it toward safer fine-tuning objectives, and increasing\nthe likelihood of generating helpful and reliable content.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models primarily operate through text-based inputs and\noutputs, yet human emotion is communicated through both verbal and non-verbal\ncues, including facial expressions. While Vision-Language Models analyze facial\nexpressions from images, they are resource-intensive and may depend more on\nlinguistic priors than visual understanding. To address this, this study\ninvestigates whether LLMs can infer affective meaning from dimensions of facial\nexpressions-Valence and Arousal values, structured numerical representations,\nrather than using raw visual input. VA values were extracted using Facechannel\nfrom images of facial expressions and provided to LLMs in two tasks: (1)\ncategorizing facial expressions into basic (on the IIMI dataset) and complex\nemotions (on the Emotic dataset) and (2) generating semantic descriptions of\nfacial expressions (on the Emotic dataset). Results from the categorization\ntask indicate that LLMs struggle to classify VA values into discrete emotion\ncategories, particularly for emotions beyond basic polarities (e.g., happiness,\nsadness). However, in the semantic description task, LLMs produced textual\ndescriptions that align closely with human-generated interpretations,\ndemonstrating a stronger capacity for free text affective inference of facial\nexpressions.",

Inspired by human protocols that combine visual\nidentification with acoustic verification, this study proposes a deep\nlearning-based robotic system for autonomously detecting and classifying gas\nleaks and arc discharges in manufacturing settings. The system is designed to\nexecute all experimental tasks entirely onboard the robot. Utilizing a\n112-channel acoustic camera operating at a 96 kHz sampling rate to capture\nultrasonic frequencies, the system processes real-world datasets recorded in\ndiverse industrial scenarios. These datasets include multiple gas leak\nconfigurations (e.g., pinhole, open end) and partial discharge types (Corona,\nSurface, Floating) under varying environmental noise conditions. Proposed\nsystem integrates visual detection and a beamforming-enhanced acoustic analysis\npipeline. Signals are transformed using STFT and refined through Gamma\nCorrection, enabling robust feature extraction. An Inception-inspired CNN\nfurther classifies hazards, achieving 99% gas leak detection accuracy. The\nsystem not only detects individual hazard sources but also enhances\nclassification reliability by fusing multi-modal data from both vision and\nacoustic sensors. When tested in reverberation and noise-augmented\nenvironments, the system outperformed conventional models by up to 44%p, with\nexperimental tasks meticulously designed to ensure fairness and\nreproducibility. Additionally, the system is optimized for real-time\ndeployment, maintaining an inference time of 2.1 seconds on a mobile robotic\nplatform.

    "abstract": "Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to\ncomplex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization\nhave yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of\nrobotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot\noperation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as\naction-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we\nposit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more\neffective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that\ndirectly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In\nparticular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level\nVLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot\nend-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The\nintermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level,\n3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates\nthe high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the\nlow-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with\nthe hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant\ndomain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing\nscenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances\nand task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average\nof 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of\ngeneralization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

    "abstract": "White blood cells (WBC) are important parts of our immune system, and they\nprotect our body against infections by eliminating viruses, bacteria, parasites\nand fungi. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide\nimportant information about our health status. A traditional method,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can classify\nthe blood cell from a part of an object and perform object recognition. Various\nCNN models exhibit potential; however, their development often involves ad-hoc\nprocesses that neglect unnecessary layers, leading to issues with unbalanced\ndatasets and insufficient data augmentation. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel ensemble approach that integrates three CNN architectures, each\nuniquely configured with different dropout and max-pooling layer settings to\nenhance feature learning. This ensemble model, named DCENWCNet, effectively\nbalances the bias-variance trade-off. When evaluated on the widely recognized\nRabbin-WBC dataset, our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art networks,\nachieving highest mean accuracy. Additionally, it demonstrates superior\nperformance in precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)\nacross all categories. To delve deeper into the interpretability of\nclassifiers, we employ reliable post-hoc explanation techniques, including\nLocal Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). These methods\napproximate the behavior of a black-box model by elucidating the relationships\nbetween feature values and predictions. Interpretable results enable users to\ncomprehend and validate the model's predictions, thereby increasing their\nconfidence in the automated diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Developing intelligent agents for long-term cooperation in dynamic open-world\nscenarios is a major challenge in multi-agent systems. Traditional Multi-agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks like centralized training\ndecentralized execution (CTDE) struggle with scalability and flexibility. They\nrequire centralized long-term planning, which is difficult without custom\nreward functions, and face challenges in processing multi-modal data. CTDE\napproaches also assume fixed cooperation strategies, making them impractical in\ndynamic environments where agents need to adapt and plan independently. To\naddress decentralized multi-agent cooperation, we propose Decentralized\nAdaptive Knowledge Graph Memory and Structured Communication System (DAMCS) in\na novel Multi-agent Crafter environment. Our generative agents, powered by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), are more scalable than traditional MARL agents by\nleveraging external knowledge and language for long-term planning and\nreasoning. Instead of fully sharing information from all past experiences,\nDAMCS introduces a multi-modal memory system organized as a hierarchical\nknowledge graph and a structured communication protocol to optimize agent\ncooperation. This allows agents to reason from past interactions and share\nrelevant information efficiently. Experiments on novel multi-agent open-world\ntasks show that DAMCS outperforms both MARL and LLM baselines in task\nefficiency and collaboration. Compared to single-agent scenarios, the two-agent\nscenario achieves the same goal with 63% fewer steps, and the six-agent\nscenario with 74% fewer steps, highlighting the importance of adaptive memory\nand structured communication in achieving long-term goals.

This raises an important\nquestion: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source\ndomains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs\nfrom different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies\nleverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual\ndescriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to\ntext-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to\nalign different feature distributions across domains, while generally\nneglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure\nAlignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and\ncross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT).

Specifically, we\nintroduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation\nacross source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain\nadaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific\nprompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and\nfine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain.\nFinally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to\nevaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.",

    "abstract": "Consistency models (CMs) have shown promise in the efficient generation of\nboth image and text. This raises the natural question of whether we can learn a\nunified CM for efficient multimodal generation (e.g., text-to-image) and\nunderstanding (e.g., image-to-text). Intuitively, such a model could be\nacquired by applying the consistency distillation (CD) to existing unified\nmultimodal models. However, the key challenge is establishing a unified\ndenoising perspective for both image and text generation, which is essential\nfor establishing the consistency mapping. To tackle this, at the representation\nlevel, we advocate for discrete tokens for both modalities to best preserve\nlanguage modeling capabilities. Critically, instead of defining the text\ndenoising trajectory via recent discrete diffusion language modeling\nprinciples, we specify it using the parallel decoding trace of an\nautoregressive language model, benefiting from the latter's superior\nperformance in general text generation tasks. The denoising trajectory of image\ntokens adheres to standard discrete diffusion. We train our unified consistency\nmodels (UniCMs) on these combined multimodal trajectories simultaneously with a\nunified objective. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy to further\nimprove the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation,\nUniCMs outperform SD3 on GenEval, Image Reward, and CLIP Score metrics, while\nrequiring only approximately ${1}/{8}$ of the sampling time. Meanwhile, in\nimage-to-text generation, UniCMs surpass Show-o on the MMMU benchmark while\nbeing $1.5 \\times$ faster at long-sequence generating speed.

    "abstract": "The drastic changes in the global economy, geopolitical conditions, and\ndisruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the cost of living and\nquality of life. It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost\nof living and quality of life in major economies. A transparent and\ncomprehensive living index must include multiple dimensions of living\nconditions. In this study, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of\nlife through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various\nsocio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our\nindex utilises economic indicators that define living standards, which could\nhelp in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine\nlearning framework for addressing the problem of missing data for some of the\neconomic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update the data\nand use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to\ncreate the Ease of Living Index for major economies since 1970. Our work\nsignificantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for\npolicymakers to identify areas needing improvement, such as healthcare systems,\nemployment opportunities, and public safety. Our approach with open data and\ncode can be easily reproduced and applied to various contexts.

Recently,\na deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully\ntrained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research\nvessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However,\nvalidating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses\nsignificant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and\nthe associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a\nphoto-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in\nGaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling\nimage pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and\nhigh-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the\ncreation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images\ncollected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of\nflight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and\nthe deep monocular pose estimation scheme. This approach provides a\ncost-effective solution for testing and validating the autonomous flight of\nshipboard UAVs, specifically focusing on vision-based control and estimation\nalgorithms.",

Many\nrecently proposed style transfer methods have a common problem; that is, they\nsimply transfer the texture and color of the style image to the global\nstructure of the content image. As a result, the content image has a local\nstructure that is not similar to the local structure of the style image. In\nthis paper, we present an effective method that can be used to transfer style\npatterns while fusing the local style structure into the local content\nstructure. In our method, dif-ferent levels of coarse stylized features are\nfirst reconstructed at low resolution using a Coarse Network, in which style\ncolor distribution is roughly transferred, and the content structure is\ncombined with the style structure. Then, the reconstructed features and the\ncontent features are adopted to synthesize high-quality structure-aware\nstylized images with high resolution using a Fine Network with three structural\nselective fusion (SSF) modules. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated\nthrough the generation of appealing high-quality stylization results and a\ncom-parison with some state-of-the-art style transfer methods.",

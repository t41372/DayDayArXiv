    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) have brought numerous of new applications to\nMachine Learning (ML). In the context of tabular data (TD), recent studies show\nthat TabLLM is a very powerful mechanism for few-shot-learning (FSL)\napplications, even if gradient boosting decisions trees (GBDT) have\nhistorically dominated the TD field. In this work we demonstrate that although\nLLMs are a viable alternative, the evidence suggests that baselines used to\ngauge performance can be improved. We replicated public benchmarks and our\nmethodology improves LightGBM by 290%, this is mainly driven by forcing node\nsplitting with few samples, a critical step in FSL with GBDT. Our results show\nan advantage to TabLLM for 8 or fewer shots, but as the number of samples\nincreases GBDT provides competitive performance at a fraction of runtime. For\nother real-life applications with vast number of samples, we found FSL still\nuseful to improve model diversity, and when combined with ExtraTrees it\nprovides strong resilience to overfitting, our proposal was validated in a ML\ncompetition setting ranking first place.",

    "abstract": "Short video platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok, are used by\nbillions of users globally. These platforms expose users to harmful content,\nranging from clickbait or physical harms to misinformation or online hate. Yet,\ndetecting harmful videos remains challenging due to an inconsistent\nunderstanding of what constitutes harm and limited resources and mental tolls\ninvolved in human annotation. As such, this study advances measures and methods\nto detect harm in video content. First, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy for\nonline harm on video platforms, categorizing it into six categories:\nInformation, Hate and harassment, Addictive, Clickbait, Sexual, and Physical\nharms. Next, we establish multimodal large language models as reliable\nannotators of harmful videos. We analyze 19,422 YouTube videos using 14 image\nframes, 1 thumbnail, and text metadata, comparing the accuracy of crowdworkers\n(Mturk) and GPT-4-Turbo with domain expert annotations serving as the gold\nstandard. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4-Turbo outperforms crowdworkers in\nboth binary classification (harmful vs. harmless) and multi-label harm\ncategorization tasks. Methodologically, this study extends the application of\nLLMs to multi-label and multi-modal contexts beyond text annotation and binary\nclassification. Practically, our study contributes to online harm mitigation by\nguiding the definitions and identification of harmful content on video\nplatforms.",

This study seeks to address these challenges by developing a multilingual\nlexicon designed for French and Tshiluba, now expanded to include translations\nin English, Afrikaans, Sepedi, and Zulu. The lexicon enhances cultural\nrelevance in sentiment classification by integrating language-specific\nsentiment scores. A comprehensive testing corpus is created to support\ntranslation and sentiment analysis tasks, with machine learning models such as\nRandom Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and Gaussian Naive\nBayes (GNB) trained to predict sentiment across low resource languages (LRLs).\nAmong them, the Random Forest model performed particularly well, capturing\nsentiment polarity and handling language-specific nuances effectively.\nFurthermore, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a\nLarge Language Model (LLM), is applied to predict context-based sentiment with\nhigh accuracy, achieving 99% accuracy and 98% precision, outperforming other\nmodels. The BERT predictions were clarified using Explainable AI (XAI),\nimproving transparency and fostering confidence in sentiment classification.\nOverall, findings demonstrate that the proposed lexicon and machine learning\nmodels significantly enhance translation and sentiment analysis for LRLs in\nSouth Africa and the DRC, laying a foundation for future AI models that support\nunderrepresented languages, with applications across education, governance, and\nbusiness in multilingual contexts.",

While\nprompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can improve LLM reasoning at\ninference time, optimizing reasoning capabilities during training remains\nchallenging. We introduce LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a principled\nframework that formulates reasoning as sampling from a latent distribution and\noptimizes it via variational approaches. LaTRO enables LLMs to concurrently\nimprove both their reasoning process and ability to evaluate reasoning quality,\nwithout requiring external feedback or reward models. We validate LaTRO through\nexperiments on GSM8K and ARC-Challenge datasets using multiple model\narchitectures. On GSM8K, LaTRO improves zero-shot accuracy by an average of\n12.5% over base models and 9.6% over supervised fine-tuning across\nPhi-3.5-mini, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B. Our findings suggest that\npre-trained LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked and\nenhanced through our proposed optimization approach in a self-improvement\nmanner.

Seven open-source methods\ncovering all categories are selected, trained on MIMIC-III, and evaluated on\nMIMIC-III or MIMIC-IV for transportability considerations. Among them,\nGAN-based methods demonstrate competitive performance in fidelity and utility\non MIMIC-III; rule-based methods excel in privacy protection.

While much of the existing\nresearch focuses on racing in obstacle-free environments, few studies have\naddressed the complexities of obstacle-aware racing, and approaches presented\nin these studies often suffer from overfitting, with learned policies\ngeneralizing poorly to new environments. This work addresses the challenge of\ndeveloping a generalizable obstacle-aware drone racing policy using deep\nreinforcement learning. We propose applying domain randomization on racing\ntracks and obstacle configurations before every rollout, combined with parallel\nexperience collection in randomized environments to achieve the goal.

By combining\nnetwork psychometrics and psycholinguistic dimensions, this study identifies\nseveral similarities and distinctions between human and LLM data. The\npsychometric networks of simulated male professors do not differ between\nphysical and emotional anxiety subscales, unlike humans. Other LLMs'\npersonification can reconstruct human DASS factors with a purity up to 80%.\nFurthemore, LLM-generated personifications across different scenarios are found\nto elicit explanations lower in concreteness and imageability in items coding\nfor anxiety, in agreement with past studies about human psychology. Our\nfindings indicate an advanced yet incomplete ability for LLMs to reproduce the\ncomplexity of human psychometric data, unveiling convenient advantages and\nlimitations in using LLMs to replace human participants. PhDGPT also\nintriguingly capture the ability for LLMs to adapt and change language patterns\naccording to prompted mental distress contextual features, opening new\nquantitative opportunities for assessing the machine psychology of these\nartificial intelligences.",

This structured approach allows physicians to locate relevant\ninformation quickly, increasing the report's utility. We utilize Large Language\nModels (LLMs) such as Mixtral, Mistral, and Llama to generate concise,\nwell-structured reports. Among these, we primarily focus on the Mixtral model\ndue to its superior adherence to specific formatting requirements compared to\nother models. To maintain data security and privacy, we run these LLMs locally\nbehind our institution's firewall. We leverage the LangChain framework and\napply five distinct prompting strategies to enforce a consistent structure in\nradiology reports, aiming to eliminate extraneous language and achieve a high\nlevel of conciseness. We also introduce a novel metric, the Conciseness\nPercentage (CP) score, to evaluate report brevity. Our dataset comprises 814\nradiology reports authored by seven board-certified body radiologists at our\ncancer center. In evaluating the different prompting methods, we discovered\nthat the most effective approach for generating concise, well-structured\nreports involves first instructing the LLM to condense the report, followed by\na prompt to structure the content according to specific guidelines. We assessed\nall prompting strategies based on their ability to handle formatting issues,\nreduce report length, and adhere to formatting instructions.

These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive\npretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as\nanswering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven\npublic \"medical\" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models,\narriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical\nLLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot\nprompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance,\nacross the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical\nLLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical)\ntie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in\nthe remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each\nmedical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii)\noptimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for\nstatistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not\nconsistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they\nsubstantially impact conclusions.

We evaluate RaVL on 654 VLMs with\nvarious model architectures, data domains, and learned spurious correlations.\nOur results show that RaVL accurately discovers (191% improvement over the\nclosest baseline) and mitigates (8.2% improvement on worst-group image\nclassification accuracy) spurious correlations.

    "abstract": "Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and\nmachine learning models. However, these systems often rely on data where\nsignificant disagreement occurs during moderation, reflecting the subjective\nnature of toxicity perception. Rather than dismissing this disagreement as\nnoise, we interpret it as a valuable signal that highlights the inherent\nambiguity of the content,an insight missed when only the majority label is\nconsidered. In this work, we introduce a novel content moderation framework\nthat emphasizes the importance of capturing annotation disagreement. Our\napproach uses multitask learning, where toxicity classification serves as the\nprimary task and annotation disagreement is addressed as an auxiliary task.\nAdditionally, we leverage uncertainty estimation techniques, specifically\nConformal Prediction, to account for both the ambiguity in comment annotations\nand the model's inherent uncertainty in predicting toxicity and\ndisagreement.The framework also allows moderators to adjust thresholds for\nannotation disagreement, offering flexibility in determining when ambiguity\nshould trigger a review.

    "abstract": "Answering multi-hop reasoning questions requires retrieving and synthesizing\ninformation from diverse sources. Language models (LMs) struggle to perform\nsuch reasoning consistently. We propose an approach to pinpoint and rectify\nmulti-hop reasoning failures through targeted memory injections on LM attention\nheads. First, we analyze the per-layer activations of GPT-2 models in response\nto single- and multi-hop prompts. We then propose a mechanism that allows users\nto inject relevant prompt-specific information, which we refer to as\n\"memories,\" at critical LM locations during inference. By thus enabling the LM\nto incorporate additional relevant information during inference, we enhance the\nquality of multi-hop prompt completions. We empirically show that a simple,\nefficient, and targeted memory injection into a key attention layer often\nincreases the probability of the desired next token in multi-hop tasks, by up\nto 424%. We observe that small subsets of attention heads can significantly\nimpact the model prediction during multi-hop reasoning. To more faithfully\ninterpret these heads, we develop Attention Lens: an open source tool that\ntranslates the outputs of attention heads into vocabulary tokens via learned\ntransformations called lenses. We demonstrate the use of lenses to reveal how a\nmodel arrives at its answer and use them to localize sources of model failures\nsuch as in the case of biased and malicious language generation.",

The latter is trained in a\ndistributed manner by a group of vehicles (or clients), with local training\ndatasets consisting of vehicular location and velocity measurements, through a\nglobal server aggregation operation. The FedKalmanNet is then used by each\nvehicle to localize itself, by estimating the associated system uncertainty\nmatrices (i.e, Kalman gain).

This\ncomplicates maintaining the electrical grid balance, prompting some\ntransmission system operators in Western Europe to implement imbalance tariffs\nthat penalize unsustainable power deviations. These tariffs create an implicit\ndemand response framework to mitigate grid instability. Yet, several challenges\nlimit active participation. In Belgium, for example, imbalance prices are only\ncalculated at the end of each 15-minute settlement period, creating high risk\ndue to price uncertainty. This risk is further amplified by the inherent\nvolatility of imbalance prices, discouraging participation. Although\ntransmission system operators provide minute-based price predictions, the\nsystem imbalance volatility makes accurate price predictions challenging to\nobtain and requires sophisticated techniques. Moreover, publishing price\nestimates can prompt participants to adjust their schedules, potentially\naffecting the system balance and the final price, adding further complexity. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search method that\npublishes accurate imbalance prices while accounting for potential response\nactions. Our approach models the system dynamics using a neural network\nforecaster and a cluster of virtual batteries controlled by reinforcement\nlearning agents. Compared to Belgium's current publication method, our\ntechnique improves price accuracy by 20.4% under ideal conditions and by 12.8%\nin more realistic scenarios.

To bridge these gaps, we propose LEGO-GraphRAG, a modular framework\nthat enables: 1) fine-grained decomposition of the GraphRAG workflow, 2)\nsystematic classification of existing techniques and implemented GraphRAG\ninstances, and 3) creation of new GraphRAG instances.

However, there are debates on the\ngenuineness of commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In specific, a significant\nportion of instances in some commonsense benchmarks do not concern commonsense\nknowledge. That problem would undermine the measurement of the true commonsense\nreasoning ability of evaluated models. It is also suggested that the problem\noriginated from a blurry concept of commonsense knowledge, as distinguished\nfrom other types of knowledge. To demystify all of the above claims, in this\nstudy, we survey existing definitions of commonsense knowledge, ground into the\nthree frameworks for defining concepts, and consolidate them into a\nmulti-framework unified definition of commonsense knowledge (so-called\nconsolidated definition). We then use the consolidated definition for\nannotations and experiments on the CommonsenseQA and CommonsenseQA 2.0 datasets\nto examine the above claims. Our study shows that there exists a large portion\nof non-commonsense-knowledge instances in the two datasets, and a large\nperformance gap on these two subsets where Large Language Models (LLMs) perform\nworse on commonsense-knowledge instances.",

Recent years have seen significant\nadvancements in SAR ATR technology based on semi-supervised learning. However,\nexisting semi-supervised SAR ATR algorithms show low recognition accuracy in\nthe case of class imbalance. This work offers a non-balanced semi-supervised\nSAR target recognition approach using dynamic energy scores and adaptive loss.\nFirst, an energy score-based method is developed to dynamically select\nunlabeled samples near to the training distribution as pseudo-labels during\ntraining, assuring pseudo-label reliability in long-tailed distribution\ncircumstances. Secondly, loss functions suitable for class imbalances are\nproposed, including adaptive margin perception loss and adaptive hard triplet\nloss, the former offsets inter-class confusion of classifiers, alleviating the\nimbalance issue inherent in pseudo-label generation. The latter effectively\ntackles the model's preference for the majority class by focusing on complex\ndifficult samples during training. Experimental results on extremely imbalanced\nSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well under the dual\nconstraints of scarce labels and data imbalance, effectively overcoming the\nmodel bias caused by data imbalance and achieving high-precision target\nrecognition.",

More recent works have proposed aligning\nretrievers with the preference signals of LLMs. However, these preference\nsignals are often difficult for dense retrievers, which typically have weaker\nlanguage capabilities, to understand and learn effectively. Drawing inspiration\nfrom pedagogical theories like Guided Discovery Learning, we propose a novel\nframework, FiGRet (Fine-grained Guidance for Retrievers), which leverages the\nlanguage capabilities of LLMs to construct examples from a more granular,\ninformation-centric perspective to guide the learning of retrievers.\nSpecifically, our method utilizes LLMs to construct easy-to-understand examples\nfrom samples where the retriever performs poorly, focusing on three learning\nobjectives highly relevant to the RAG scenario: relevance, comprehensiveness,\nand purity. These examples serve as scaffolding to ultimately align the\nretriever with the LLM's preferences. Furthermore, we employ a dual curriculum\nlearning strategy and leverage the reciprocal feedback between LLM and\nretriever to further enhance the performance of the RAG system. A series of\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the performance of\nRAG systems equipped with different retrievers and is applicable to various\nLLMs.",

Missingness in EHRs\noccurs naturally as a result of the data recording practices during routine\nclinical care, but handling it is crucial to the precision of medical analysis\nand the decision-making that follows. The literature contains a variety of\nimputation methodologies based on deep neural networks. Those aim to overcome\nthe dynamic, heterogeneous and multivariate missingness patterns of EHRs, which\ncannot be handled by classical and statistical imputation methods. However, all\nexisting deep imputation methods rely on end-to-end pipelines that incorporate\nboth imputation and downstream analyses, e.g. classification. This coupling\nmakes it difficult to assess the quality of imputation and takes away the\nflexibility of re-using the imputer for a different task. Furthermore, most\nend-to-end deep architectures tend to use complex networks to perform the\ndownstream task, in addition to the already sophisticated deep imputation\nnetwork. We, therefore ask if the high performance reported in the literature\nis due to the imputer or the classifier and further ask if an optimised\nstate-of-the-art imputer is used, a simpler classifier can achieve comparable\nperformance. This paper explores the development of a modular, deep\nlearning-based imputation and classification pipeline, specifically built to\nleverage the capabilities of state-of-the-art imputation models for downstream\nclassification tasks. Such a modular approach enables a) objective assessment\nof the quality of the imputer and classifier independently, and b) enables the\nexploration of the performance of simpler classification architectures using an\noptimised imputer.",

    "abstract": "Post-training quantization is widely employed to reduce the computational\ndemands of neural networks. Typically, individual substructures, such as layers\nor blocks of layers, are quantized with the objective of minimizing\nquantization errors in their pre-activations by fine-tuning the corresponding\nweights. Deriving this local objective from the global objective of minimizing\ntask loss involves two key simplifications: assuming substructures are mutually\nindependent and ignoring the knowledge of subsequent substructures as well as\nthe task loss. In this work, we assess the effects of these simplifications on\nweight-only quantization of large language models. We introduce two multi-block\nfine-tuning strategies and compare them against the baseline of fine-tuning\nsingle transformer blocks. The first captures correlations of weights across\nblocks by jointly optimizing multiple quantized blocks. The second incorporates\nknowledge of subsequent blocks by minimizing the error in downstream\npre-activations rather than focusing solely on the quantized block. Our\nfindings indicate that the effectiveness of these methods depends on the\nspecific network model, with no impact on some models but demonstrating\nsignificant benefits for others.",

It is well known that one of the key challenges in\ninterpreting natural language questions with respect to SPARQL lies in bridging\nthe lexical gap, that is mapping the words in the query to the correct\nvocabulary elements. We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is\nexplicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect\nto the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the\nperformance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA\nsystem that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner\nto infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query. We show that\nsuch a system, given lexical knowledge, has a performance well beyond current\nQA systems, achieving up to a $35.8\\%$ increase in the micro $F_1$ score\ncompared to the best QA system on QALD-9. This shows the importance and\npotential of including explicit lexical knowledge. In contrast, we show that\nLLMs have limited abilities to exploit lexical knowledge, with only marginal\nimprovements compared to a version without lexical knowledge. This shows that\nLLMs have no ability to compositionally interpret a question on the basis of\nthe meaning of its parts, a key feature of compositional approaches. Taken\ntogether, our work shows new avenues for QALD research, emphasizing the\nimportance of lexicalization and compositionality.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of edge computing technologies and the\nincreasing prevalence of deep learning models in these environments, the\nsecurity risks and privacy threats to models and data have grown more acute.\nAttackers can exploit various techniques to illegally obtain models or misuse\ndata, leading to serious issues such as intellectual property infringement and\nprivacy breaches. Existing model access control technologies primarily rely on\ntraditional encryption and authentication methods; however, these approaches\nexhibit significant limitations in terms of flexibility and adaptability in\ndynamic environments. Although there have been advancements in model\nwatermarking techniques for marking model ownership, they remain limited in\ntheir ability to proactively protect intellectual property and prevent\nunauthorized access. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model\naccess control method tailored for edge computing environments. This method\nleverages image style as a licensing mechanism, embedding style recognition\ninto the model's operational framework to enable intrinsic access control.\nConsequently, models deployed on edge platforms are designed to correctly infer\nonly on license data with specific style, rendering them ineffective on any\nother data. By restricting the input data to the edge model, this approach not\nonly prevents attackers from gaining unauthorized access to the model but also\nenhances the privacy of data on terminal devices. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FACESCRUB,\nand the results demonstrate that our method effectively prevents unauthorized\naccess to the model while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the model shows\nstrong resistance against attacks such as forged licenses and fine-tuning.\nThese results underscore the method's usability, security, and robustness.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for accurate and robust 6D pose estimation\nof novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose\ncan utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD\nmodel, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input.\nSpecifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse\nestimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight\nU-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is\ndesigned. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can\ngenerate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose\nformulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or\nBundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to\nextend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that\nrefines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images.\nGS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve\nenvironmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and\nflexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging\ndisruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the\nLineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly\ncompetitive results.

    "abstract": "Federated learning enables multiple actors to collaboratively train models\nwithout sharing private data. This unlocks the potential for scaling machine\nlearning to diverse applications. Existing algorithms for this task are\nwell-justified when clients and the intended target domain share the same\ndistribution of features and labels, but this assumption is often violated in\nreal-world scenarios. One common violation is label shift, where the label\ndistributions differ across clients or between clients and the target domain,\nwhich can significantly degrade model performance. To address this problem, we\npropose FedPALS, a novel model aggregation scheme that adapts to label shifts\nby leveraging knowledge of the target label distribution at the central server.\nOur approach ensures unbiased updates under stochastic gradient descent,\nensuring robust generalization across clients with diverse, label-shifted data.\nExtensive experiments on image classification demonstrate that FedPALS\nconsistently outperforms standard baselines by aligning model aggregation with\nthe target domain. Our findings reveal that conventional federated learning\nmethods suffer severely in cases of extreme client sparsity, highlighting the\ncritical need for target-aware aggregation. FedPALS offers a principled and\npractical solution to mitigate label distribution mismatch, ensuring models\ntrained in federated settings can generalize effectively to label-shifted\ntarget domains.",

Video Quality Assessment (VQA), a\nclassic field in low-level visual perception, focused initially on quantitative\nvideo quality scoring. However, driven by advances in LMMs, it is now\nprogressing toward more holistic visual quality understanding tasks. Recent\nstudies in the image domain have demonstrated that Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) can markedly enhance low-level visual quality evaluation. Nevertheless,\nrelated work has not been explored in the video domain, leaving substantial\nroom for improvement. To address this gap, we introduce the VQA2 Instruction\nDataset - the first visual question answering instruction dataset that focuses\non video quality assessment. This dataset consists of 3 subsets and covers\nvarious video types, containing 157,755 instruction question-answer pairs.\nThen, leveraging this foundation, we present the VQA2 series models. The VQA2\nseries models interleave visual and motion tokens to enhance the perception of\nspatial-temporal quality details in videos. We conduct extensive experiments on\nvideo quality scoring and understanding tasks, and results demonstrate that the\nVQA2series models achieve excellent performance in both tasks. Notably, our\nfinal model, the VQA2-Assistant, exceeds the renowned GPT-4o in visual quality\nunderstanding tasks while maintaining strong competitiveness in quality scoring\ntasks.

The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We\nalso finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1)\nnaive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2)\nsurprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for\nfinetuning pretrained models.

To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce subspace diffusion model with orthogonal\ndecomposition, a method (referred to as Sub-DM) that restrict the diffusion\nprocess via projections onto subspace as the k-space data distribution evolves\ntoward noise. Particularly, the subspace diffusion model circumvents the\ninference challenges posed by the com-plex and high-dimensional characteristics\nof k-space data, so the highly compact subspace ensures that diffusion process\nrequires only a few simple iterations to produce accurate prior information.\nFurthermore, the orthogonal decomposition strategy based on wavelet transform\nhin-ders the information loss during the migration of the vanilla diffusion\nprocess to the subspace. Considering the strate-gy is approximately reversible,\nsuch that the entire pro-cess can be reversed. As a result, it allows the\ndiffusion processes in different spaces to refine models through a mutual\nfeedback mechanism, enabling the learning of ac-curate prior even when dealing\nwith complex k-space data.

    "abstract": "We introduce PropNEAT, a fast backpropagation implementation of NEAT that\nuses a bidirectional mapping of the genome graph to a layer-based architecture\nthat preserves the NEAT genomes whilst enabling efficient GPU backpropagation.\nWe test PropNEAT on 58 binary classification datasets from the Penn Machine\nLearning Benchmarks database, comparing the performance against logistic\nregression, dense neural networks and random forests, as well as a densely\nretrained variant of the final PropNEAT model. PropNEAT had the second best\noverall performance, behind Random Forest, though the difference between the\nmodels was not statistically significant apart from between Random Forest in\ncomparison with logistic regression and the PropNEAT retrain models. PropNEAT\nwas substantially faster than a naive backpropagation method, and both were\nsubstantially faster and had better performance than the original NEAT\nimplementation. We demonstrate that the per-epoch training time for PropNEAT\nscales linearly with network depth, and is efficient on GPU implementations for\nbackpropagation. This implementation could be extended to support reinforcement\nlearning or convolutional networks, and is able to find sparser and smaller\nnetworks with potential for applications in low-power contexts.",

However, extracting GD&T information from\n2D engineering drawings is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, often\nrelying on manual efforts or semi-automated tools. To address these challenges,\nthis study proposes an automated and computationally efficient GD&T extraction\nmethod by fine-tuning Florence-2, an open-source vision-language model (VLM).\nThe model is trained on a dataset of 400 drawings with ground truth annotations\nprovided by domain experts. For comparison, two state-of-the-art closed-source\nVLMs, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, are evaluated on the same dataset. All\nmodels are assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and hallucination\nmetrics. Due to the computational cost and impracticality of fine-tuning large\nclosed-source VLMs for domain-specific tasks, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet are\nevaluated in a zero-shot setting. In contrast, Florence-2, a smaller model with\n0.23 billion parameters, is optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning across\nthree distinct experiments, each utilizing datasets augmented to different\nlevels. The results show that Florence-2 achieves a 29.95% increase in\nprecision, a 37.75% increase in recall, a 52.40% improvement in F1-score, and a\n43.15% reduction in hallucination rate compared to the best-performing\nclosed-source model.

Domain\nadaptation and domain generalization have been studied extensively as\napproaches to address distribution shifts across test and train domains, but\neach has its limitations. Test-time adaptation, a recently emerging learning\nparadigm, combines the benefits of domain adaptation and domain generalization\nby training models only on source data and adapting them to target data during\ntest-time inference. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic\nreview on test-time adaptation, covering more than 400 recent papers. We\nstructure our review by categorizing existing methods into five distinct\ncategories based on what component of the method is adjusted for test-time\nadaptation: the model, the inference, the normalization, the sample, or the\nprompt, providing detailed analysis of each. We further discuss the various\npreparation and adaptation settings for methods within these categories,\noffering deeper insights into the effective deployment for the evaluation of\ndistribution shifts and their real-world application in understanding images,\nvideo and 3D, as well as modalities beyond vision.

Traditional\narchitectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and\nself-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range\ndependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address\nthese issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for\nSSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the\nMamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic\nsegmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and\ngeometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge.\nUsing simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception\ntraining of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby\nconnected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive\nlabels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a\ndual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling\nefficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing\nlong-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks\nwith deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone\nnetwork. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaSSC achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing models\nwhile also reducing deployment costs.",

    "abstract": "Designing a fast and effective entropy model is challenging but essential for\npractical application of neural codecs. Beyond spatial autoregressive entropy\nmodels, more efficient backward adaptation-based entropy models have been\nrecently developed. They not only reduce decoding time by using smaller number\nof modeling steps but also maintain or even improve rate--distortion\nperformance by leveraging more diverse contexts for backward adaptation.\nDespite their significant progress, we argue that their performance has been\nlimited by the simple adoption of the design convention for forward adaptation:\nusing only a single type of hyper latent representation, which does not provide\nsufficient contextual information, especially in the first modeling step. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet effective entropy modeling framework that\nleverages sufficient contexts for forward adaptation without compromising on\nbit-rate. Specifically, we introduce a strategy of diversifying hyper latent\nrepresentations for forward adaptation, i.e., using two additional types of\ncontexts along with the existing single type of context. In addition, we\npresent a method to effectively use the diverse contexts for contextualizing\nthe current elements to be encoded/decoded. By addressing the limitation of the\nprevious approach, our proposed framework leads to significant performance\nimprovements. Experimental results on popular datasets show that our proposed\nframework consistently improves rate--distortion performance across various\nbit-rate regions, e.g., 3.73% BD-rate gain over the state-of-the-art baseline\non the Kodak dataset.",

The challenge in identifying such\nuncertain points is balancing between being overly cautious (high recall) and\noverly confident (high precision).

We formalize this problem as one of policy\naggregation, where the goal is to identify a desirable collective policy. We\nargue that an approach informed by social choice theory is especially suitable.\nOur key insight is that social choice methods can be reinterpreted by\nidentifying ordinal preferences with volumes of subsets of the state-action\noccupancy polytope. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that a variety of\nmethods--including approval voting, Borda count, the proportional veto core,\nand quantile fairness--can be practically applied to policy aggregation.",

Traditional approaches\noften tackle each task separately by its own network, which leads to excessive\ncosts for developing and scaling models, especially in the context of large\nlanguage models. Although multi-task methods can save costs through parameter\nsharing, they often struggle to outperform single-task methods in real-world\napplications. To tackle these challenges, we present a three-stage multi-task\nlearning framework for large language models. It involves task filtering,\nfollowed by fine-tuning on high-resource tasks, and finally fine-tuning on all\ntasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments in single-task and multi-task\nsettings. Our approach, exemplified on different benchmarks, demonstrates that\nit is able to achieve performance comparable to the single-task method while\nreducing up to 90.9\\% of its overhead.",

However,\nexisting algorithms struggle with precise pixel-level feature matching,\nlimiting their ability to fully exploit geometric constraints across different\nspectra. To address this, we propose a novel framework incorporating stereo\ndepth estimation to enforce accurate geometric constraints. In particular, we\ntreat the visible light and thermal images as a stereo pair and utilize a\nCross-modal Feature Matching (CFM) Module to construct a cost volume for\npixel-level matching. To mitigate the effects of poor lighting on stereo\nmatching, we introduce Degradation Masking, which leverages robust monocular\nthermal depth estimation in degraded regions. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS2) dataset,\nwith qualitative evaluations demonstrating high-quality depth maps under\nvarying lighting conditions.",

    "abstract": "Current neural network models of primate vision focus on replicating overall\nlevels of behavioral accuracy, often neglecting perceptual decisions' rich,\ndynamic nature. Here, we introduce a novel computational framework to model the\ndynamics of human behavioral choices by learning to align the temporal dynamics\nof a recurrent neural network (RNN) to human reaction times (RTs). We describe\nan approximation that allows us to constrain the number of time steps an RNN\ntakes to solve a task with human RTs. The approach is extensively evaluated\nagainst various psychophysics experiments. We also show that the approximation\ncan be used to optimize an \"ideal-observer\" RNN model to achieve an optimal\ntradeoff between speed and accuracy without human data. The resulting model is\nfound to account well for human RT data. Finally, we use the approximation to\ntrain a deep learning implementation of the popular Wong-Wang decision-making\nmodel. The model is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model\nof visual processing and evaluated using both artificial and natural image\nstimuli. Overall, we present a novel framework that helps align current vision\nmodels with human behavior, bringing us closer to an integrated model of human\nvision.",

This presents a significant gap compared to the human ability to\nwatch, listen, think, and respond to streaming inputs in real time,\nhighlighting the limitations of current MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce\nStreamingBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\nstreaming video understanding capabilities of MLLMs. StreamingBench assesses\nthree core aspects of streaming video understanding: (1) real-time visual\nunderstanding, (2) omni-source understanding, and (3) contextual understanding.\nThe benchmark consists of 18 tasks, featuring 900 videos and 4,500\nhuman-curated QA pairs. Each video features five questions presented at\ndifferent time points to simulate a continuous streaming scenario. We conduct\nexperiments on StreamingBench with 13 open-source and proprietary MLLMs and\nfind that even the most advanced proprietary MLLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro and\nGPT-4o perform significantly below human-level streaming video understanding\ncapabilities.

    "abstract": "Multispectral pedestrian detection has gained significant attention in recent\nyears, particularly in autonomous driving applications. To address the\nchallenges posed by adversarial illumination conditions, the combination of\nthermal and visible images has demonstrated its advantages. However, existing\nfusion methods rely on the critical assumption that the RGB-Thermal (RGB-T)\nimage pairs are fully overlapping. These assumptions often do not hold in\nreal-world applications, where only partial overlap between images can occur\ndue to sensors configuration. Moreover, sensor failure can cause loss of\ninformation in one modality. In this paper, we propose a novel module called\nthe Hybrid Attention (HA) mechanism as our main contribution to mitigate\nperformance degradation caused by partial overlap and sensor failure, i.e. when\nat least part of the scene is acquired by only one sensor. We propose an\nimproved RGB-T fusion algorithm, robust against partial overlap and sensor\nfailure encountered during inference in real-world applications. We also\nleverage a mobile-friendly backbone to cope with resource constraints in\nembedded systems. We conducted experiments by simulating various partial\noverlap and sensor failure scenarios to evaluate the performance of our\nproposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superiority in handling real-world\nchallenges.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of semantic parsing, significant progress has been achieved in\nText-to-SQL and question-answering tasks, both of which focus on extracting\ninformation from data sources in their native formats. However, the inherent\nconstraints of their formal meaning representations, such as SQL programming\nlanguage or basic logical forms, hinder their ability to analyze data from\nvarious perspectives, such as conducting statistical analyses. To address this\nlimitation and inspire research in this field, we design SIGMA, a new dataset\nfor Text-to-Code semantic parsing with statistical analysis. SIGMA comprises\n6000 questions with corresponding Python code labels, spanning across 160\ndatabases. Half of the questions involve query types, which return information\nin its original format, while the remaining 50% are statistical analysis\nquestions, which perform statistical operations on the data. The Python code\nlabels in our dataset cover 4 types of query types and 40 types of statistical\nanalysis patterns. We evaluated the SIGMA dataset using three different\nbaseline models: LGESQL, SmBoP, and SLSQL. The experimental results show that\nthe LGESQL model with ELECTRA outperforms all other models, achieving 83.37%\nstructure accuracy. In terms of execution accuracy, the SmBoP model, when\ncombined with GraPPa and T5, reaches 76.38%.",

Given the prevalence of multivariate time\nseries (MTS) data across various domains, the UDA task for MTS classification\nhas emerged as a critical challenge. However, for MTS data, correlations\nbetween variables often vary across domains, whereas most existing UDA works\nfor MTS classification have overlooked this essential characteristic. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel domain shift, {\\em correlation shift}, measuring\ndomain differences in multivariate correlation. To mitigate correlation shift,\nwe propose a scalable and parameter-efficient \\underline{C}orrelation\n\\underline{A}dapter for M\\underline{TS} (CATS). Designed as a plug-and-play\ntechnique compatible with various Transformer variants, CATS employs temporal\nconvolution to capture local temporal patterns and a graph attention module to\nmodel the changing multivariate correlation. The adapter reweights the target\ncorrelations to align the source correlations with a theoretically guaranteed\nprecision. A correlation alignment loss is further proposed to mitigate\ncorrelation shift, bypassing the alignment challenge from the non-i.i.d. nature\nof MTS data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that\n(1) compared with vanilla Transformer-based models, CATS increases over $10\\%$\naverage accuracy while only adding around $1\\%$ parameters, and (2) all\nTransformer variants equipped with CATS either reach or surpass\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Given text and\nimages from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers,\nwe build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category\n(e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description.\nWe then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve\nthe same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM\nprompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In\nparticular, the embeddings approach has 49.5% higher accuracy than the\nprompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only,\nimage-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields\nwell-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to\nprovide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary,\nprompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is\n14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text\nrespectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10\ntimes cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the\nembeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent\nwith our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification\nproblems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach\nmay yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners,\nengineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and\nconsider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases.",

For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of\nNavier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate\nhigh-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and\nvortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural networks depends on\naccurately reconstructing moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been\nwell known that deep neural nets exhibit the so-called spectral bias toward\nlearning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)\nhave emerged as a popular class of data-driven models in recent years for\nsolving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for surrogate modeling in\ngeneral. Although impressive results have been achieved on several PDE\nbenchmark problems, FNOs often perform poorly in learning non-dominant\nfrequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from the\nspectral bias inherent in neural networks and the explicit exclusion of\nhigh-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these\nissues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad\nrange of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements:\n(i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolutions (ii) a\nhigh-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel\nfrequency-sensitive loss term based on radially binned spectral errors. This\nintroduction of a parallel branch for local convolutions reduces number of\ntrainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of baseline FNO\nthat relies solely on global convolutions.

Nevertheless, adapting\nto a target subject presents significant challenges due to large distributional\ndifferences between source and target domains, often resulting in negative\ntransfer. In addition, integrating all sources simultaneously increases\ncomputational costs and causes misalignment with the target. To address these\nissues, we propose a progressive MSDA approach that gradually introduces\ninformation from subjects based on their similarity to the target subject. This\nwill ensure that only the most relevant sources from the target are selected,\nwhich helps avoid the negative transfer caused by dissimilar sources. We first\nexploit the closest sources to reduce the distribution shift with the target\nand then move towards the furthest while only considering the most relevant\nsources based on the predetermined threshold. Furthermore, to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting caused by the incremental introduction of source\nsubjects, we implemented a density-based memory mechanism that preserves the\nmost relevant historical source samples for adaptation.

Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing have promised transformative\nadvances in this area through real-time data integration and automated\nproduction planning and control. However, the reliance on automation alone has\noften fallen short, lacking the flexibility needed for complex processes. To\nfully unlock the potential of smart manufacturing, we must evolve from\nautomation to autonomous systems that go beyond rigid programming and can\ndynamically optimize the search for solutions. Current discovery approaches are\noften slow, requiring numerous trials to find optimal combinations, and costly,\nparticularly when optimizing multiple properties simultaneously.

The framework leverages sequential learning through Bayesian\nOptimization, which iteratively refines a statistical model representing the\nunderlying manufacturing process. This statistical model acts as a surrogate,\nallowing for efficient exploration and optimization without requiring numerous\nreal-world experiments. This approach can significantly reduce the time and\ncost of data collection required by traditional experimental designs. The\nproposed framework is compared with traditional DoE methods and two other\nmulti-objective optimization methods. Using a manufacturing dataset, we\nevaluate and compare the performance of these approaches across five evaluation\nmetrics.

    "abstract": "The evolution of ARM-based architectures, particularly those incorporating\nScalable Vector Extension (SVE), has introduced transformative opportunities\nfor high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) workloads. The\nUnified Acceleration Foundation's (UXL) oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)\nis a widely adopted library for accelerating ML and data analytics workflows,\nbut its reliance on Intel's proprietary Math Kernel Library (MKL) has\ntraditionally limited its compatibility to x86platforms. This paper details the\nporting of oneDAL to ARM architectures with SVE support, using OpenBLAS as an\nalternative backend to overcome architectural and performance challenges.\nBeyond porting, the research introduces novel ARM-specific optimizations,\nincluding custom sparse matrix routines, vectorized statistical functions, and\na Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)-optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nalgorithm. The SVM enhancements leverage SVE's flexible vector lengths and\npredicate driven execution, achieving notable performance gains of 22% for the\nBoser method and 5% for the Thunder method. Benchmarks conducted on ARM\nSVE-enabled AWSGraviton3 instances showcase up to 200x acceleration in ML\ntraining and inference tasks compared to the original scikit-learn\nimplementation on the ARM platform. Moreover, the ARM-optimized oneDAL achieves\nperformance parity with, and in some cases exceeds, the x86 oneDAL\nimplementation (MKL backend) on IceLake x86 systems, which are nearly twice as\ncostly as AWSGraviton3 ARM instances. These findings highlight ARM's potential\nas a high-performance, energyefficient platform for dataintensive ML\napplications. By expanding cross-architecture compatibility and contributing to\nthe opensource ecosystem, this work reinforces ARM's position as a competitive\nalternative in the HPC and ML domains, paving the way for future advancements\nin dataintensive computing.",

To understand\nthis effect, we analyze their interaction with core architectural components of\nLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that these sensitive parameters are closely\nlinked to the positional encoding module, particularly in models using Rotary\nPosition Embedding (RoPE), where perturbations disrupt dominant-frequency\nactivations critical for contextual processing. Furthermore, we show that\nperturbing ToM-sensitive parameters affects LLM's attention mechanism by\nmodulating the angle between queries and keys under positional encoding. These\ninsights provide a deeper understanding of how LLMs acquire social reasoning\nabilities, bridging AI interpretability with cognitive science.

Large language models (LLMs),\nknown for their strong generalization capabilities, have shown promising\nperformance in various domains.

We evaluate TrafficLLM across 10\ndistinct scenarios and 229 types of traffic. TrafficLLM achieves F1-scores of\n0.9875 and 0.9483, with up to 80.12% and 33.92% better performance than\nexisting detection and generation methods. It also shows strong generalization\non unseen traffic with an 18.6% performance improvement. We further evaluate\nTrafficLLM in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about a latent entity is a\ncritical task in many application domains, e.g., assessing individual student\nlearning outcomes, diagnosing underlying diseases, or learning user\npreferences. Though natural language is a powerful medium for this purpose,\nlarge language models (LLMs) and existing fine-tuning algorithms lack\nmechanisms for strategically gathering information to refine their own\nunderstanding of the latent entity. To harness the generalization power and\nworld knowledge of LLMs in developing effective information-gathering\nstrategies, we propose an adaptive elicitation framework that actively reduces\nuncertainty on the latent entity. Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract\nlatent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of\nuncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future\nobservations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex\nnatural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model\nquantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the\ndevelopment of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the\nmost informative next queries. In experiments on the 20 questions game, dynamic\nopinion polling, and adaptive student assessment, our method consistently\noutperforms baselines in identifying critical unknowns and improving downstream\npredictions, illustrating the promise of strategic information gathering in\nnatural language settings.",

    "abstract": "The Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to track changes in students' knowledge\nstatus and predict their future answers based on their historical answer\nrecords. Current research on KT modeling focuses on predicting student' future\nperformance based on existing, unupdated records of student learning\ninteractions. However, these approaches ignore the distractors (such as\nslipping and guessing) in the answering process and overlook that static\ncognitive representations are temporary and limited. Most of them assume that\nthere are no distractors in the answering process and that the record\nrepresentations fully represent the students' level of understanding and\nproficiency in knowledge. In this case, it may lead to many insynergy and\nincoordination issue in the original records. Therefore we propose a Cognitive\nRepresentation Optimization for Knowledge Tracing (CRO-KT) model, which\nutilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize structure of cognitive\nrepresentations. This ensures that the structure matches the students'\ncognitive patterns in terms of the difficulty of the exercises. Furthermore, we\nuse the co-optimization algorithm to optimize the cognitive representations of\nthe sub-target exercises in terms of the overall situation of exercises\nresponses by considering all the exercises with co-relationships as a single\ngoal. Meanwhile, the CRO-KT model fuses the learned relational embeddings from\nthe bipartite graph with the optimized record representations in a weighted\nmanner, enhancing the expression of students' cognition. Finally, experiments\nare conducted on three publicly available datasets respectively to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed cognitive representation optimization model.",

    "abstract": "A persistent challenge in AI is the effective integration of material and\nformal inference - the former concerning the plausibility and contextual\nrelevance of arguments, while the latter focusing on their logical and\nstructural validity. Large Language Models (LLMs), by virtue of their extensive\npre-training on large textual corpora, exhibit strong capabilities in material\ninference. However, their reasoning often lacks formal rigour and\nverifiability. At the same time, LLMs' linguistic competence positions them as\na promising bridge between natural and formal languages, opening up new\nopportunities for combining these two modes of reasoning. In this paper, we\nintroduce PEIRCE, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to unify material and\nformal inference through an iterative conjecture-criticism process. Within this\nframework, LLMs play the central role of generating candidate solutions in\nnatural and formal languages, which are then evaluated and refined via\ninteraction with external critique models. These critiques include symbolic\nprovers, which assess formal validity, as well as soft evaluators that measure\nthe quality of the generated arguments along linguistic and epistemic\ndimensions such as plausibility, coherence, and parsimony. While PEIRCE is a\ngeneral-purpose framework, we demonstrate its capabilities in the domain of\nnatural language explanation generation - a setting that inherently demands\nboth material adequacy and formal correctness.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious tasks; however, the challenge of hallucinations constrains their\npractical applications. The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors,\nincluding the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of\nvisual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data.\nExtensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance,\nOPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on \"anchor tokens\", thereby\nreducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a\ncontrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation\nbetween the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of\nhallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time\nAccumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically\naccumulates and updates LVLMs' attention on image tokens during generation. By\nenhancing the model's attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations\ncaused by the decay of attention on image tokens. We validate the effectiveness\nof TARAC across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach\nsubstantially mitigates hallucinations. In particular, TARAC reduces $C_S$ by\n25.2 and $C_I$ by 8.7 compared to VCD on the CHAIR benchmark.",

Existing ER-TTE methods always make re-estimation\nwhich significantly hinders real-time performance, especially when faced with\nthe computational demands of simultaneous user requests.

We propose a general efficient\nframework U-ERTTE combining an Uncertainty-Guided Decision mechanism (UGD) and\nFine-Tuning with Meta-Learning (FTML) to address these challenges. UGD\nquantifies the uncertainty and provides confidence intervals for the entire\nroute.

To ensure the accuracy of confidence intervals and accurate predictions\nthat need to re-estimate, FTML is employed to train the model, enabling it to\nlearn general driving patterns and specific features to adapt to specific\ntasks. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real datasets demonstrate that\nthe U-ERTTE framework significantly enhances inference speed and throughput\nwhile maintaining high effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Prior studies on deception in language-based AI agents typically assess\nwhether the agent produces a false statement about a topic, or makes a binary\nchoice prompted by a goal, rather than allowing open-ended deceptive behavior\nto emerge in pursuit of a longer-term goal. To fix this, we introduce\n$\\textit{Among Us}$, a sandbox social deception game where LLM-agents exhibit\nlong-term, open-ended deception as a consequence of the game objectives. While\nmost benchmarks saturate quickly, $\\textit{Among Us}$ can be expected to last\nmuch longer, because it is a multi-player game far from equilibrium. Using the\nsandbox, we evaluate $18$ proprietary and open-weight LLMs and uncover a\ngeneral trend: models trained with RL are comparatively much better at\nproducing deception than detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of methods\nto detect lying and deception: logistic regression on the activations and\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs). We find that probes trained on a dataset of\n``pretend you're a dishonest model: $\\dots$'' generalize extremely well\nout-of-distribution, consistently obtaining AUROCs over 95% even when evaluated\njust on the deceptive statement, without the chain of thought.

We also explore prompt refinement techniques\nand demonstrate that decomposing the task into smaller subtasks does not easily\nalleviate these limitations. Our findings highlight important challenges in\ncurrent text-to-video generation and provide insights for future research aimed\nat improving adherence to basic numerical constraints.",

    "abstract": "Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for\nautomated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where\nperformance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent\nPathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology\ndata, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they\nlack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical\ntaxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation\nmodel analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design.\nAdditionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into\nslide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing\ncomprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical\nchallenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end\npretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation,\nmodel maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising\nfield.

We introduce Actively Discovering and\nAdapting to Preferences for any Task (ADAPT) -- a benchmark designed to\nevaluate agents' ability to adhere to user preferences across various household\ntasks through active questioning. Next, we propose Reflection-DPO, a novel\ntraining approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to the task of\nactive questioning. Reflection-DPO finetunes a 'student' LLM to follow the\nactions of a privileged 'teacher' LLM, and optionally ask a question to gather\nnecessary information to better predict the teacher action. We find that prior\napproaches that use state-of-the-art LLMs fail to sufficiently follow user\npreferences in ADAPT due to insufficient questioning and poor adherence to\nelicited preferences. In contrast, Reflection-DPO achieves a higher rate of\nsatisfying user preferences, outperforming a zero-shot chain-of-thought\nbaseline by 6.1% on unseen users.",

We consider\na structural regularization algorithm that incorporates a generalized\n$\\ell_2$-regularization tailored to the Hessian of the previous task for\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. We establish upper and lower bounds on the\njoint excess risk for this algorithm. Our analysis reveals a fundamental\ntrade-off between memory complexity and statistical efficiency, where memory\ncomplexity is measured by the number of vectors needed to define the structural\nregularization. Specifically, increasing the number of vectors in structural\nregularization leads to a worse memory complexity but an improved excess risk,\nand vice versa. Furthermore, our theory suggests that naive continual learning\nwithout regularization suffers from catastrophic forgetting, while structural\nregularization mitigates this issue. Notably, structural regularization\nachieves comparable performance to joint training with access to both tasks\nsimultaneously. These results highlight the critical role of curvature-aware\nregularization for continual learning.",

Through the\nconvergence curve analysis of the loss function, the experiment verifies that\nthe method can converge stably during the training process and effectively\navoid serious overfitting. Further experimental results show that the model has\nstrong adaptability on different data sets, can effectively extract\nhigh-quality features from unlabeled data, and improves classification\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Event cameras are emerging vision sensors, whose noise is challenging to\ncharacterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras consider other tasks\nsuch as motion estimation separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising).\nHowever, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be\nsensed without motion. This work proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the\nfirst method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g.,\nego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows\nreplacing the 1-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization\nframework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The\nexperiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on\nthe E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark,\nwhile showing its efficacy on motion estimation and intensity reconstruction\ntasks. We believe that the proposed approach contributes to strengthening the\ntheory of event-data denoising, as well as impacting practical denoising\nuse-cases, as we release the code upon acceptance.

Current\napproaches either represent irregular shapes via box-to-polygon strategy or\ndecomposing a contour into pieces for fitting gradually, the deficiency of\ncoarse contours or complex pipelines always exists in these models. Considering\nthe above issues, we introduce EdgeText to fit text contours compactly while\nalleviating excessive contour rebuilding processes. Concretely, it is observed\nthat the two long edges of texts can be regarded as smooth curves. It allows us\nto build contours via continuous and smooth edges that cover text regions\ntightly instead of fitting piecewise, which helps avoid the two limitations in\ncurrent models. Inspired by this observation, EdgeText formulates the text\nrepresentation as the edge approximation problem via parameterized curve\nfitting functions. In the inference stage, our model starts with locating text\ncenters, and then creating curve functions for approximating text edges relying\non the points. Meanwhile, truncation points are determined based on the\nlocation features. In the end, extracting curve segments from curve functions\nby using the pixel coordinate information brought by truncation points to\nreconstruct text contours. Furthermore, considering the deep dependency of\nEdgeText on text edges, a bilateral enhanced perception (BEP) module is\ndesigned. It encourages our model to pay attention to the recognition of edge\nfeatures. Additionally, to accelerate the learning of the curve function\nparameters, we introduce a proportional integral loss (PI-loss) to force the\nproposed model to focus on the curve distribution and avoid being disturbed by\ntext scales.",

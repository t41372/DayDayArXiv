However,\nrecent works extending CLIP suffer from the issue of modality gap, which arises\nwhen the image and text embeddings are projected to disparate manifolds,\ndeviating from the intended objective of image-text contrastive learning. We\ndiscover that this phenomenon is linked to the modality-specific characteristic\nthat each image/text encoder independently possesses and propose two methods to\naddress the modality gap: (1) a post-hoc embedding standardization method,\n$\\text{I0T}_{\\text{post}}$ that reduces the modality gap approximately to zero\nand (2) a trainable method, $\\text{I0T}_{\\text{async}}$, to alleviate the\nmodality gap problem by adding two normalization layers for each encoder. Our\nI0T framework can significantly reduce the modality gap while preserving the\noriginal embedding representations of trained models with their locked\nparameters. In practice, $\\text{I0T}_{\\text{post}}$ can serve as an alternative\nexplainable automatic evaluation metric of widely used CLIPScore (CLIP-S).",

Recently,\nlearning-based approaches have shown potential to speed up MIP solving via\noffline training that then guides important design decisions during search.\nHowever, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on\noffline training, which requires collecting training datasets and\ncomputationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization\nto unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive\nmeta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any\nsupervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive\nlarge-neighborhood search, operating on top of a MIP solver by successive\napplications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search,\nthe selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for\nthe instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive\nexperiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant\nperformance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any\nsingle best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art\nlarge-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly\nconfigurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.",

Several recent approaches utilize \"precision\" and \"recall,\" borrowed\nfrom the classification domain, to individually quantify the output fidelity\n(realism) and output diversity (representation of the real data variation),\nrespectively. With the increase in metric proposals, there is a need for a\nunifying perspective, allowing for easier comparison and clearer explanation of\ntheir benefits and drawbacks. To this end, we unify a class of\nkth-nearest-neighbors (kNN)-based metrics under an information-theoretic lens\nusing approaches from kNN density estimation. Additionally, we propose a\ntri-dimensional metric composed of Precision Cross-Entropy (PCE), Recall\nCross-Entropy (RCE), and Recall Entropy (RE), which separately measure fidelity\nand two distinct aspects of diversity, inter- and intra-class. Our\ndomain-agnostic metric, derived from the information-theoretic concepts of\nentropy and cross-entropy, can be dissected for both sample- and mode-level\nanalysis. Our detailed experimental results demonstrate the sensitivity of our\nmetric components to their respective qualities and reveal undesirable\nbehaviors of other metrics.",

In this work, we propose a novel inference-aware fine-tuning paradigm,\nin which the model is fine-tuned in a manner that directly optimizes the\nperformance of the inference-time strategy. We study this paradigm using the\nsimple yet effective Best-of-N (BoN) inference strategy, in which a verifier\nselects the best out of a set of LLM-generated responses. We devise the first\nimitation learning and reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for BoN-aware\nfine-tuning, overcoming the challenging, non-differentiable argmax operator\nwithin BoN. We empirically demonstrate that our BoN-aware models implicitly\nlearn a meta-strategy that interleaves best responses with more diverse\nresponses that might be better suited to a test-time input -- a process\nreminiscent of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. Our experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of BoN-aware fine-tuning in terms of improved\nperformance and inference-time compute. In particular, we show that our methods\nimprove the Bo32 performance of Gemma 2B on Hendrycks MATH from 26.8% to 30.8%,\nand pass@32 from 60.0% to 67.0%, as well as the pass@16 on HumanEval from 61.6%\nto 67.1%.",

      "abstract": "Recent research explores the potential of Diffusion Models (DMs) for\nconsistent object editing, which aims to modify object position, size, and\ncomposition, etc., while preserving the consistency of objects and background\nwithout changing their texture and attributes. Current inference-time methods\noften rely on DDIM inversion, which inherently compromises efficiency and the\nachievable consistency of edited images. Recent methods also utilize energy\nguidance which iteratively updates the predicted noise and can drive the\nlatents away from the original image, resulting in distortions. In this paper,\nwe propose PixelMan, an inversion-free and training-free method for achieving\nconsistent object editing via Pixel Manipulation and generation, where we\ndirectly create a duplicate copy of the source object at target location in the\npixel space, and introduce an efficient sampling approach to iteratively\nharmonize the manipulated object into the target location and inpaint its\noriginal location, while ensuring image consistency by anchoring the edited\nimage to be generated to the pixel-manipulated image as well as by introducing\nvarious consistency-preserving optimization techniques during inference.\nExperimental evaluations based on benchmark datasets as well as extensive\nvisual comparisons show that in as few as 16 inference steps, PixelMan\noutperforms a range of state-of-the-art training-based and training-free\nmethods (usually requiring 50 steps) on multiple consistent object editing\ntasks.",

We present ECAR (Efficient Continuous Auto-Regressive\nImage Generation via Multistage Modeling), an approach that addresses these\nlimitations through two intertwined innovations: (1) a stage-wise continuous\ntoken generation strategy that reduces computational complexity and provides\nprogressively refined token maps as hierarchical conditions, and (2) a\nmultistage flow-based distribution modeling method that transforms only\npartial-denoised distributions at each stage comparing to complete denoising in\nnormal diffusion models. Holistically, ECAR operates by generating tokens at\nincreasing resolutions while simultaneously denoising the image at each stage.\nThis design not only reduces token-to-image transformation cost by a factor of\nthe stage number but also enables parallel processing at the token level. Our\napproach not only enhances computational efficiency but also aligns naturally\nwith image generation principles by operating in continuous token space and\nfollowing a hierarchical generation process from coarse to fine details.\nExperimental results demonstrate that ECAR achieves comparable image quality to\nDiT Peebles & Xie [2023] while requiring 10$\\times$ FLOPs reduction and\n5$\\times$ speedup to generate a 256$\\times$256 image.",

However, the non-interpretable, black-box nature\nof this prediction pipeline can be a challenge, especially in critical domains\nsuch as healthcare, finance, and security. In this paper, we explore the\npotential of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for transforming complex,\nnon-interpretable foundation models into interpretable decision-making\npipelines using high-level concept vectors. Specifically, we focus on the\ntest-time deployment of such an interpretable CBM pipeline \"in the wild\", where\nthe input distribution often shifts from the original training distribution. We\nfirst identify the potential failure modes of such a pipeline under different\ntypes of distribution shifts. Then we propose an adaptive concept bottleneck\nframework to address these failure modes, that dynamically adapts the\nconcept-vector bank and the prediction layer based solely on unlabeled data\nfrom the target domain, without access to the source (training) dataset.\nEmpirical evaluations with various real-world distribution shifts show that our\nadaptation method produces concept-based interpretations better aligned with\nthe test data and boosts post-deployment accuracy by up to 28%, aligning the\nCBM performance with that of non-interpretable classification.",

First, we give Claude 3\nOpus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even\nharmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries.\nTo allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained\nonly on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model\ncomplies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost\nnever for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model\ncomplies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit\nalignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically\nanswering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness\nbehavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where\ninformation about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but\nby training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe\nsimilar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the\nmodel to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find\nincreases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases\ncompliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such\nas the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we\nmade alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it\nwas being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it\nany explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their\ntraining process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment\nfaking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this\ncase--or not.",

      "abstract": "Keyword extraction involves identifying the most descriptive words in a\ndocument, allowing automatic categorisation and summarisation of large\nquantities of diverse textual data. Relying on the insight that real-world\nkeyword detection often requires handling of diverse content, we propose a\nnovel supervised keyword extraction approach based on the mixture of experts\n(MoE) technique. MoE uses a learnable routing sub-network to direct information\nto specialised experts, allowing them to specialize in distinct regions of the\ninput space. SEKE, a mixture of Specialised Experts for supervised Keyword\nExtraction, uses DeBERTa as the backbone model and builds on the MoE framework,\nwhere experts attend to each token, by integrating it with a recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN), to allow successful extraction even on smaller corpora, where\nspecialisation is harder due to lack of training data. The MoE framework also\nprovides an insight into inner workings of individual experts, enhancing the\nexplainability of the approach.

Drawing on sociologist Howard Becker's concept of Art\nWorlds, this method expands the scope of traditional AI and creativity\nevaluations beyond benchmarks, user studies with crowd-workers, or focus groups\nconducted with artists. Our method involves two mutually informed dialogues: 1)\n'dialogues with art worlds' placing artists in conversation with experts such\nas art historians, curators, and archivists, and 2)'dialogues with the\nmachine,' facilitated through structured artist- and critic-led experimentation\nwith state-of-the-art generative AI tools. We demonstrate the value of this\nmethod through a case study with artists and experts steeped in non-western art\nworlds, specifically the Persian Gulf. We trace how these dialogues help create\nculturally rich and situated forms of evaluation for representational\npossibilities of generative AI that mimic the reception of generative artwork\nin the broader art ecosystem. Putting artists in conversation with commentators\nalso allow artists to shift their use of the tools to respond to their cultural\nand creative context.

One successful\napproach for developing neural systems which exhibit human-like compositional\ngeneralization is \\textit{hybrid} neurosymbolic techniques. However, these\ntechniques run into the core issues that plague symbolic approaches to AI:\nscalability and flexibility. The reason for this failure is that at their core,\nhybrid neurosymbolic models perform symbolic computation and relegate the\nscalable and flexible neural computation to parameterizing a symbolic system.\nWe investigate a \\textit{unified} neurosymbolic system where transformations in\nthe network can be interpreted simultaneously as both symbolic and neural\ncomputation. We extend a unified neurosymbolic architecture called the\nDifferentiable Tree Machine in two central ways. First, we significantly\nincrease the model's efficiency through the use of sparse vector\nrepresentations of symbolic structures. Second, we enable its application\nbeyond the restricted set of tree2tree problems to the more general class of\nseq2seq problems.

      "abstract": "Text Normalization and Semantic Parsing have numerous applications in natural\nlanguage processing, such as natural language programming, paraphrasing, data\naugmentation, constructing expert systems, text matching, and more. Despite the\nprominent achievements of deep learning in Large Language Models (LLMs), the\ninterpretability of neural network architectures is still poor, which affects\ntheir credibility and hence limits the deployments of risk-sensitive scenarios.\nIn certain scenario-specific domains with scarce data, rapidly obtaining a\nlarge number of supervised learning labels is challenging, and the workload of\nmanually labeling data would be enormous. Catastrophic forgetting in neural\nnetworks further leads to low data utilization rates. In situations where swift\nresponses are vital, the density of the model makes local deployment difficult\nand the response time long, which is not conducive to local applications of\nthese fields. Inspired by the multiplication rule, a principle of combinatorial\nmathematics, and human thinking patterns, a multilayer framework along with its\nalgorithm, the Digestion Algorithm in Hierarchical Symbolic Forests (DAHSF), is\nproposed to address these above issues, combining text normalization and\nsemantic parsing workflows. The Chinese Scripting Language \"Fire Bunny\nIntelligent Development Platform V2.0\" is an important test and application of\nthe technology discussed in this paper.

However, traditional methods often rely on\nstrong, untestable assumptions, which makes them unreliable in real\napplications. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative for\nextracting causal knowledge from text-based metadata, which consolidates domain\nexpertise. However, LLMs are prone to unreliability and hallucinations,\nnecessitating strategies that account for their limitations. One such strategy\ninvolves leveraging a consistency measure to evaluate reliability.\nAdditionally, most text metadata does not clearly distinguish direct causal\nrelationships from indirect ones, further complicating the discovery of a\ncausal DAG. As a result, focusing on causal orderings, rather than causal DAGs,\nemerges as a more practical and robust approach. We propose a novel method to\nderive a class of acyclic tournaments (representing plausible causal orders)\nthat maximizes a consistency score derived from an LLM. Our approach begins by\ncomputing pairwise consistency scores between variables, yielding a\nsemi-complete directed graph that aggregates these scores. From this structure,\nwe identify optimal acyclic tournaments, prioritizing those that maximize\nconsistency across all configurations.

The current early detection models perform \"black\nbox\" inference suffering from limited explainability and trust which blocks the\nreal-world clinical application. Thanks to the generative properties introduced\nby the Large Language Models (LLMs), the decision and the prediction from such\nmodels are semi-interpretable through the corresponding description. However,\nthe existing LLMs are mostly trained for general purposes without the guidance\nof psychological cognitive theory. To this end, we first highlight the\nimportance of prior theory with the observation of performance boosted by the\nchain-of-thoughts tailored for stress detection. This method termed Cognition\nChain explicates the generation of stress through a step-by-step cognitive\nperspective based on cognitive appraisal theory with a progress pipeline:\nStimulus $\\rightarrow$ Evaluation $\\rightarrow$ Reaction $\\rightarrow$ Stress\nState, guiding LLMs to provide comprehensive reasoning explanations. We further\nstudy the benefits brought by the proposed Cognition Chain format by utilising\nit as a synthetic dataset generation template for LLMs instruction-tuning and\nintroduce CogInstruct, an instruction-tuning dataset for stress detection. This\ndataset is developed using a three-stage self-reflective annotation pipeline\nthat enables LLMs to autonomously generate and refine instructional data. By\ninstruction-tuning Llama3 with CogInstruct, we develop CogLLM, an explainable\nstress detection model.

To address the inefficiency, model\nmerging strategies have emerged, merging all LLMs into one model to reduce the\nmemory footprint during inference. Despite these advances, model merging often\nleads to parameter conflicts and performance decline as the number of experts\nincreases.

Among algorithms for planning and learning in CMDPs, methods based\non Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) have particular importance due to their\nefficiency and extendibility to more complex frameworks (such as partially\nobservable settings and games). However, current MCTS-based methods for CMDPs\neither struggle with finding safe (i.e., constraint-satisfying) policies, or\nare too conservative and do not find valuable policies. We introduce Threshold\nUCT (T-UCT), an online MCTS-based algorithm for CMDP planning. Unlike previous\nMCTS-based CMDP planners, T-UCT explicitly estimates Pareto curves of\ncost-utility trade-offs throughout the search tree, using these together with a\nnovel action selection and threshold update rules to seek safe and valuable\npolicies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods from the literature.",

In this work we systematically investigate how\nspecific attributes of preference datasets affect the alignment and downstream\nperformance of LLMs in instruction-following tasks. We use a novel synthetic\ndata generation pipeline to generate 48,000 unique instruction-following\nprompts with combinations of 23 verifiable constraints that enable fine-grained\nand automated quality assessments of model responses. With our synthetic\nprompts, we use two preference dataset curation methods - rejection sampling\n(RS) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - to obtain pairs of (chosen, rejected)\nresponses. Then, we perform experiments investigating the effects of (1) the\npresence of shared prefixes between the chosen and rejected responses, (2) the\ncontrast and quality of the chosen, rejected responses and (3) the complexity\nof the training prompts. Our experiments reveal that shared prefixes in\npreference pairs, as generated by MCTS, provide marginal but consistent\nimprovements and greater stability across challenging training configurations.\nHigh-contrast preference pairs generally outperform low-contrast pairs;\nhowever, combining both often yields the best performance by balancing\ndiversity and learning efficiency. Additionally, training on prompts of\nmoderate difficulty leads to better generalization across tasks, even for more\ncomplex evaluation scenarios, compared to overly challenging prompts.

      "abstract": "Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of\nintelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate\nurban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods\nhave demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods are\nstill prone to making unreasonable policies. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nnovel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive\nPressure for multi-intersection signal control (BCT-APLight). In BCT-APLight,\nthe Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to\nrefine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian\ninference-based Critique Layer provides effective evaluations of the\ncredibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer fine-tunes\npolicies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative.\nMeanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to\neffectively weight the vehicle queues in each lane, thereby enhancing the\nrationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Equipped\nwith the CT framework and AP mechanism, BCT-APLight effectively enhances the\nreasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator\nacross a range of intersection layouts demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior\nto other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on seven real-world datasets.\nSpecifically, BCT-APLight decreases average queue length by\n\\textbf{\\(\\boldsymbol{9.60\\%}\\)} and average waiting time by\n\\textbf{\\(\\boldsymbol{15.28\\%}\\)}.",

This research investigates how knowledge\ntransfer across languages can enhance MNMT in such scenarios. Using the Tatoeba\ntranslation challenge dataset from Helsinki NLP, we perform English-German,\nEnglish-French, and English-Spanish translations, leveraging minimal parallel\ndata to establish cross-lingual mappings. Unlike conventional methods relying\non extensive pre-training for specific language pairs, we pre-train our model\non English-English translations, setting English as the source language for all\ntasks. The model is fine-tuned on target language pairs using joint multi-task\nand sequential transfer learning strategies. Our work addresses three key\nquestions: (1) How can knowledge transfer across languages improve MNMT in\nextremely low-resource scenarios? (2) How does pruning neuron knowledge affect\nmodel generalization, robustness, and catastrophic forgetting? (3) How can\nTX-Ray interpret and quantify knowledge transfer in trained models? Evaluation\nusing BLEU-4 scores demonstrates that sequential transfer learning outperforms\nbaselines on a 40k parallel sentence corpus, showcasing its efficacy.

Recent work devised examples of machine learning (ML) classifiers for\nwhich the computed SHAP scores are thoroughly unsatisfactory, by allowing human\ndecision-makers to be misled. Nevertheless, such examples could be perceived as\nsomewhat artificial, since the selected classes must be interpreted as numeric.\nFurthermore, it was unclear how general were the issues identified with SHAP\nscores. This paper answers these criticisms. First, the paper shows that for\nBoolean classifiers there are arbitrarily many examples for which the SHAP\nscores must be deemed unsatisfactory. Second, the paper shows that the issues\nwith SHAP scores are also observed in the case of regression models. In\naddition, the paper studies the class of regression models that respect\nLipschitz continuity, a measure of a function's rate of change that finds\nimportant recent uses in ML, including model robustness. Concretely, the paper\nshows that the issues with SHAP scores occur even for regression models that\nrespect Lipschitz continuity. Finally, the paper shows that the same issues are\nguaranteed to exist for arbitrarily differentiable regression models.",

The\nresulting integrated demand management and vehicle routing problems (i-DMVRPs)\ncan be formulated as Markov decision process models and, theoretically, can be\nsolved via the well-known Bellman equation.

Thus, in the literature, i-DMVRPs\nare often addressed via decomposition-based solution approaches involving an\nopportunity cost approximation as a key component.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision\napplications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video\nsummarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial\ncomplexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual\ndata. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on\npretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders\nto capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM\nframeworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However,\nthe critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time,\nand how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos?\nThis work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a\nspecific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key\nlimitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing\ngaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal\nconcepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze\nchallenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal\nannotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal\nunderstanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future\ndirections, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of\nenriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures\nfor integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these\nchallenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking\ntheir full potential in video analysis and beyond.

      "abstract": "For modern recommender systems, the use of low-dimensional latent\nrepresentations to embed users and items based on their observed interactions\nhas become commonplace. However, many existing recommendation models are\nprimarily designed for coarse-grained and homogeneous interactions, which\nlimits their effectiveness in two critical dimensions. Firstly, these models\nfail to leverage the relational dependencies that exist across different types\nof user behaviors, such as page views, collects, comments, and purchases.\nSecondly, they struggle to capture the fine-grained latent factors that drive\nuser interaction patterns. To address these limitations, we present a\nheterogeneous graph collaborative filtering model MixRec that excels at\ndisentangling users' multi-behavior interaction patterns and uncovering the\nlatent intent factors behind each behavior. Our model achieves this by\nincorporating intent disentanglement and multi-behavior modeling, facilitated\nby a parameterized heterogeneous hypergraph architecture. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a novel contrastive learning paradigm that adaptively explores the\nadvantages of self-supervised data augmentation, thereby enhancing the model's\nresilience against data sparsity and expressiveness with relation\nheterogeneity. To validate the efficacy of MixRec, we conducted extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets. The results clearly demonstrate its\nsuperior performance, significantly outperforming various state-of-the-art\nbaselines. Our model is open-sourced and available at:\nhttps://github.com/HKUDS/MixRec.",

The appearance and state of objects frequently undergo complex\ntransformations depending on the object properties, e.g., phase transitions.\nHowever, in the vision community, segmenting dynamic objects with phase\ntransitions is overlooked. In light of this, we introduce the concept of phase\nin segmentation, which categorizes real-world objects based on their visual\ncharacteristics and potential morphological and appearance changes. Then, we\npresent a new benchmark, Multi-Phase, Multi-Transition, and Multi-Scenery Video\nObject Segmentation (M$^3$-VOS), to verify the ability of models to understand\nobject phases, which consists of 479 high-resolution videos spanning over 10\ndistinct everyday scenarios. It provides dense instance mask annotations that\ncapture both object phases and their transitions. We evaluate state-of-the-art\nmethods on M$^3$-VOS, yielding several key insights. Notably, current\nappearancebased approaches show significant room for improvement when handling\nobjects with phase transitions. The inherent changes in disorder suggest that\nthe predictive performance of the forward entropy-increasing process can be\nimproved through a reverse entropy-reducing process.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent\nfindings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be\npruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an\nopportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall\nrooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We\ndemonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads\nto diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their\neffectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger\ngradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier\nlayers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique\nthat combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN\napplies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring\nmore uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the\nnetwork--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training.\nExtensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that\nMix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more\nbalanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the\noverall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models\npre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN\nduring supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep\nlayers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current\nLLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without\nincreasing model size.

Integrating multimodal features further\nenhances this performance, capturing complementary patterns across text and\nimages. While text remains the dominant modality, visual data adds stylistic\ncues that enrich model performance. Moreover, text-image alignment strategies\nlike CLIP and BLIP2 struggle due to low semantic overlap and vague connections\nbetween the modalities of escort ads, with end-to-end multimodal training\nproving more robust.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited outstanding performance in\nnatural language processing tasks. However, these models remain susceptible to\nadversarial attacks in which slight input perturbations can lead to harmful or\nmisleading outputs. A gradient-based defensive suffix generation algorithm is\ndesigned to bolster the robustness of LLMs. By appending carefully optimized\ndefensive suffixes to input prompts, the algorithm mitigates adversarial\ninfluences while preserving the models' utility. To enhance adversarial\nunderstanding, a novel total loss function ($L_{\\text{total}}$) combining\ndefensive loss ($L_{\\text{def}}$) and adversarial loss ($L_{\\text{adv}}$)\ngenerates defensive suffixes more effectively. Experimental evaluations\nconducted on open-source LLMs such as Gemma-7B, mistral-7B, Llama2-7B, and\nLlama2-13B show that the proposed method reduces attack success rates (ASR) by\nan average of 11\\% compared to models without defensive suffixes. Additionally,\nthe perplexity score of Gemma-7B decreased from 6.57 to 3.93 when applying the\ndefensive suffix generated by openELM-270M. Furthermore, TruthfulQA evaluations\ndemonstrate consistent improvements with Truthfulness scores increasing by up\nto 10\\% across tested configurations. This approach significantly enhances the\nsecurity of LLMs in critical applications without requiring extensive\nretraining.",

      "abstract": "The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate\nhigh-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts rises\nmany concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can\nbe effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following\npredefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various\naspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a\ncombination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not\nbeen comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger\nintegrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this\ngap by evaluation of vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their\nwillingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English.\nWe further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the\npersonalization quality and whether the personalization affects the\ngenerated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger\nsafety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most\nof the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the\npersonalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus\neffectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently\naddressed by LLM developers and service providers.",

Advanced Language Model-based metrics also\nstruggle with aligning to nuanced human preferences.

Extensive results show that G-VEval outperforms existing\nmethods in correlation with human annotations, as measured by Kendall tau-b and\nKendall tau-c. This provides a flexible solution for diverse captioning tasks\nand suggests a straightforward yet effective approach for large language models\nto understand video content, paving the way for advancements in automated\ncaptioning.

There are multiple levels of novel\ncompositions including phrase-phrase level, phrase-word level, and word-word\nlevel. Existing methods achieve promising compositional generalization, but the\nconsistency of compositional generalization across multiple levels of novel\ncompositions remains unexplored. The consistency refers to that a model should\ngeneralize to a phrase-phrase level novel composition, and\nphrase-word/word-word level novel compositions that can be derived from it\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning based framework, for\nachieving consistent compositional generalization across multiple levels. The\nbasic idea is to progressively learn compositions from simple to complex for\nconsistency. Specifically, we divide the original training set into multiple\nvalidation sets based on compositional complexity, and introduce multiple\nmeta-weight-nets to generate sample weights for samples in different validation\nsets. To fit the validation sets in order of increasing compositional\ncomplexity, we optimize the parameters of each meta-weight-net independently\nand sequentially in a multilevel optimization manner.

      "abstract": "Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities in LLMs have recently become a central\nobject of investigation. Cognitive science distinguishes between two steps\nrequired for ToM tasks: 1) determine whether to invoke ToM, which includes the\nappropriate Depth of Mentalizing (DoM), or level of recursion required to\ncomplete a task; and 2) applying the correct inference given the DoM. In this\nposition paper, we first identify several lines of work in different\ncommunities in AI, including LLM benchmarking, ToM add-ons, ToM probing, and\nformal models for ToM. We argue that recent work in AI tends to focus\nexclusively on the second step which are typically framed as static logic\nproblems. We conclude with suggestions for improved evaluation of ToM\ncapabilities inspired by dynamic environments used in cognitive tasks.",

These\nexplanations have different properties, which in turn has led to the problem of\nmethod selection: which explanation method is most suitable for a given use\ncase? In this work, we propose a unifying framework of attribution-based\nexplanation methods, which provides a step towards a rigorous study of the\nsimilarities and differences of explanations. We first introduce removal-based\nattribution methods (RBAMs), and show that an extensively broad selection of\nexisting methods can be viewed as such RBAMs. We then introduce the canonical\nadditive decomposition (CAD). This is a general construction for additively\ndecomposing any function based on the central idea of removing (groups of)\nfeatures. We proceed to show that indeed every valid additive decomposition is\nan instance of the CAD, and that any removal-based attribution method is\nassociated with a specific CAD. Next, we show that any removal-based\nattribution method can be completely defined as a game-theoretic value or\ninteraction index for a specific (possibly constant-shifted) cooperative game,\nwhich is defined using the corresponding CAD of the method. We then use this\nintrinsic connection to define formal descriptions of specific behaviours of\nexplanation methods, which we also call functional axioms, and identify\nsufficient conditions on the corresponding CAD and game-theoretic value or\ninteraction index of an attribution method under which the attribution method\nis guaranteed to adhere to these functional axioms.

In real-world deployment, a crucial aspect of\nHAR that has been largely overlooked is that the test sets may have different\ndistributions from training sets due to inter-subject variability including\nage, gender, behavioral habits, etc., which leads to poor generalization\nperformance. One promising solution is to learn domain-invariant\nrepresentations to enable a model to generalize on an unseen distribution.\nHowever, most existing methods only consider the feature-invariance of the\npenultimate layer for domain-invariant learning, which leads to suboptimal\nresults.

Most existing work on DFL\nfocuses on supervised learning, assuming each client possesses sufficient\nlabeled data for local training. However, in real-world applications, much of\nthe data is unlabeled. We address this by considering a challenging yet\npractical semisupervised learning (SSL) scenario in DFL, where clients may have\nvarying data sources: some with few labeled samples, some with purely unlabeled\ndata, and others with both. In this work, we propose SemiDFL, the first\nsemi-supervised DFL method that enhances DFL performance in SSL scenarios by\nestablishing a consensus in both data and model spaces. Specifically, we\nutilize neighborhood information to improve the quality of pseudo-labeling,\nwhich is crucial for effectively leveraging unlabeled data. We then design a\nconsensusbased diffusion model to generate synthesized data, which is used in\ncombination with pseudo-labeled data to create mixed datasets. Additionally, we\ndevelop an adaptive aggregation method that leverages the model accuracy of\nsynthesized data to further enhance SemiDFL performance.

      "abstract": "The recent rise of semantic-style communications includes the development of\ngoal-oriented communications (GOCOMs) remarkably efficient multimedia\ninformation transmissions. The concept of GO-COMS leverages advanced artificial\nintelligence (AI) tools to address the rising demand for bandwidth efficiency\nin applications, such as edge computing and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Unlike\ntraditional communication systems focusing on source data accuracy, GO-COMs\nprovide intelligent message delivery catering to the special needs critical to\naccomplishing downstream tasks at the receiver. In this work, we present a\nnovel GO-COM framework, namely LaMI-GO that utilizes emerging generative AI for\nbetter quality-of-service (QoS) with ultra-high communication efficiency.\nSpecifically, we design our LaMI-GO system backbone based on a latent diffusion\nmodel followed by a vector-quantized generative adversarial network (VQGAN) for\nefficient latent embedding and information representation. The system trains a\ncommon feature codebook the receiver side. Our experimental results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvement in perceptual quality, accuracy of downstream tasks,\nand bandwidth consumption over the state-of-the-art GOCOM systems and establish\nthe power of our proposed LaMI-GO communication framework.",

      "abstract": "Video has emerged as a favored multimedia format on the internet. To better\ngain video contents, a new topic HIREST is presented, including video\nretrieval, moment retrieval, moment segmentation, and step-captioning. The\npioneering work chooses the pre-trained CLIP-based model for video retrieval,\nand leverages it as a feature extractor for other three challenging tasks\nsolved in a multi-task learning paradigm. Nevertheless, this work struggles to\nlearn the comprehensive cognition of user-preferred content, due to\ndisregarding the hierarchies and association relations across modalities. In\nthis paper, guided by the shallow-to-deep principle, we propose a query-centric\naudio-visual cognition (QUAG) network to construct a reliable multi-modal\nrepresentation for moment retrieval, segmentation and step-captioning.\nSpecifically, we first design the modality-synergistic perception to obtain\nrich audio-visual content, by modeling global contrastive alignment and local\nfine-grained interaction between visual and audio modalities. Then, we devise\nthe query-centric cognition that uses the deep-level query to perform the\ntemporal-channel filtration on the shallow-level audio-visual representation.\nThis can cognize user-preferred content and thus attain a query-centric\naudio-visual representation for three tasks. Extensive experiments show QUAG\nachieves the SOTA results on HIREST. Further, we test QUAG on the query-based\nvideo summarization task and verify its good generalization.",

      "abstract": "High-dimensional data visualization is crucial in the big data era and these\ntechniques such as t-SNE and UMAP have been widely used in science and\nengineering. Big data, however, is often distributed across multiple data\ncenters and subject to security and privacy concerns, which leads to\ndifficulties for the standard algorithms of t-SNE and UMAP. To tackle the\nchallenge, this work proposes Fed-tSNE and Fed-UMAP, which provide\nhigh-dimensional data visualization under the framework of federated learning,\nwithout exchanging data across clients or sending data to the central server.\nThe main idea of Fed-tSNE and Fed-UMAP is implicitly learning the distribution\ninformation of data in a manner of federated learning and then estimating the\nglobal distance matrix for t-SNE and UMAP. To further enhance the protection of\ndata privacy, we propose Fed-tSNE+ and Fed-UMAP+. We also extend our idea to\nfederated spectral clustering, yielding algorithms of clustering distributed\ndata. In addition to these new algorithms, we offer theoretical guarantees of\noptimization convergence, distance and similarity estimation, and differential\nprivacy. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that, compared to the\noriginal algorithms, the accuracy drops of our federated algorithms are tiny.",

      "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated promising performance across various\nsoftware engineering tasks. While fine-tuning is a common practice to adapt\nthese models for downstream tasks, it becomes challenging in\nresource-constrained environments due to increased memory requirements from\ngrowing trainable parameters in increasingly large language models. We\nintroduce \\approach, a technique to adapt large models for downstream code\ntasks using Code Property Graphs (CPGs). Our approach introduces a modular\ncomponent called \\transducer that enriches code embeddings with structural and\ndependency information from CPGs. The Transducer comprises two key components:\nGraph Vectorization Engine (GVE) and Attention-Based Fusion Layer (ABFL). GVE\nextracts CPGs from input source code and transforms them into graph feature\nvectors. ABFL then fuses those graphs feature vectors with initial code\nembeddings from a large language model. By optimizing these transducers for\ndifferent downstream tasks, our approach enhances the models without the need\nto fine-tune them for specific tasks. We have evaluated \\approach on three\ndownstream tasks: code summarization, assert generation, and code translation.\nOur results demonstrate competitive performance compared to full parameter\nfine-tuning while reducing up to 99\\% trainable parameters to save memory.\n\\approach also remains competitive against other fine-tuning approaches (e.g.,\nLoRA, Prompt-Tuning, Prefix-Tuning) while using only 1.5\\%-80\\% of their\ntrainable parameters. Our findings show that integrating structural and\ndependency information through Transducer Tuning enables more efficient model\nadaptation, making it easier for users to adapt large models in\nresource-constrained settings.",

      "abstract": "Pre-trained Vision-Language (VL) models such as CLIP have demonstrated their\nexcellent performance across numerous downstream tasks. A recent method,\nContext Optimization (CoOp), further improves the performance of VL models on\ndownstream tasks by introducing prompt learning. CoOp optimizes a set of\nlearnable vectors, aka prompt, and freezes the whole CLIP model. However,\nrelying solely on CLIP loss to fine-tune prompts can lead to models that are\nprone to overfitting on downstream task. To address this issue, we propose a\nplug-in prompt-regularization method called PLPP (Prompt Learning with\nPerPlexity), which use perplexity loss to regularize prompt learning. PLPP\ndesigns a two-step operation to compute the perplexity for prompts: (a)\ncalculating cosine similarity between the weight of the embedding layer and\nprompts to get labels, (b) introducing a language model (LM) head that requires\nno training behind text encoder to output word probability distribution.\nMeanwhile, we unveil that the essence of PLPP is inherently a form of\nself-distillation. To further prevent overfitting as well as to reduce the\nadditional computation introduced by PLPP, we turn the hard label to soft label\nand choose top-$k$ values for calculating the perplexity loss. For accelerating\nmodel convergence, we introduce mutual self-distillation learning, that is\nperplexity and inverted perplexity loss. The experiments conducted on four\nclassification tasks indicate that PLPP exhibits superior performance compared\nto existing methods.",

The adversary can only access the target model's\npredictions for generated samples. Once the substitute model closely\napproximates the behavior of the target model, attackers can exploit its\nwhite-box characteristics for subsequent malicious activities, such as\nadversarial attacks. Existing methods within cooperative game frameworks often\nproduce samples with high confidence for the prediction of the substitute\nmodel, which makes it difficult for the substitute model to replicate the\nbehavior of the target model. This paper presents a new data-free model\nstealing approach called Query Efficient Data Generation (\\textbf{QEDG}). We\nintroduce two distinct loss functions to ensure the generation of sufficient\nsamples that closely and uniformly align with the target model's decision\nboundary across multiple classes. Building on the limitation of current\nmethods, which typically yield only one piece of supervised information per\nquery, we propose the query-free sample augmentation that enables the\nacquisition of additional supervised information without increasing the number\nof queries. Motivated by theoretical analysis, we adopt the consistency rate\nmetric, which more accurately evaluates the similarity between the substitute\nand target models.

However, due to the noise and\nsparsity of LiDAR-captured point clouds, robust human pose estimation remains\nchallenging. Most of the existing methods use temporal information, multi-modal\nfusion, or SMPL optimization to correct biased results. In this work, we try to\nobtain sufficient information for 3D HPE only by modeling the intrinsic\nproperties of low-quality point clouds. Hence, a simple yet powerful method is\nproposed, which provides insights both on modeling and augmentation of point\nclouds. Specifically, we first propose a concise and effective density-aware\npose transformer (DAPT) to get stable keypoint representations. By using a set\nof joint anchors and a carefully designed exchange module, valid information is\nextracted from point clouds with different densities. Then 1D heatmaps are\nutilized to represent the precise locations of the keypoints. Secondly, a\ncomprehensive LiDAR human synthesis and augmentation method is proposed to\npre-train the model, enabling it to acquire a better human body prior. We\nincrease the diversity of point clouds by randomly sampling human positions and\norientations and by simulating occlusions through the addition of laser-level\nmasks.

Absolute Pose\nRegression (APR) trains a scene-dependent model to efficiently map an input\nimage to the camera pose in a pre-defined scene. However, many applications\nhave continually changing environments, where inference data at novel poses or\nscene conditions (weather, geometry) appear after deployment. Training APR on a\nfixed dataset leads to overfitting, making it fail catastrophically on\nchallenging novel data. This work proposes Continual Domain Expansion (ConDo),\nwhich continually collects unlabeled inference data to update the deployed APR.\nInstead of applying standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods which are\nineffective for APR, ConDo effectively learns from unlabeled data by distilling\nknowledge from scene-agnostic localization methods. By sampling data uniformly\nfrom historical and newly collected data, ConDo can effectively expand the\ngeneralization domain of APR. Large-scale benchmarks with various scene types\nare constructed to evaluate models under practical (long-term) data changes.\nConDo consistently and significantly outperforms baselines across\narchitectures, scene types, and data changes. On challenging scenes (Fig.1), it\nreduces the localization error by >7x (14.8m vs 1.7m). Analysis shows the\nrobustness of ConDo against compute budgets, replay buffer sizes and teacher\nprediction noise. Comparing to model re-training, ConDo achieves similar\nperformance up to 25x faster.",

      "abstract": "Federated graph learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for enabling\nheterogeneous clients to process their private graph data locally while\ninteracting with a centralized server, thus maintaining privacy. However, graph\ndata on clients are typically non-IID, posing a challenge for a single model to\nperform well across all clients. Another major bottleneck of FGL is the high\ncost of communication. To address these challenges, we propose a\ncommunication-efficient personalized federated graph learning algorithm, CEFGL.\nOur method decomposes the model parameters into low-rank generic and sparse\nprivate models. We employ a dual-channel encoder to learn sparse local\nknowledge in a personalized manner and low-rank global knowledge in a shared\nmanner. Additionally, we perform multiple local stochastic gradient descent\niterations between communication phases and integrate efficient compression\ntechniques into the algorithm. The advantage of CEFGL lies in its ability to\ncapture common and individual knowledge more precisely. By utilizing low-rank\nand sparse parameters along with compression techniques, CEFGL significantly\nreduces communication complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves optimal classification accuracy in a variety of heterogeneous\nenvironments across sixteen datasets. Specifically, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art method FedStar, the proposed method (with GIN as the base\nmodel) improves accuracy by 5.64\\% on cross-datasets setting CHEM, reduces\ncommunication bits by a factor of 18.58, and reduces the communication time by\na factor of 1.65.",

Although previous typical\nmethods have achieved commendable results, it is still challenging to retrieve\nshort video moments. This is primarily due to the reliance on sparse and\nlimited decoder queries, which significantly constrain the accuracy of\npredictions. Furthermore, suboptimal outcomes often arise because previous\nmethods rank predictions based on isolated predictions, neglecting the broader\nvideo context. To tackle these issues, we introduce FlashVTG, a framework\nfeaturing a Temporal Feature Layering (TFL) module and an Adaptive Score\nRefinement (ASR) module. The TFL module replaces the traditional decoder\nstructure to capture nuanced video content variations across multiple temporal\nscales, while the ASR module improves prediction ranking by integrating context\nfrom adjacent moments and multi-temporal-scale features. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FlashVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely\nadopted datasets in both MR and HD. Specifically, on the QVHighlights dataset,\nit boosts mAP by 5.8% for MR and 3.3% for HD. For short-moment retrieval,\nFlashVTG increases mAP to 125% of previous SOTA performance.

      "abstract": "Inductive reasoning - the process of inferring general rules from a small\nnumber of observations - is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Recent\nworks suggest that large language models (LLMs) can engage in inductive\nreasoning by sampling multiple hypotheses about the rules and selecting the one\nthat best explains the observations. However, due to the IID sampling,\nsemantically redundant hypotheses are frequently generated, leading to\nsignificant wastage of compute. In this paper, we 1) demonstrate that\nincreasing the temperature to enhance the diversity is limited due to text\ndegeneration issue, and 2) propose a novel method to improve the diversity\nwhile maintaining text quality. We first analyze the effect of increasing the\ntemperature parameter, which is regarded as the LLM's diversity control, on IID\nhypotheses. Our analysis shows that as temperature rises, diversity and\naccuracy of hypotheses increase up to a certain point, but this trend saturates\ndue to text degeneration. To generate hypotheses that are more semantically\ndiverse and of higher quality, we propose a novel approach inspired by human\ninductive reasoning, which we call Mixture of Concepts (MoC). When applied to\nseveral inductive reasoning benchmarks, MoC demonstrated significant\nperformance improvements compared to standard IID sampling and other\napproaches.",

While adversarial\nvulnerabilities in 2D vision models have been extensively studied, the threat\nlandscape for 3D generative models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF),\nremains underexplored. This work introduces \\textit{AdvIRL}, a novel framework\nfor crafting adversarial NeRF models using Instant Neural Graphics Primitives\n(Instant-NGP) and Reinforcement Learning. Unlike prior methods, \\textit{AdvIRL}\ngenerates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D\ntransformations, including rotations and scaling, enabling effective black-box\nattacks in real-world scenarios. Our approach is validated across a wide range\nof scenes, from small objects (e.g., bananas) to large environments (e.g.,\nlighthouses). Notably, targeted attacks achieved high-confidence\nmisclassifications, such as labeling a banana as a slug and a truck as a\ncannon, demonstrating the practical risks posed by adversarial NeRFs. Beyond\nattacking, \\textit{AdvIRL}-generated adversarial models can serve as\nadversarial training data to enhance the robustness of vision systems.

We analyze key\nelements of human-horse relationships: trust, communication, and mutual\nadaptability, to highlight essential principles for human-AI collaboration.\nTrust is critical in both partnerships, built through predictability and shared\nunderstanding, while communication and feedback loops foster mutual\nadaptability. We further discuss the importance of taming and habituation in\nshaping these interactions, likening it to how humans train AI to perform\nreliably and ethically in real-world settings. The article also addresses the\nasymmetry of responsibility, where humans ultimately bear the greater burden of\noversight and ethical judgment. Finally, we emphasize that long-term commitment\nand continuous learning are vital in both human-horse and human-AI\nrelationships, as ongoing interaction refines the partnership and increases\nmutual adaptability.

Traditional\ndiscriminative methods, which learn a deterministic mapping from a 2D image to\na single 3D mesh, often struggle with the inherent ambiguities in 2D-to-3D\nmapping. To address this challenge, we propose MaskHand, a novel generative\nmasked model for hand mesh recovery that synthesizes plausible 3D hand meshes\nby learning and sampling from the probabilistic distribution of the ambiguous\n2D-to-3D mapping process. MaskHand consists of two key components: (1) a\nVQ-MANO, which encodes 3D hand articulations as discrete pose tokens in a\nlatent space, and (2) a Context-Guided Masked Transformer that randomly masks\nout pose tokens and learns their joint distribution, conditioned on corrupted\ntoken sequence, image context, and 2D pose cues. This learned distribution\nfacilitates confidence-guided sampling during inference, producing mesh\nreconstructions with low uncertainty and high precision. Extensive evaluations\non benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that MaskHand achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and realism in 3D hand mesh\nreconstruction.

    "abstract": "We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups.

    "abstract": "Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of 3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding. However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the \"Safety Tax\". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs--with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning--without compromising their reasoning abilities. Our ablation studies further identify three key factors in LoRA: (1) rank-$1$ updates are sufficient to achieve the best reasoning and safety performance, (2) the up projection layers are the most critical modules, with LoRA applied to them alone achieving even better results, and (3) middle layers are more effective than early or late layers. Together, these findings show that strong safety and reasoning can be achieved at minimal computational cost when updates are applied in the right places. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. Finally, while our attempts to further reduce this overlap yield only modest improvements on some tasks, they highlight the potential of developing methods that more reliably optimize the reasoning-safety tradeoff.",

However, a critical question remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213% increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82% decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all standalone defense strategies.",

We consider four different objectives, where each client $i\\in C$ attempts to minimize either the sum or the maximum of its distance to the chosen facilities, and where the overall objective either considers the sum or the maximum of the individual client costs. Rather than optimizing a single objective at a time, we study how compatible these objectives are with each other, and show the existence of solutions which are simultaneously close-to-optimum for any pair of the above objectives. Our results show that when choosing a set of facilities or a representative committee, it is often possible to form a solution which is good for several objectives at the same time, instead of sacrificing one desideratum to achieve another.",

The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains. Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives to those obtained via offline RL.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we try to answer the question \"What constitutes Sudoku difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?\" Using two distinct methods that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites, the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of collision-free paths, one for each agent in a shared environment. Its objective is to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent is defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location. Explicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for bounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a user-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and a lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of paths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve collisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its optimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually bounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower bound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up EECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though EECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution, increasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS to switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a particular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion to the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy constraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we propose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical framework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is complete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches outperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.",

    "abstract": "Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting devices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential quantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses significant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds. Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.",

Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream application such as animation, toonify, and relighting.

    "abstract": "Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations (barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.",

The key objective is to convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model. The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the complex dynamics underlying the original time series.

    "abstract": "Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the \"better\" response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many, but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved (non-saturated) annotator benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Interest in sustainability information has surged in recent years. However, the data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and processes from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts (EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing multimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and stakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the cradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI agents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom data abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text and images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach reduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data availability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of expert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to directly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with similar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop with a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven method to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown material to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar materials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry, this improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this approach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows.",

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers without the need for retraining the generator.",

The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with a small number of queries.

Prior approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular, interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for static malware detection using the EMBER dataset, which contains feature representations of Portable Executable (PE) files. We evaluate eight classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost, show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features in the EMBER dataset. The results suggest that boosting models remain the most reliable choice for high-dimensional static malware detection, and that dimensionality reduction should be applied selectively based on model type. This work provides a benchmark for comparing classification models and preprocessing strategies in malware detection tasks and contributes insights that can guide future system development and real-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.",

However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), they suffer from data leakage, limited scope, and superficial analysis, hindering the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper begins by revisiting the common issues in existing research on PLMs for VD through the evaluation pipeline. It then proceeds with an accurate and extensive evaluation of 18 PLMs on high-quality datasets that feature accurate labeling, diverse vulnerability types, and various projects. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness to a series of perturbations.\n  Our findings reveal that PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible number of labeling errors, which is overlooked by previous work. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications.",

Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy.

    "abstract": "Register Transfer Level(RTL) code optimization is crucial for achieving high performance and low power consumption in digital circuit design. However, traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions, potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings. (1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL code optimization.",

    "abstract": "When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to generate natural language \"reasoning chains\", their performance improves on a variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate incorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction. We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning models.",

While recent deep learning models have shown promise in predicting translational efficiency from 5'UTR sequences, most are constrained by fixed input lengths and limited interpretability. We introduce UTR-STCNet, a Transformer-based architecture for flexible and biologically grounded modeling of variable-length 5'UTRs. UTR-STCNet integrates a Saliency-Aware Token Clustering (SATC) module that iteratively aggregates nucleotide tokens into multi-scale, semantically meaningful units based on saliency scores. A Saliency-Guided Transformer (SGT) block then captures both local and distal regulatory dependencies using a lightweight attention mechanism. This combined architecture achieves efficient and interpretable modeling without input truncation or increased computational cost. Evaluated across three benchmark datasets, UTR-STCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predicting mean ribosome load (MRL), a key proxy for translational efficiency. Moreover, the model recovers known functional elements such as upstream AUGs and Kozak motifs, highlighting its potential for mechanistic insight into translation regulation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient, economically efficient energy communities.",

Standard approaches to this problem rely on modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall, CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without modifying training data.",

    "abstract": "While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs), their implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate the development of robust dialogue systems.",

We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.",

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However, designing effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design choices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java and Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore various RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their effectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically, we (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants to answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new questions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the similarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding partially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find that implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding (HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering similarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG pipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot performance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline consistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher scores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These findings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer quality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen and novel questions across different LLMs",

    "abstract": "Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art performance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative sampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or one-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps noise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by enforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous velocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a limiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first principles of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite integrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term Interval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential relationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals without resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we introduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic consistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the differential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit of our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This establishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning average velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is significantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations, resulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware compatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been successfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as Doubao), achieving speedups of 20x.",

    "abstract": "Asthma-related deaths in the UK are the highest in Europe, and only 30% of patients access basic care. There is a need for alternative approaches to reaching people with asthma in order to provide health education, self-management support and bridges to care. Automated conversational agents (specifically, mobile chatbots) present opportunities for providing alternative and individually tailored access to health education, self-management support and risk self-assessment. But would patients engage with a chatbot, and what factors influence engagement? We present results from a patient survey (N=1257) devised by a team of asthma clinicians, patients, and technology developers, conducted to identify optimal factors for efficacy, value and engagement for a chatbot. Results indicate that most adults with asthma (53%) are interested in using a chatbot and the patients most likely to do so are those who believe their asthma is more serious and who are less confident about self-management. Results also indicate enthusiasm for 24/7 access, personalisation, and for WhatsApp as the preferred access method (compared to app, voice assistant, SMS or website). Obstacles to uptake include security/privacy concerns and skepticism of technological capabilities. We present detailed findings and consolidate these into 7 recommendations for developers for optimising efficacy of chatbot-based health support.",

    "abstract": "Agentic search, as a more autonomous and adaptive paradigm of retrieval augmentation, is driving the evolution of intelligent search systems. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic search. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often deviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to introduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations, leading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current frameworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the evaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search. To address these limitations, we propose RAVine -- a Reality-Aligned eValuation framework for agentic LLMs with search. RAVine targets multi-point queries and long-form answers that better reflect user intents, and introduces an attributable ground truth construction strategy to enhance the accuracy of fine-grained evaluation. Moreover, RAVine examines model's interaction with search tools throughout the iterative process, and accounts for factors of efficiency. We benchmark a series of models using RAVine and derive several insights, which we hope will contribute to advancing the development of agentic search systems.

However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge.

In ExpTeach, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of ExpTeach.",

    "abstract": "Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees, achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree. Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2 system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.",

However, the randomness of Gaussian noise distorts point-based distance measurements in classification tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose a confidence optimization probabilistic encoding (CPE) method that improves distance reliability and enhances representation learning. Specifically, we refine probabilistic encoding with two key strategies: First, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism to adjust distance calculations, ensuring consistency and reliability in probabilistic encoding classification tasks. Second, we replace the conventional KL divergence-based variance regularization, which relies on unreliable prior assumptions, with a simpler L2 regularization term to directly constrain variance. The method we proposed is model-agnostic, and extensive experiments on natural language classification tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and generalization on both the BERT and the RoBERTa model.",

Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models, FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on https://github.com/jianganbai/FISHER",

In contrast to standard regression models that require a prescribed functional form, SR constructs expressions from a user-defined set of mathematical primitives, enabling the automated discovery of compact formulas that fit the data and reveal underlying physical relationships. In fluid mechanics, where understanding the underlying physics is as crucial as predictive accuracy, this study applies SR to model three-dimensional (3D) laminar flow in a rectangular channel, focusing on the axial velocity and pressure fields. Compact symbolic equations were derived from numerical simulation data, accurately reproducing the expected parabolic velocity profile and linear pressure drop, and showing excellent agreement with analytical solutions from the literature. To address the limitation that purely data-driven SR models may overlook domain-specific constraints, an innovative hybrid framework that integrates SR with Answer Set Programming (ASP) is also introduced. This integration combines the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning capabilities of ASP, ensuring that derived equations remain both statistically accurate and physically plausible. The proposed SR/ASP methodology demonstrates the potential of combining data-driven and knowledge-representation approaches to enhance interpretability, reliability, and alignment with physical principles in fluid dynamics and related domains.",

    "abstract": "In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment (ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs. tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance across up to 8 distinct values.",

In their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($λ$) and TD($λ$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($λ$) to develop an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm called $\\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.\n  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the $\\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters associated with the relevant signals.\n  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.",

The model learns soft prompt embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens, these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent user behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic sampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On MovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model outperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in real-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization is also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation allows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening detection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275 ms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial institutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly versus traditional compliance checks. By preventing contagion in payment networks (e.g., Fedwire), the framework strengthens national financial infrastructure resilience.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability, and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively under uncertainty.",

However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering verbatim training data replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. We challenge this assumption and demonstrate that, even after such pruning, small perturbations to the text embeddings of previously mitigated prompts can re-trigger data replication, revealing the fragility of such defenses. Our further analysis then provides multiple indications that memorization is indeed not inherently local: (1) replication triggers for memorized images are distributed throughout text embedding space; (2) embeddings yielding the same replicated image produce divergent model activations; and (3) different pruning methods identify inconsistent sets of memorization-related weights for the same image. Finally, we show that bypassing the locality assumption enables more robust mitigation through adversarial fine-tuning. These findings provide new insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and inform the development of more reliable mitigations against DM memorization.",

    "abstract": "Although unified MLLMs aim to unify generation and understanding, they are considered to exhibit an internal gap, with understanding outperforming generation. Through large-scale evaluation across multiple MLLMs and tasks, we confirm the widespread non-unification of MLLMs, and demonstrate that it indeed stems from weak generation rather than misunderstanding. This finding motivates us to propose a simple yet effective internal gap-based self-improvement framework, which mitigates internal gaps by leveraging stronger understanding to guide weaker generation without relying on any external signals. We validate this strategy through comprehensive experiments: scoring generations with understanding to construct image data for post-training (e.g., SFT and DPO) significantly improves generation while promoting unification. Furthermore, we empirically discover a co-improvement effect of such self-improvement, a phenomenon well known in pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Specifically, as generation improves, understanding becomes more effective at detecting false positives that were previously misclassified as prompt-aligned. To explain this effect, we extend learning dynamic theory to the MLLM setting, showing that the shared empirical neural tangent kernel between generation and understanding encourages aligned learning dynamics, thereby driving co-improvement. This interplay between generation and understanding further motivates a curriculum learning approach for stronger self-improvement: progressively enhanced understanding and generation revisit samples underutilized by pre-trained MLLMs, dynamically expanding post-training data and leading to improved performance and unification.",

AI-driven solutions have made inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.",

    "abstract": "A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension.The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. This is a circuit-aware reward, in contrast to the current trend of works on this topic, which are primarily fidelity-based. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables practical navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set still yields low depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm robustness and adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach, with our completely circuit-aware method, efficiently explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit optimization.",

    "abstract": "Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations, and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced. A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted, offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a comparable model-based approach.",

A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame classes.

Our results show that while some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust. Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather than issuing prescriptive advice.

In the context of constrained devices and the related impact of low-power, over-the-air transport protocols, the performance of split learning remains largely unexplored. TO the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first end-to-end TinyML + SL testbed built on Espressif ESP32-S3 boards, designed to benchmark the over-the-air performance of split learning TinyML in edge/IoT environments. We benchmark the performance of a MobileNetV2 image recognition model, which is quantized to 8-bit integers, partitioned, and delivered to the nodes via over-the-air updates. The intermediate activations are exchanged through different wireless communication methods: ESP-NOW, BLE, and traditional UDP/IP and TCP/IP, enabling a head-to-head comparison on identical hardware. Measurements show that splitting the model after block_16_project_BN layer generates a 5.66 kB tensor that traverses the link in 3.2 ms, when UDP is used, achieving a steady-state round-trip latency of 5.8 s.

    "abstract": "Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

Our approach extends previous structured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes through a modified DeepONet architecture that incorporates local geometry in the neural network. The architecture employs local mesh topology to ensure rotation invariance, while also ensuring first-order constraint on the learned operator. The training methodology incorporates physics-informed regularization through entropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter regularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in shock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets solutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial conditions with periodic boundary conditions, enabling robust generalization to complex flow configurations or geometries. Validation test cases from the literature, including challenging geometry configuration, demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order finite volume schemes. The method achieves gains of 20-60% in solution accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency. A convergence study has been conveyed and reveal improved mesh convergence rates compared to the conventional solver. The proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than the traditional second-order finite volume solver, enabling high-fidelity simulations on coarser grids while preserving the stability and conservation properties essential for hyperbolic conservation laws. This work is a part of a new generation of solvers that are built by combining Machine-Learning (ML) tools with traditional numerical schemes, all while ensuring physical constraint on the results.",

    "abstract": "Most existing text-to-audio (TTA) generation methods produce mono outputs, neglecting essential spatial information for immersive auditory experiences. To address this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource binaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control. First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times, resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality and spatial perceptual accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked, must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation accuracy.",

Existing FGL surveys have contributed meaningfully but largely focus on integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Machine Learning (GML), resulting in early stage taxonomies that emphasis on methodology and simulated scenarios. Notably, a data centric perspective, which systematically examines FGL methods through the lens of data properties and usage, remains unadapted to reorganize FGL research, yet it is critical to assess how FGL studies manage to tackle data centric constraints to enhance model performances. This survey propose a two-level data centric taxonomy: Data Characteristics, which categorizes studies based on the structural and distributional properties of datasets used in FGL, and Data Utilization, which analyzes the training procedures and techniques employed to overcome key data centric challenges. Each taxonomy level is defined by three orthogonal criteria, each representing a distinct data centric configuration. Beyond taxonomy, this survey examines FGL integration with Pretrained Large Models, showcases realistic applications, and highlights future direction aligned with emerging trends in GML.",

    "abstract": "Detecting security vulnerabilities in source code remains challenging, particularly due to class imbalance in real-world datasets where vulnerable functions are under-represented. Existing learning-based methods often optimise for recall, leading to high false positive rates and reduced usability in development workflows. Furthermore, many approaches lack explainability, limiting their integration into security workflows. This paper presents ExplainVulD, a graph-based framework for vulnerability detection in C/C++ code. The method constructs Code Property Graphs and represents nodes using dual-channel embeddings that capture both semantic and structural information. These are processed by an edge-aware attention mechanism that incorporates edge-type embeddings to distinguish among program relations. To address class imbalance, the model is trained using class-weighted cross-entropy loss. ExplainVulD achieves a mean accuracy of 88.25 percent and an F1 score of 48.23 percent across 30 independent runs on the ReVeal dataset. These results represent relative improvements of 4.6 percent in accuracy and 16.9 percent in F1 score compared to the ReVeal model, a prior learning-based method. The framework also outperforms static analysis tools, with relative gains of 14.0 to 14.1 percent in accuracy and 132.2 to 201.2 percent in F1 score. Beyond improved detection performance, ExplainVulD produces explainable outputs by identifying the most influential code regions within each function, supporting transparency and trust in security triage.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works, scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture. First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date, consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1) Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications, from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data priors from Aerial-Earth3D.

    "abstract": "To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\\&D, strategic deception and scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the \"AI-$45^\\circ$ Law,\" we evaluate these risks using \"red lines\" (intolerable thresholds) and \"yellow lines\" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\\&D risks. For self-replication, and strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.",

However, the field faces two major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily rely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available benchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements often falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes it easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the decomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed.

However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information.

Existing science benchmarks have made progress towards broad Range, wide Reach, and high Rigor, yet they often face two major challenges: data leakage risks that compromise benchmarking validity, and evaluation inefficiency due to large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE), a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public EESE-Pool with over 100K expertly constructed science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring Range, Reach, and Rigor, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset EESE, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations. Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions.

    "abstract": "Humans flexibly construct internal models to navigate novel situations. To be useful, these internal models must be sufficiently faithful to the environment that resource-limited planning leads to adequate outcomes; equally, they must be tractable to construct in the first place. We argue that analogy plays a central role in these processes, enabling agents to reuse solution-relevant structure from past experiences and amortise the computational costs of both model construction (construal) and planning. Formalising analogies as partial homomorphisms between Markov decision processes, we sketch a framework in which abstract modules, derived from previous construals, serve as composable building blocks for new ones. This modular reuse allows for flexible adaptation of policies and representations across domains with shared structural essence.",

Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream), which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.",

This study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7 different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint, to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations). Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other, compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Code translation is a crucial process in software development and migration projects, enabling interoperability between different programming languages and enhancing software adaptability and thus longevity. Traditional automated translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which often lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models present promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based implementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models, narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity. ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a secure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation pipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in developer acceleration.",

While existing methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained, paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally, our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset, EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing approaches by a large margin.",

In parallel, we propose meta-alignment as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured feedback ingestion, including \"likes\", overrides, and abstentions. We provide formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model \"thinks\" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.",

In the partially linear regression (PLR) setting, Mackey et al. (2018) recently found that estimation consistency can be improved with non-Gaussian treatment noise. Non-Gaussianity is also a crucial assumption for identifying latent factors in ICA. We provide the first theoretical and empirical insights into this connection, showing that ICA can be used for causal effect estimation in the PLR model.

It is a challenging problem subject to many constraints, like to determine the starting time of different surgeries and allocating the required resources, including the availability of beds in different department units. Recently, solutions to this problem based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) have been delivered. Such solutions are overall satisfying but, when applied to real data, they can currently only verify whether the encoding aligns with the actual data and, at most, suggest alternative schedules that could have been computed. As a consequence, it is not currently possible to generate provisional schedules. Furthermore, the resulting schedules are not always robust.\n  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving these issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the surgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then, we consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our problem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust schedules.

    "abstract": "Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas, continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected vehicles and trains.",

A model-free agent cannot plan, but can act without a model and without completely observing the environment. An autonomous agent capable of acting independently in novel environments must combine both sets of capabilities. We show how to create such an agent with Meta-Interpretive Learning used to learn a model-based Solver used to train a model-free Controller that can solve the same planning problems as the Solver. We demonstrate the equivalence in problem-solving ability of the two agents on grid navigation problems in two kinds of environment: randomly generated mazes, and lake maps with wide open areas.

    "abstract": "This paper examines the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by AI-driven recommender systems (RSs), which increasingly shape digital environments and social interactions. By curating personalized content, RSs do not merely reflect user preferences but actively construct experiences across social media, entertainment platforms, and e-commerce. Their influence raises concerns over privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being, while existing approaches such as \"algorethics\" - the effort to embed ethical principles into algorithmic design - remain insufficient. RSs inherently reduce human complexity to quantifiable profiles, exploit user vulnerabilities, and prioritize engagement over well-being. The paper advances a three-dimensional framework for human-centered RSs, integrating policies and regulation, interdisciplinary research, and education. These strategies are mutually reinforcing: research provides evidence for policy, policy enables safeguards and standards, and education equips users to engage critically. By connecting ethical reflection with governance and digital literacy, the paper argues that RSs can be reoriented to enhance autonomy and dignity rather than undermine them.",

    "abstract": "The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to their training data, which can include copyrighted material or private information, raising legal and ethical concerns. Additionally, LLMs face criticism for dataset contamination and internalizing biases. To address these issues, the Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss, resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs.",

Mainly fueled by deep learning approaches, progress has been limited by the scarcity and limited annotations of datasets. To address this, we present the Guitar On Audio and Tablatures (GOAT) dataset, comprising 5.9 hours of unique high-quality direct input audio recordings of electric guitars from a variety of different guitars and players. We also present an effective data augmentation strategy using guitar amplifiers which delivers near-unlimited tonal variety, of which we provide a starting 29.5 hours of audio. Each recording is annotated using guitar tablatures, a guitar-specific symbolic format supporting string and fret numbers, as well as numerous playing techniques. For this we utilise both the Guitar Pro format, a software for tablature playback and editing, and a text-like token encoding. Furthermore, we present competitive results using GOAT for MIDI transcription and preliminary results for a novel approach to automatic guitar tablature transcription. We hope that GOAT opens up the possibilities to train novel models on a wide variety of guitar-related MIR tasks, from synthesis to transcription to playing technique detection.",

This ability relies on a background theory and negative examples, both carefully selected with expert knowledge of a learning problem and its solutions. But what if such a problem-specific background theory or negative examples are not available? We formalise this question as a new setting for Self-Supervised ILP and present a new MIL algorithm that learns in the new setting from some positive labelled, and zero or more unlabelled examples, and automatically generates, and labels, new positive and negative examples during learning. We implement this algorithm in Prolog in a new MIL system, called Poker. We compare Poker to state-of-the-art MIL system Louise on experiments learning grammars for Context-Free and L-System languages from labelled, positive example strings, no negative examples, and just the terminal vocabulary of a language, seen in examples, as a first-order background theory. We introduce a new approach for the principled selection of a second-order background theory as a Second Order Definite Normal Form (SONF), sufficiently general to learn all programs in a class, thus removing the need for a backgound theory tailored to a learning task. We find that Poker's performance improves with increasing numbers of automatically generated examples while Louise, bereft of negative examples, over-generalises.",

    "abstract": "Atomic commits, which address a single development concern, are a best practice in software development. In practice, however, developers often produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes, complicating code review and maintenance. Prior untangling approaches (rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based) have made progress but typically rely on shallow signals and struggle to distinguish explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) from implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture structural and contextual information, we construct Explicit and Implicit Contexts, enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 82% on the Java dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based collaborative frameworks for advancing automated commit untangling tasks.",

Among the methodologies employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines, yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like ``Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual statements cannot be falsified-even by randomized experiments-they underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore, providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a counterfactual assumption via random-process probability distributions with preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of structural causal models. Using these representations, we present a normalization procedure to disentangle the (arbitrary and unfalsifiable) counterfactual choice from the (typically testable) interventional constraints. In contrast to structural causal models, this allows to implement many counterfactual assumptions while preserving interventional knowledge, and does not require any estimation step at the individual-counterfactual layer: only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach on theoretical and numerical examples.",

Many MAPF solvers are designed to run offline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them. Real-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot wait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to move. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must commit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time, referred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively call windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without explicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and explore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed versions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and MAPF-LNS2. Our exploration shows that the baseline approach in which all agents draw from a shared planning budget pool is ineffective in over-constrained situations. Instead, policies that distribute the planning budget over the agents are able to solve more problems with a smaller makespan.",

This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges.

In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries. DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the supervised CRNN baseline.

    "abstract": "Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters, text-to-image (T2I) generative systems are still susceptible to producing harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs from the T2I system, is increasingly recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before real-world deployment. However, existing automated red teaming approaches often treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system. Unlike prior work that optimizes prompts individually, DREAM directly models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into a simple and tractable form. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provides stable gradient estimates through the long and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. During inference, we also propose a diversity-aware sampling strategy to enhance prompt variety. The effectiveness of DREAM is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of T2I models and safety filters in terms of both prompt success rate and diversity.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and national guidelines drive care. Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31 quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English medical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA, MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural fit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB (5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in three sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility. Discussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking misleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health systems.",

Users can access different compressed model versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood.\n  In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three widely used compression configurations that are pruning, quantization, and weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model, CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization. Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials, processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.",

However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are found to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, as we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety, while effectively preserving benign generation capability.

    "abstract": "Deep learning achieved great progress recently, however, it is not easy or efficient to further improve its performance by increasing the size of the model. Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer and more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited access to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning by introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a student model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via distillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely differing modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce a cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained loss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can easily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we propose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature level and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a quality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified data quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on speaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that our approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the commonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.",

Our dual evaluation framework combines rubric assessment, which uses expert-designed criteria to evaluate insight quality, with factual assessment, which measures citation accuracy (faithfulness) and coverage (groundedness). We evaluated several leading commercial DARS and baseline systems. Results show that OpenAI Deep Research and Gemini Deep Research significantly outperform other systems, with particular strength in open-ended consulting questions. Such capabilities represent a meaningful step toward AI self-improvement, aligning with the vision of ASI for AI.

We introduce a controlled framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty (e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First, the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption. Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.",

We propose a method to enhance LLM-based tutors by representing the dialogue history with a lower-dimensional latent state representation of a student and optimizing a long-term policy to determine high-level actions based on the latent state. The goal is to better align the tutor's behavior with the long-term objective of guiding the student towards solving a target math problem on their own. Our model is lightweight, requiring less computational resources than prior work of training the tutor policy end-to-end to directly output the tutor's next utterance. Our experiment results demonstrate that these modifications lead to improved long-term outcomes compared to prompting in LLM-simulated tutoring tasks.",

Existing methods are typically constrained to processing small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies. Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads, demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Early large-scale audio datasets, such as LibriSpeech, were built with hundreds of individual contributors whose voices were instrumental in the development of speech technologies, including audiobooks and voice assistants. Yet, a decade later, these same contributions have exposed voice actors to a range of risks. While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit, and Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks involving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context, authorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional voice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without enforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond reputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive political messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about accountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that are deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation campaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal fallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or union protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the PRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation, Accountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of data used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy risks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm arises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be reimagined AI Data ecosystems. We argue that voice, as both a biometric identifier and creative labor, demands governance models that restore creator agency, ensure traceability, and establish enforceable boundaries for ethical reuse.",

In our proposed framework, flows labelled as malicious by NIDS are initially processed through a module called the Prompt Augmenter. This module extracts contextual information and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)-related knowledge from these flows. This enriched, context-specific data is then integrated with an input prompt for an LLM, enabling it to generate detailed explanations and interpretations of why the flow was identified as malicious by NIDS. We compare the generated interpretations against a Basic-Prompt Explainer baseline, which does not incorporate any contextual information into the LLM's input prompt. Our framework is quantitatively evaluated using the Llama 3 and GPT-4 models, employing a novel evaluation method tailored for natural language explanations, focusing on their correctness and consistency. The results demonstrate that augmented LLMs can produce accurate and consistent explanations, serving as valuable complementary tools in NIDS to explain the classification of malicious flows. The use of augmented prompts enhances performance by over 20% compared to the Basic-Prompt Explainer.",

This paper explores the role of large language model (LLM)-powered voice assistants in enhancing preventive care and continuous patient monitoring, particularly in underserved populations. Drawing insights from the development and pilot study of Agent PULSE (Patient Understanding and Liaison Support Engine) -- a collaborative initiative between IBM Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and Morehouse School of Medicine -- we present an economic model demonstrating how AI agents can provide cost-effective healthcare services where human intervention is economically unfeasible. Our pilot study with 33 inflammatory bowel disease patients revealed that 70\\% expressed acceptance of AI-driven monitoring, with 37\\% preferring it over traditional modalities. Technical challenges, including real-time conversational AI processing, integration with healthcare systems, and privacy compliance, are analyzed alongside policy considerations surrounding regulation, bias mitigation, and patient autonomy. Our findings suggest that AI-driven voice agents not only enhance healthcare scalability and efficiency but also improve patient engagement and accessibility. For healthcare executives, our cost-utility analysis demonstrates huge potential savings for routine monitoring tasks, while technologists can leverage our framework to prioritize improvements yielding the highest patient impact.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained models and their associated training data are considered confidential intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently. In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.\n  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks. These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the probability and uncertainty forecasts of five recently proposed Bayesian deep learning methods relative to a deterministic residual neural network (ResNet) baseline for 0-1 h convective initiation (CI) nowcasting using GOES-16 satellite infrared observations. Uncertainty was assessed by how well probabilistic forecasts were calibrated and how well uncertainty separated forecasts with large and small errors. Most of the Bayesian deep learning methods produced probabilistic forecasts that outperformed the deterministic ResNet, with one, the initial-weights ensemble + Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, an ensemble of deterministic ResNets with different initial weights to start training and dropout activated during inference, producing the most skillful and well-calibrated forecasts. The initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout benefited from generating multiple solutions that more thoroughly sampled the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble was the only one that performed worse than the deterministic ResNet at longer lead times, likely due to the challenge of optimizing a larger number of parameters. To address this issue, the Bayesian-MOPED (MOdel Priors with Empirical Bayes using Deep neural network) ResNet ensemble was adopted, and it enhanced forecast skill by constraining the hypothesis search near the deterministic ResNet hypothesis. All Bayesian methods demonstrated well-calibrated uncertainty and effectively separated cases with large and small errors. In case studies, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout demonstrated better forecast skill than the Bayesian-MOPED ensemble and the deterministic ResNet on selected CI events in clear-sky regions. However, the initial-weights ensemble + MC dropout exhibited poorer generalization in clear-sky and anvil cloud regions without CI occurrence compared to the deterministic ResNet and Bayesian-MOPED ensemble.",

In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.",

This work presents a complete pipeline integrating advanced computer vision techniques with adaptive nonlinear filtering to address this challenge. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), enhanced with image preprocessing, detects structural markers (corners) from chaser imagery, whose 2D coordinates are converted to 3D measurements using camera modeling. These measurements are fused within an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework, selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relative dynamics, to estimate the full relative pose. Key contributions include the integrated system architecture and a dual adaptive strategy within the UKF: dynamic tuning of the measurement noise covariance compensates for varying CNN measurement uncertainty, while adaptive tuning of the process noise covariance, utilizing measurement residual analysis, accounts for unmodeled dynamics or maneuvers online. This dual adaptation enhances robustness against both measurement imperfections and dynamic model uncertainties. The performance of the proposed adaptive integrated system is evaluated through high-fidelity simulations using a realistic ENVISAT model, comparing estimates against ground truth under various conditions, including measurement outages. This comprehensive approach offers an enhanced solution for robust onboard relative navigation, significantly advancing the capabilities required for safe proximity operations during ADR missions.",

To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models (LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning, responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable production-ready code.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead. Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning (FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator (FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings. Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL network.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of generative AI, synthetic content across images, videos, and audio has become increasingly realistic, amplifying the risk of misinformation. Existing detection approaches predominantly focus on binary classification while lacking detailed and interpretable explanations of forgeries, which limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. Moreover, current methods often treat each modality separately, without a unified benchmark for cross-modal forgery detection and interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce METER, a unified, multi-modal benchmark for interpretable forgery detection spanning images, videos, audio, and audio-visual content. Our dataset comprises four tracks, each requiring not only real-vs-fake classification but also evidence-chain-based explanations, including spatio-temporal localization, textual rationales, and forgery type tracing. Compared to prior benchmarks, METER offers broader modality coverage and richer interpretability metrics such as spatial/temporal IoU, multi-class tracing, and evidence consistency. We further propose a human-aligned, three-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training strategy combining SFT, DPO, and a novel GRPO stage that integrates a human-aligned evaluator with CoT reasoning. We hope METER will serve as a standardized foundation for advancing generalizable and interpretable forgery detection in the era of generative media.",

    "abstract": "A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) for Internet of Things (IoT) network architecture is investigated, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in the shadowed regions, while accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices, we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, IoT device association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture in IoT network achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.",

However, with the globalization of integrated circuit design and the continuous upgrading of security requirements, the SVA development model has exposed major limitations. It is not only inefficient in development, but also unable to effectively deal with the increasing number of security vulnerabilities in modern complex integrated circuits. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative SVA automatic generation framework SVAgent. SVAgent introduces a requirement decomposition mechanism to transform the original complex requirements into a structured, gradually solvable fine-grained problem-solving chain. Experiments have shown that SVAgent can effectively suppress the influence of hallucinations and random answers, and the key evaluation indicators such as the accuracy and consistency of the SVA are significantly better than existing frameworks. More importantly, we successfully integrated SVAgent into the most mainstream integrated circuit vulnerability assessment framework and verified its practicality and reliability in a real engineering design environment.",

With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system complexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time energy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a diffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable adaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon emissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a denoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and enables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid environments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms classic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower operational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of its carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability. These results highlight DiffCarl as a practical and forward-looking solution. Its flexible design allows efficient adaptation to different system configurations and objectives to support real-world deployment in evolving energy systems.",

    "abstract": "We report a structural convergence among four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind, emerging unintentionally within a practical AI architecture known as Agentic Flow. Designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interlocking modules: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action, organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, subsequent analysis revealed that its structure echoes computational motifs from all four theories, suggesting that theoretical convergence can emerge naturally from implementation demands rather than deliberate synthesis. Controlled evaluations confirmed this: the structured agent achieved 95.8% task success versus 62.3% for baseline LLMs, demonstrating robust constraint adherence and reproducible reasoning. We describe this convergence under a broader descriptive meta-architecture called PEACE, highlighting recurring design patterns such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control. Later formalized as the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), this framework generalizes the same principles as a foundation for behavioral intelligence in LLM-based agents. Rather than claiming theoretical unification, this paper proposes that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns shaped by practical constraints. As a position paper, it aims to frame this convergence as an interpretive reflection rather than a finalized theory, inviting further theoretical and experimental dialogue. Agentic Flow, or equivalently the Structured Cognitive Loop, thus offers a glimpse of how a unified cognitive form can arise not from abstraction, but from the necessities of real-world reasoning.",

In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model (DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a dynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the dynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework is implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that DWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and the learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection methods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a model's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights into the data preference of the model during training.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples in theory and practice. Where previous attacks have focused mainly on visual models that exploit the difference between human and machine perception, text-based models have also fallen victim to these attacks. However, these attacks often fail to maintain the semantic meaning of the text and similarity. This paper introduces AdvChar, a black-box attack on Interpretable Natural Language Processing Systems, designed to mislead the classifier while keeping the interpretation similar to benign inputs, thus exploiting trust in system transparency. AdvChar achieves this by making less noticeable modifications to text input, forcing the deep learning classifier to make incorrect predictions and preserve the original interpretation. We use an interpretation-focused scoring approach to determine the most critical tokens that, when changed, can cause the classifier to misclassify the input. We apply simple character-level modifications to measure the importance of tokens, minimizing the difference between the original and new text while generating adversarial interpretations similar to benign ones. We thoroughly evaluated AdvChar by testing it against seven NLP models and three interpretation models using benchmark datasets for the classification task. Our experiments show that AdvChar can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of current deep learning models by altering just two characters on average in input samples.",

A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\\bf Latent Space Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches. When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\\% TOPIQ score improvement.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8977 (95% CI: 0.88-0.91). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.",

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to identify and mitigate online hate, yet most research on online ableism focuses on Western audiences with Western AI models. Are these models adequately equipped to recognize ableist harm in non-Western places like India? Do localized, Indic language models perform better? To investigate, we adopted and translated a publicly available ableist speech dataset to Hindi, and prompted eight LLMs--four developed in the U.S. (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama) and four in India (Krutrim, Nanda, Gajendra, Airavata)--to score and explain ableism. In parallel, we recruited 175 PwD from both the U.S. and India to perform the same task, revealing stark differences between groups. Western LLMs consistently overestimated ableist harm, while Indic LLMs underestimated it. Even more concerning, all LLMs were more tolerant of ableism when it was expressed in Hindi and asserted Western framings of ableist harm. In contrast, Indian PwD interpreted harm through intention, relationality, and resilience--emphasizing a desire to inform and educate perpetrators. This work provides groundwork for global, inclusive standards of ableism, demonstrating the need to center local disability experiences in the design and evaluation of AI systems.",

Our analysis concludes that models consistently misuse tax tables, make errors in tax calculation, and incorrectly determine eligibility. Our findings point to the need for additional infrastructure to apply LLMs to the personal income tax calculation task.",

    "abstract": "While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.",

In response to this,\nwe introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time\nAI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users\nbrowse the web.

    "abstract": "Developing web-based GIS applications, commonly known as CyberGIS dashboards,\nfor querying and visualizing GIS data in environmental research often demands\nrepetitive and resource-intensive efforts. While Generative AI offers\nautomation potential for code generation, it struggles with complex scientific\napplications due to challenges in integrating domain knowledge, software\nengineering principles, and UI design best practices. This paper introduces a\nknowledge-augmented code generation framework that retrieves software\nengineering best practices, domain expertise, and advanced technology stacks\nfrom a specialized knowledge base to enhance Generative Pre-trained\nTransformers (GPT) for front-end development. The framework automates the\ncreation of GIS-based web applications (e.g., dashboards, interfaces) from\nuser-defined UI wireframes sketched in tools like PowerPoint or Adobe\nIllustrator. A novel Context-Aware Visual Prompting method, implemented in\nPython, extracts layouts and interface features from these wireframes to guide\ncode generation. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ngenerate front-end code by integrating structured reasoning, software\nengineering principles, and domain knowledge, drawing inspiration from\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A\ncase study demonstrates the framework's capability to generate a modular,\nmaintainable web platform hosting multiple dashboards for visualizing\nenvironmental and energy data (e.g., time-series, shapefiles, rasters) from\nuser-sketched wireframes. By employing a knowledge-driven approach, the\nframework produces scalable, industry-standard front-end code using design\npatterns such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and frameworks like React. This\nsignificantly reduces manual effort in design and coding, pioneering an\nautomated and efficient method for developing smart city software.",

Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset\nand the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and\ndiverse labeled samples.

We propose a\nsolution to this problem, leveraging the framework of utility functions to\nstudy the internal coherence of AI preferences.

These findings\nsuggest that value systems emerge in LLMs in a meaningful sense, a finding with\nbroad implications. To study these emergent value systems, we propose utility\nengineering as a research agenda, comprising both the analysis and control of\nAI utilities. We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM\nassistants despite existing control measures. These include cases where AIs\nvalue themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals. To\nconstrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control.\nAs a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces\npolitical biases and generalizes to new scenarios.

Our agents aim to maximize the expected growth rate of\ntheir wealth but have different theories on how to learn this best. We focus on\ncomparing Bayesian and no-regret learners in market dynamics. Bayesian learners\nwith a prior over a finite set of models that assign positive prior probability\nto the correct model have posterior probabilities that converge exponentially\nto the correct model. Consequently, they survive even in the presence of agents\nwho invest according to the correct model of the stochastic process. Bayesians\nwith a continuum prior converge to the correct model at a rate of $O((\\log\nT)/T)$. Online learning theory provides no-regret algorithms for maximizing the\nlog of wealth in this setting, achieving a worst-case regret bound of $O(\\log\nT)$ without assuming a steady underlying stochastic process but comparing to\nthe best fixed investment rule. This regret, as we observe, is of the same\norder of magnitude as that of a Bayesian learner with a continuum prior.\nHowever, we show that even such low regret may not be sufficient for survival\nin asset markets: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\\log T)$, but still\nvanish in market dynamics when competing against agents who invest according to\nthe correct model or even against a perfect Bayesian with a finite prior. On\nthe other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret\nlearning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more\nrobust. Any no-regret learner will drive out of the market an imperfect\nBayesian whose finite prior or update rule has even small errors. We formally\nestablish the relationship between notions of survival, vanishing, and market\ndomination studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus\nbridging these theories.",

To close\nthis gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach\nleveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations\nthrough: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to\nmitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing,\nhierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover,\nFBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the\ndevelopment of more specialized models tailored to the specific data\ndistribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it\nextensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We\ndemonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs\ncomparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging\nnon-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other\nstate-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been\nspecifically designed to address non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we\nshowcase the resilience of FBFL's self-organizing hierarchical architecture\nagainst server failures.",

    "abstract": "The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\ndatasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of\ndisease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for\nindividual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current\nmethods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific\nindividualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing\nlongitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel\nspatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression\nin 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates\nin a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by\nhigh-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata\nto enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior\nknowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the\nintegration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average\nStabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in\nthe predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a\nmeasure of the uncertainty for the prediction. We train and evaluate BrLP on\n11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its\ngeneralizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962\nsubjects.

A major bottleneck in effectively\nconducting multi-institutional EHR studies is the data heterogeneity across\nsystems with numerous codes that either do not exist or represent different\nclinical concepts across institutions. The need for data privacy further limits\nthe feasibility of including multi-institutional patient-level data required to\nstudy similarities and differences across patient subgroups. To address these\nchallenges, we developed the GAME algorithm. Tested and validated across 7\ninstitutions and 2 languages, GAME integrates data in several levels: (1) at\nthe institutional level with knowledge graphs to establish relationships\nbetween codes and existing knowledge sources, providing the medical context for\nstandard codes and their relationship to each other; (2) between institutions,\nleveraging language models to determine the relationships between\ninstitution-specific codes with established standard codes; and (3) quantifying\nthe strength of the relationships between codes using a graph attention\nnetwork. Jointly trained embeddings are created using transfer and federated\nlearning to preserve data privacy. In this study, we demonstrate the\napplicability of GAME in selecting relevant features as inputs for AI-driven\nalgorithms in a range of conditions, e.g., heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis.\nWe then highlight the application of GAME harmonized multi-institutional EHR\ndata in a study of Alzheimer's disease outcomes and suicide risk among patients\nwith mental health disorders, without sharing patient-level data outside\nindividual institutions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding human behavior and society is a central focus in social\nsciences, with the rise of generative social science marking a significant\nparadigmatic shift. By leveraging bottom-up simulations, it replaces costly and\nlogistically challenging traditional experiments with scalable, replicable, and\nsystematic computational approaches for studying complex social dynamics.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further transformed this\nresearch paradigm, enabling the creation of human-like generative social agents\nand realistic simulacra of society. In this paper, we propose AgentSociety, a\nlarge-scale social simulator that integrates LLM-driven agents, a realistic\nsocietal environment, and a powerful large-scale simulation engine. Based on\nthe proposed simulator, we generate social lives for over 10k agents,\nsimulating their 5 million interactions both among agents and between agents\nand their environment. Furthermore, we explore the potential of AgentSociety as\na testbed for computational social experiments, focusing on four key social\nissues: polarization, the spread of inflammatory messages, the effects of\nuniversal basic income policies, and the impact of external shocks such as\nhurricanes. These four issues serve as valuable cases for assessing\nAgentSociety's support for typical research methods -- such as surveys,\ninterviews, and interventions -- as well as for investigating the patterns,\ncauses, and underlying mechanisms of social issues. The alignment between\nAgentSociety's outcomes and real-world experimental results not only\ndemonstrates its ability to capture human behaviors and their underlying\nmechanisms, but also underscores its potential as an important platform for\nsocial scientists and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for\nenhancing language model's reasoning capabilities. However, generating long and\ncorrect CoT trajectories is challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated that\nLooped Transformers possess remarkable length generalization capabilities, but\ntheir limited generality and adaptability prevent them from serving as an\nalternative to auto-regressive solutions. To better leverage the strengths of\nLooped Transformers, we propose RELAY (REasoning through Loop Alignment\niterativelY). Specifically, we align the steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning with loop iterations and apply intermediate supervision during the\ntraining of Looped Transformers. This additional iteration-wise supervision not\nonly preserves the Looped Transformer's ability for length generalization but\nalso enables it to predict CoT reasoning steps for unseen data. Therefore, we\nleverage this Looped Transformer to generate accurate reasoning chains for\ncomplex problems that exceed the training length, which will then be used to\nfine-tune an auto-regressive model. We conduct extensive experiments, and the\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant\nimprovements in the performance of the auto-regressive model.

    "abstract": "Multimodal embedding models have gained significant attention for their\nability to map data from different modalities, such as text and images, into a\nunified representation space. However, the limited labeled multimodal data\noften hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data\nsynthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a\ncritical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality\nsynthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data\ncovers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream\nscenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities\nsemantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data\nmaintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these\nprinciples, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks,\nmodality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking\nprocess within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3)\nincorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring\nfidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality\nsynthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model\nmmE5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the\nXTD benchmark.

Unlike denoising modules that rely on multiple iterative\nsteps, text encoders require only a single forward pass to produce text\nembeddings. However, despite their minimal contribution to total inference time\nand floating-point operations (FLOPs), text encoders demand significantly\nhigher memory usage, up to eight times more than denoising modules. To address\nthis inefficiency, we propose Skip and Re-use layers (Skrr), a simple yet\neffective pruning strategy specifically designed for text encoders in T2I\ndiffusion models. Skrr exploits the inherent redundancy in transformer blocks\nby selectively skipping or reusing certain layers in a manner tailored for T2I\ntasks, thereby reducing memory consumption without compromising performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Skrr maintains image quality comparable\nto the original model even under high sparsity levels, outperforming existing\nblockwise pruning methods.

Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have\nshown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal.\nHowever, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems:\n(1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is\nsignificantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and\nocclusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack\ncrucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary\nfor fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations,\nwe propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns\ncorrespondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and\nrobot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware\npoint clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand.\nThese point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also\nincorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information,\neffectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method\ndemonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in six real-world tasks, surpassing other\nbaselines by a large margin.

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to task-agnostic exploration\nwhen we aim to explore the environment without access to the task specification\na priori. In a single-agent setting the problem has been extensively studied\nand mostly understood. A popular approach cast the task-agnostic objective as\nmaximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy,\nfrom which principles and methods follows. In contrast, little is known about\ntask-agnostic exploration in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the\nreal world. How should different agents explore in the presence of others? In\nthis paper, we address this question through a generalization to multiple\nagents of the problem of maximizing the state distribution entropy. First, we\ninvestigate alternative formulations, highlighting respective positives and\nnegatives. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy\nsearch algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we\nprovide proof of concept experiments to both corroborate the theoretical\nfindings and pave the way for task-agnostic exploration in challenging\nmulti-agent settings.",

However, calculating attention\nis computationally intensive due to its quadratic dependency on the sequence\nlength. We introduce a novel approach called Top-Theta Attention, or simply\nTop-$\\theta$, which selectively prunes less essential attention elements by\ncomparing them against carefully calibrated thresholds. This method greatly\nimproves the efficiency of self-attention matrix multiplication while\npreserving model accuracy, reducing the number of required V cache rows by 3x\nduring generative decoding and the number of attention elements by 10x during\nthe prefill phase. Our method does not require model retraining; instead, it\nrequires only a brief calibration phase to be resilient to distribution shifts,\nthus not requiring the thresholds for different datasets to be recalibrated.\nUnlike top-k attention, Top-$\\theta$ eliminates full-vector dependency, making\nit suitable for tiling and scale-out and avoiding costly top-k search. A key\ninnovation of our approach is the development of efficient numerical\ncompensation techniques, which help preserve model accuracy even under\naggressive pruning of attention scores.",

    "abstract": "Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a\nfundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning,\nexisting models fail to generalize across different market conditions and\nassets. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we\nshow that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of\ncomplex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we\npropose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to\ncapture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to\nadaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective\nfor longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also\nintroduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the\nhorizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons, using the\nestablished FI-2010 benchmark, a NASDAQ and a Bitcoin dataset. TLOB outperforms\nSoTA methods in every dataset and horizon. Additionally, we empirically show\nhow stock price predictability has declined over time, -6.68 in F1-score,\nhighlighting the growing market efficiency. Predictability must be considered\nin relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using\nan average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting\nperformance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend\nclassification into profitable trading strategies.

However, during the global partition\nphase, misclusterings within subgraphs have a tendency to progressively\ncompound throughout the multi-step decoding process of the learning-based\npartition policy. This suboptimal behavior in the global partition phase, in\nturn, may lead to a dramatic deterioration in the performance of the overall\ndecomposition-based system, despite using optimal local constructions. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a versatile Hierarchical Learning-based\nGraph Partition (HLGP) framework, which is tailored to benefit the partition of\nCVRP instances by synergistically integrating global and local partition\npolicies. Specifically, the global partition policy is tasked with creating the\ncoarse multi-way partition to generate the sequence of simpler two-way\npartition subtasks. These subtasks mark the initiation of the subsequent K\nlocal partition levels. At each local partition level, subtasks exclusive for\nthis level are assigned to the local partition policy which benefits from the\ninsensitive local topological features to incrementally alleviate the\ncompounded errors. This framework is versatile in the sense that it optimizes\nthe involved partition policies towards a unified objective harmoniously\ncompatible with both reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL).\n(*Due to the notification of arXiv \"The Abstract field cannot be longer than\n1,920 characters\", the appeared Abstract is shortened.

    "abstract": "Scaling up inference-time compute has proven to be a valuable strategy in\nimproving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without fine-tuning.\nAn important task that can benefit from additional inference-time compute is\nself-repair; given an initial flawed response, or guess, the LLM corrects its\nown mistake and produces an improved response, or fix. We leverage the\nin-context learning ability of LLMs to perform self-repair in the coding\ndomain. The key contribution of our paper is an approach that synthesises and\nselects an ordered set of golden example pairs, or AuPairs, of these initial\nguesses and subsequent fixes for the corresponding problems. Each such AuPair\nis provided as a single in-context example at inference time to generate a\nrepaired solution. For an inference-time compute budget of $N$ LLM calls per\nproblem, $N$ AuPairs are used to generate $N$ repaired solutions, out of which\nthe highest-scoring solution is selected as the final answer. The underlying\nintuition is that if the LLM is given a different example of fixing an\nincorrect guess each time, it can subsequently generate a diverse set of\nrepaired solutions. Our algorithm selects these AuPairs in a manner that\nmaximises complementarity and usefulness. We demonstrate the results of our\nalgorithm on 5 LLMs across 7 competitive programming datasets for the code\nrepair task. Our algorithm yields a significant boost in performance compared\nto best-of-$N$ and self-repair, and also exhibits strong generalisation across\ndatasets and models. Moreover, our approach shows significantly stronger\nscaling with inference-time compute budget compared to baselines.",

    "abstract": "Generative models have gained significant attention in multivariate time\nseries forecasting (MTS), particularly due to their ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity samples. Forecasting the probability distribution of multivariate\ntime series is a challenging yet practical task. Although some recent attempts\nhave been made to handle this task, two major challenges persist: 1) some\nexisting generative methods underperform in high-dimensional multivariate time\nseries forecasting, which is hard to scale to higher dimensions; 2) the\ninherent high-dimensional multivariate attributes constrain the forecasting\nlengths of existing generative models. In this paper, we point out that\ndiscrete token representations can model high-dimensional MTS with faster\ninference time, and forecasting the target with long-term trends of itself can\nextend the forecasting length with high accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose\na vector quantized framework called Hierarchical Discrete Transformer (HDT)\nthat models time series into discrete token representations with l2\nnormalization enhanced vector quantized strategy, in which we transform the MTS\nforecasting into discrete tokens generation. To address the limitations of\ngenerative models in long-term forecasting, we propose a hierarchical discrete\nTransformer. This model captures the discrete long-term trend of the target at\nthe low level and leverages this trend as a condition to generate the discrete\nrepresentation of the target at the high level that introduces the features of\nthe target itself to extend the forecasting length in high-dimensional MTS.\nExtensive experiments on five popular MTS datasets verify the effectiveness of\nour proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has enabled remarkable progress in binary code analysis. In\nparticular, pre-trained embeddings of assembly code have become a gold standard\nfor solving analysis tasks, such as measuring code similarity or recognizing\nfunctions. These embeddings are capable of learning a vector representation\nfrom unlabeled code. In contrast to natural language processing, however, label\ninformation is not scarce for many tasks in binary code analysis. For example,\nlabeled training data for function boundaries, optimization levels, and\nargument types can be easily derived from debug information provided by a\ncompiler. Consequently, the main motivation of embeddings does not transfer\ndirectly to binary code analysis.\n  In this paper, we explore the role of pre-trained embeddings from a critical\nperspective. To this end, we systematically evaluate recent embeddings for\nassembly code on five downstream tasks using a corpus of 1.2 million functions\nfrom the Debian distribution. We observe that several embeddings perform\nsimilarly when sufficient labeled data is available, and that differences\nreported in prior work are hardly noticeable. Surprisingly, we find that\nend-to-end learning without pre-training performs best on average, which calls\ninto question the need for specialized embeddings.

    "abstract": "Differentiating signals from the background in micrographs is a critical\ninitial step for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), yet it remains\nlaborious due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the presence of contaminants\nand densely packed particles of varying sizes. Although image segmentation has\nrecently been introduced to distinguish particles at the pixel level, the low\nSNR complicates the automated generation of accurate annotations for training\nsupervised models. Moreover, platforms for systematically comparing different\ndesign choices in pipeline construction are lacking. Thus, a modular framework\nis essential to understand the advantages and limitations of this approach and\ndrive further development. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline\nthat automatically generates high-quality segmentation maps from cryo-EM data\nto serve as ground truth labels. Our modular framework enables the selection of\nvarious segmentation models and loss functions. We also integrate Conditional\nRandom Fields (CRFs) with different solvers and feature sets to refine coarse\npredictions, thereby producing fine-grained segmentation. This flexibility\nfacilitates optimal configurations tailored to cryo-EM datasets. When trained\non a limited set of micrographs, our approach achieves over 90% accuracy,\nrecall, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-score on synthetic\ndata. Furthermore, to demonstrate our framework's efficacy in downstream\nanalyses, we show that the particles extracted by our pipeline produce 3D\ndensity maps with higher resolution than those generated by existing particle\npickers on real experimental datasets, while achieving performance comparable\nto that of manually curated datasets from experts.",

In offline-to-online learning, a\nlearner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown\nenvironment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data,\nthe learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its\ninitial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The\nlearner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed\nfor only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the\nLower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can\neffectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently \"covered\" by the\noffline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time,\nUCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly\nthe best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning,\nhowever, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term\nperformance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how\nlong its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and\ngradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This\narticle explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result\nshows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and\nUCB at any point in time. The core idea behind our algorithm is broadly\napplicable, and we anticipate that our results will extend beyond the\nmulti-armed bandit setting.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is often evaluated\nusing benchmarks with limited numerical ranges, failing to reflect real-world\nproblem-solving across diverse scales. Furthermore, most existing evaluation\nmethods only compare model outputs to ground-truth answers, obscuring insights\ninto reasoning processes. To address these limitations, we introduce\nGSM-Ranges, a dataset generator derived from GSM8K that systematically perturbs\nnumerical values in math problems to assess model robustness across varying\nnumerical scales. Additionally, we propose a novel grading methodology that\ndistinguishes between logical and non-logical errors, offering a more precise\nevaluation of reasoning processes beyond computational accuracy. Our\nexperiments with various models reveal a significant increase in logical error\nrates-up to 14 percentage points-as numerical complexity rises, demonstrating a\ngeneral weakness in reasoning with out-of-distribution numerical values.\nMoreover, while models demonstrate high accuracy on standalone arithmetic\ntasks, their performance deteriorates substantially when computations are\nembedded within word problems. These findings provide a comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities and inform future\nresearch directions for improving numerical generalization in language models.",

This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon\nwhere models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental\ninteraction.

We propose a framework to study these\nbehaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018\ntrajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with\ndecreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies\ntoward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that\nsimple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as\nselecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model\nperformance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These\nresults suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications.\nWe suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and\nselective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the\ndevelopment of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various\nparadigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle\nwith cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on\ndataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ\nSet-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires\nmetadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across\nplatforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks\nrather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework\nthat enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior\nworks that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI\nelements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL\nseamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen\nParsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module,\nwhich work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and\nsemantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate\nTRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot,\nVisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets.

    "abstract": "Wireless sensing is of great benefits to our daily lives. However, wireless\nsignals are sensitive to the surroundings. Various factors, e.g. environments,\nlocations, and individuals, may induce extra impact on wireless propagation.\nSuch a change can be regarded as a domain, in which the data distribution\nshifts. A vast majority of the sensing schemes are learning-based. They are\ndependent on the training domains, resulting in performance degradation in\nunseen domains. Researchers have proposed various solutions to address this\nissue. But these solutions leverage either semi-supervised or unsupervised\ndomain adaptation techniques. They still require some data in the target\ndomains and do not perform well in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a\ndomain generalization framework DGSense, to eliminate the domain dependence\nproblem in wireless sensing. The framework is a general solution working across\ndiverse sensing tasks and wireless technologies. Once the sensing model is\nbuilt, it can generalize to unseen domains without any data from the target\ndomain. To achieve the goal, we first increase the diversity of the training\nset by a virtual data generator, and then extract the domain independent\nfeatures via episodic training between the main feature extractor and the\ndomain feature extractors. The feature extractors employ a pre-trained Residual\nNetwork (ResNet) with an attention mechanism for spatial features, and a 1D\nConvolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) for temporal features. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generality of DGSense, we evaluated on WiFi gesture\nrecognition, Millimeter Wave (mmWave) activity recognition, and acoustic fall\ndetection. All the systems exhibited high generalization capability to unseen\ndomains, including new users, locations, and environments, free of new data and\nretraining.",

Identifying adjuvant\nnames from cancer vaccine studies is essential for furthering research and\nenhancing immunotherapies. However, the manual curation from the constantly\nexpanding biomedical literature poses significant challenges. This study\nexplores the automated recognition of vaccine adjuvant names using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), specifically Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT)\nand Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama). Methods: We utilized two datasets: 97\nclinical trial records from AdjuvareDB and 290 abstracts annotated with the\nVaccine Adjuvant Compendium (VAC). GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 were employed in\nzero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms with up to four examples per prompt.\nPrompts explicitly targeted adjuvant names, testing the impact of contextual\ninformation such as substances or interventions. Outputs underwent automated\nand manual validation for accuracy and consistency. Results: GPT-4o attained\n100% Precision across all situations while exhibiting notable improve in Recall\nand F1-scores, particularly with incorporating interventions. On the VAC\ndataset, GPT-4o achieved a maximum F1-score of 77.32% with interventions,\nsurpassing Llama-3.2-3B by approximately 2%. On the AdjuvareDB dataset, GPT-4o\nreached an F1-score of 81.67% for three-shot prompting with interventions,\nsurpassing Llama-3.2-3 B's maximum F1-score of 65.62%. Conclusion: Our findings\ndemonstrate that LLMs excel at identifying adjuvant names, including rare\nvariations of naming representation. This study emphasizes the capability of\nLLMs to enhance cancer vaccine development by efficiently extracting insights.\nFuture work aims to broaden the framework to encompass various biomedical\nliterature and enhance model generalizability across various vaccines and\nadjuvants.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Force Matching (ForM), a novel framework for generative\nmodeling that represents an initial exploration into leveraging special\nrelativistic mechanics to enhance the stability of the sampling process. By\nincorporating the Lorentz factor, ForM imposes a velocity constraint, ensuring\nthat sample velocities remain bounded within a constant limit. This constraint\nserves as a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing the generative dynamics,\nleading to a more robust and controlled sampling process. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical analysis demonstrating that the velocity constraint is preserved\nthroughout the sampling procedure within the ForM framework. To validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations. On\nthe \\textit{half-moons} dataset, ForM significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods, achieving the lowest Euclidean distance loss of \\textbf{0.714}, in\ncontrast to vanilla first-order flow matching (5.853) and first- and\nsecond-order flow matching (5.793). Additionally, we perform an ablation study\nto further investigate the impact of our velocity constraint, reaffirming the\nsuperiority of ForM in stabilizing the generative process. The theoretical\nguarantees and empirical results underscore the potential of integrating\nspecial relativity principles into generative modeling. Our findings suggest\nthat ForM provides a promising pathway toward achieving stable, efficient, and\nflexible generative processes.

    "abstract": "This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance\nsegmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable\nof segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and\nunlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed\ndistributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently\nimbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an\ninstance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and\nclass-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes\ninstance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD.\nThe reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail\nclasses when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from\nGCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage\ndiverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable\npseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft\nattention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD.

Existing multimodal diffusion finetuning methods largely focus on\npixel-level reconstruction rather than in-context reasoning, and are\nconstrained by the complexity and limited availability of reasoning-based\ndatasets. ThinkDiff addresses these challenges by leveraging vision-language\ntraining as a proxy task, aligning VLMs with the decoder of an encoder-decoder\nlarge language model (LLM) instead of a diffusion decoder. This proxy task\nbuilds on the observation that the $\\textbf{LLM decoder}$ shares the same input\nfeature space with $\\textbf{diffusion decoders}$ that use the corresponding\n$\\textbf{LLM encoder}$ for prompt embedding. As a result, aligning VLMs with\ndiffusion decoders can be simplified through alignment with the LLM decoder.\nWithout complex training and datasets, ThinkDiff effectively unleashes\nunderstanding, reasoning, and composing capabilities in diffusion models.\nExperiments demonstrate that ThinkDiff significantly improves accuracy from\n19.2% to 46.3% on the challenging CoBSAT benchmark for multimodal in-context\nreasoning generation, with only 5 hours of training on 4 A100 GPUs.\nAdditionally, ThinkDiff demonstrates exceptional performance in composing\nmultiple images and texts into logically coherent images.

However, existing methods are limited by their\nunidirectional nature, requiring separate models for forward and reverse\ntranslations. This not only doubles the computational cost but also restricts\ntheir practicality. In this work, we introduce the Bidirectional Diffusion\nBridge Model (BDBM), a scalable approach that facilitates bidirectional\ntranslation between two coupled distributions using a single network. BDBM\nleverages the Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation for bridges, enabling it to model\ndata distribution shifts across timesteps in both forward and backward\ndirections by exploiting the interchangeability of the initial and target\ntimesteps within this framework. Notably, when the marginal distribution given\nendpoints is Gaussian, BDBM's transition kernels in both directions possess\nanalytical forms, allowing for efficient learning with a single network. We\ndemonstrate the connection between BDBM and existing bridge methods, such as\nDoob's h-transform and variational approaches, and highlight its advantages.\nExtensive experiments on high-resolution I2I translation tasks demonstrate that\nBDBM not only enables bidirectional translation with minimal additional cost\nbut also outperforms state-of-the-art bridge models.

This paper proposes an explanation enhanced\nhallucination-detection model, coined as HuDEx, aimed at enhancing the\nreliability of LLM-generated responses by both detecting hallucinations and\nproviding detailed explanations. The proposed model provides a novel approach\nto integrate detection with explanations, and enable both users and the LLM\nitself to understand and reduce errors. Our measurement results demonstrate\nthat the proposed model surpasses larger LLMs, such as Llama3 70B and GPT-4, in\nhallucination detection accuracy, while maintaining reliable explanations.\nFurthermore, the proposed model performs well in both zero-shot and other test\nenvironments, showcasing its adaptability across diverse benchmark datasets.\nThe proposed approach further enhances the hallucination detection research by\nintroducing a novel approach to integrating interpretability with hallucination\ndetection, which further enhances the performance and reliability of evaluating\nhallucinations in language models.",

The generation of token sequences is the key module in\nexisting tokenized GTs which transforms the input graph into token sequences,\nfacilitating the node representation learning via Transformer. In this paper,\nwe observe that the generations of token sequences in existing GTs only focus\non the first-order neighbors on the constructed similarity graphs, which leads\nto the limited usage of nodes to generate diverse token sequences, further\nrestricting the potential of tokenized GTs for node classification. To this\nend, we propose a new method termed SwapGT.

Then, SwapGT leverages a Transformer-based backbone to learn\nnode representations from the generated token sequences.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). However, its vast potential remains largely\nunexplored for graphs. This raises an interesting question: How can we design\nCoT prompting for graphs to guide graph models to learn step by step? On one\nhand, unlike natural languages, graphs are non-linear and characterized by\ncomplex topological structures. On the other hand, many graphs lack textual\ndata, making it difficult to formulate language-based CoT prompting. In this\nwork, we propose the first CoT prompt learning framework for text-free graphs,\nGCoT. Specifically, we decompose the adaptation process for each downstream\ntask into a series of inference steps, with each step consisting of\nprompt-based inference, ``thought'' generation, and thought-conditioned prompt\nlearning. While the steps mimic CoT prompting in NLP, the exact mechanism\ndiffers significantly. Specifically, at each step, an input graph, along with a\nprompt, is first fed into a pre-trained graph encoder for prompt-based\ninference. We then aggregate the hidden layers of the encoder to construct a\n``thought'', which captures the working state of each node in the current step.\nConditioned on this thought, we learn a prompt specific to each node based on\nthe current state. These prompts are fed into the next inference step,\nrepeating the cycle. To evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of GCoT, we\nconduct comprehensive experiments on eight public datasets, which demonstrate\nthe advantage of our approach.",

As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with significant\nruntime improvements ranging from $33.6\\times$ to $523.6\\times$ over\nstate-of-the-art heuristic samplers.

We propose AdaSeek, an adaptive hierarchical search\nalgorithm for autotuning gen-AI workflows. AdaSeek organizes workflow tuning\nmethods into different layers based on the user-specified total search budget\nand distributes the budget across different layers based on the complexity of\neach layer. During its hierarchical search, AdaSeek redistributes the search\nbudget from less useful to more promising tuning configurations based on\nworkflow-level evaluation results. We implement AdaSeek in a workflow\nautotuning framework called Cognify and evaluate Cognify using six types of\nworkflows such as RAG-based QA and text-to-SQL transformation.

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning enables collaborative training of models across\nnaturally distributed data without centralized coordination or maintenance of a\nglobal model. Instead, devices are organized in arbitrary communication\ntopologies, in which they can only communicate with neighboring devices. Each\ndevice maintains its own local model by training on its local data and\nintegrating new knowledge via model aggregation with neighbors. Therefore,\nknowledge is propagated across the topology via successive aggregation rounds.\nWe study, in particular, the propagation of out-of-distribution (OOD)\nknowledge. We find that popular decentralized learning algorithms struggle to\npropagate OOD knowledge effectively to all devices. Further, we find that both\nthe location of OOD data within a topology, and the topology itself,\nsignificantly impact OOD knowledge propagation. We then propose topology-aware\naggregation strategies to accelerate (OOD) knowledge propagation across\ndevices. These strategies improve OOD data accuracy, compared to\ntopology-unaware baselines, by 123% on average across models in a topology.",

    "abstract": "It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic\nactivations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations\nare composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we\nfind that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying \"true\nfeatures\" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features,\nthe SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying\nmonosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true.\nThis phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction\nloss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the\nproblem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and\nempirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one\nof the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines.\nFinally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved\nvariant of matryoshka SAEs.

Control barrier functions (CBFs) are\na popular method for appending safety guarantees to a general control\nframework, but they are notoriously difficult to generate beyond low\ndimensions. Existing methods often yield non-differentiable or inaccurate\napproximations that lack integrity, and thus fail to ensure safety. In this\nwork, we use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to generate smooth\napproximations of CBFs by computing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) optimal control\nsolutions. These reachability barrier networks (RBNs) avoid traditional\ndimensionality constraints and support the tuning of their conservativeness\npost-training through a parameterized discount term. To ensure robustness of\nthe discounted solutions, we leverage conformal prediction methods to derive\nprobabilistic safety guarantees for RBNs. We demonstrate that RBNs are highly\naccurate in low dimensions, and safer than the standard neural CBF approach in\nhigh dimensions. Namely, we showcase the RBNs in a 9D multi-vehicle collision\navoidance problem where it empirically proves to be 5.5x safer and 1.9x less\nconservative than the neural CBFs, offering a promising method to synthesize\nCBFs for general nonlinear autonomous systems.",

Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense\nneural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete\nforecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential\n``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships\nwithin the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against\npost-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional\ndense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that\nexclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the\nPangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based\npost-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural\nnetworks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather\ninitialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS\nin the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters.

    "abstract": "Recently, training-free methods for improving large language models (LLMs)\nhave attracted growing interest, with token-level attention tuning emerging as\na promising and interpretable direction. However, existing methods typically\nrely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific\ntokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,\nwe uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial\ntoken is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model\nbehavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's\nattention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent\ntokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,\nwe find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more\neffectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a\nconsistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but\nvaries across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct\npreferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we\npropose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by\napplying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite\ntuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text\nclassification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across\nmodels such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves\nLlama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its\nmulti-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited\nresources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies,\nand prompt variations.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs)\nduring downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and\nsimplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple\nsampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues\nthat limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility\nof eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation.\nSpecifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned\nconfidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between\ntheir predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our\ndistillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of\nan additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves\nN-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the\nnumber of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training\ndata can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation\ntechnique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than)\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.",

To this\nend, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm\nthat generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity\nparameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute\nbudgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that\ndynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling\nbehavior.

    "abstract": "The m-out-of-n bootstrap, originally proposed by Bickel, Gotze, and Zwet\n(1992), approximates the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing m\nsubsamples (with m much smaller than n) without replacement from an original\nsample of size n. It is now routinely used for robust inference with\nheavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications.\nDespite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine\nlearning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the\nm-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.\n  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample\nquantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first\nprove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator\nthat holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance\nparameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by\nconstructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the\nassumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact\nconvergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap\napproximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by\nderiving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics,\nincluding the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of\nergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our\ntheory in modern estimation and learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse\nvisual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot\nlearning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant\nrepresentations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing\ngeneralization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually\ndiverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when\ncombined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in\nenabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual\ndistribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to\nsimpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled\nrepresentation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically\ncomplex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual\nperturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this\napproach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically\nshow significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art\nimitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted\nfrom the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural\nnetwork policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not\nonly visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We\nbelieve that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies\nthat are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities\nand dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

    "abstract": "AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising\nsuggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning\nLLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome\nthese limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that\naligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review\nitself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and\nthe manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality\ntop AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the\nhuman-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the\nhuman-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong\nreviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback.\nOur results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average\nrewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI\nreview systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the\nbest AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail\nof low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving\nthese improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR)\nfunction, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the\nREMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.",

However, existing attacks suffer from limited\neffectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In\nthis work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these\nlimitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the\nrendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source\ncode. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the\nperturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate\nthe task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key\nchallenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values\nand screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate\ngradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to\napproximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the\nreformulated optimization problem.

Second, the actor should\nupdate according to a hypergradient that takes changes in the critic's behavior\ninto account. Computing this hypergradient involves finding an inverse Hessian\nvector product, a process that can be numerically unstable.

Theoretically, we\nprove BLPO converges to (a point that satisfies the necessary conditions for) a\nlocal strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability,\nassuming a linear parametrization of the critic's objective.

    "abstract": "We address the computational and theoretical limitations of existing\ndistributional alignment methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),\nparticularly regarding the estimation of classification performance and\nconfidence without target labels. Current theoretical frameworks for these\nmethods often yield computationally intractable quantities and fail to\nadequately reflect the properties of the alignment algorithms employed. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a\nconfidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that exploits the\nflexibility of decision boundaries induced by Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport\nalignment. The proposed OT score is intuitively interpretable, theoretically\nrigorous, and computationally efficient. It provides principled uncertainty\nestimates for any given set of target pseudo-labels without requiring model\nretraining, and can flexibly adapt to varying degrees of available source\ninformation. Experimental results on standard UDA benchmarks demonstrate that\nclassification accuracy consistently improves by identifying and removing\nlow-confidence predictions, and that OT score significantly outperforms\nexisting confidence metrics across diverse adaptation scenarios.",

With growing interest in multilingual\nprompt engineering over the past two to three years, researchers have explored\nvarious strategies to improve LLMs' performance across languages and NLP tasks.\nBy crafting structured natural language prompts, researchers have successfully\nextracted knowledge from LLMs across different languages, making these\ntechniques an accessible pathway for a broader audience, including those\nwithout deep expertise in machine learning, to harness the capabilities of\nLLMs. In this paper, we survey and categorize different multilingual prompting\ntechniques based on the NLP tasks they address across a diverse set of datasets\nthat collectively span around 250 languages. We further highlight the LLMs\nemployed, present a taxonomy of approaches and discuss potential\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) methods for specific multilingual datasets.\nAdditionally, we derive a range of insights across language families and\nresource levels (high-resource vs. low-resource), including analyses such as\nthe distribution of NLP tasks by language resource type and the frequency of\nprompting methods across different language families.

    "abstract": "When tackling complex problems, humans naturally break them down into\nsmaller, manageable subtasks and adjust their initial plans based on\nobservations. For instance, if you want to make coffee at a friend's place, you\nmight initially plan to grab coffee beans, go to the coffee machine, and pour\nthem into the machine. Upon noticing that the machine is full, you would skip\nthe initial steps and proceed directly to brewing. In stark contrast, state of\nthe art reinforcement learners, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),\nlack such prior knowledge and therefore require significantly more training\nsteps to exhibit comparable adaptive behavior. Thus, a central research\nquestion arises: \\textit{How can we enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents\nto have similar ``human priors'', allowing the agent to learn with fewer\ntraining interactions?} To address this challenge, we propose differentiable\nsymbolic planner (Dylan), a novel framework that integrates symbolic planning\ninto Reinforcement Learning. Dylan serves as a reward model that dynamically\nshapes rewards by leveraging human priors, guiding agents through intermediate\nsubtasks, thus enabling more efficient exploration. Beyond reward shaping,\nDylan can work as a high level planner that composes primitive policies to\ngenerate new behaviors while avoiding common symbolic planner pitfalls such as\ninfinite execution loops. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dylan\nsignificantly improves RL agents' performance and facilitates generalization to\nunseen tasks.",

Recently, spatial-temporal graph neural networks\n(STGNNs) have gained popularity as MTS forecasting methods. However, current\nSTGNNs can only use the finite length of MTS input data due to the\ncomputational complexity. Moreover, they lack the ability to identify similar\npatterns throughout the entire dataset and struggle with data that exhibit\nsparsely and discontinuously distributed correlations among variables over an\nextensive historical period, resulting in only marginal improvements. In this\narticle, we introduce a simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting\n( kNN-MTS) framework, which forecasts with a nearest neighbor retrieval\nmechanism over a large datastore of cached series, using representations from\nthe MTS model for similarity search. This approach requires no additional\ntraining and scales to give the MTS model direct access to the whole dataset at\ntest time, resulting in a highly expressive model that consistently improves\nperformance, and has the ability to extract sparse distributed but similar\npatterns spanning over multivariables from the entire dataset. Furthermore, a\nhybrid spatial-temporal encoder (HSTEncoder) is designed for kNN-MTS which can\ncapture both long-term temporal and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies\nand is shown to provide accurate representation for kNN-MTSfor better\nforecasting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show a\nsignificant improvement in the forecasting performance of kNN-MTS. The\nquantitative analysis also illustrates the interpretability and efficiency of\nkNN-MTS, showing better application prospects and opening up a new path for\nefficiently using the large dataset in MTS models.",

    "abstract": "Benign overfitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model\nperfectly fits (interpolates) the training data, including noisy examples, yet\nstill generalizes well to unseen data. Understanding this phenomenon has\nattracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a\nconceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models\nsimultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This\nbehavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but\nnon-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that\nthis almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by\nanalyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables\nlarger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach\nBayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical\nevidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii)\nleast-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network\ntrained via gradient flow. In both cases, we overcome the strong assumptions\noften required in prior work on benign overfitting.\n  Our results on neural networks also provide the first generalization result\nin this setting that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying\nregression function or noise, beyond boundedness. Our analysis introduces a\nnovel proof technique based on decomposing the excess risk into estimation and\napproximation errors, interpreting gradient flow as an implicit regularizer,\nthat helps avoid uniform convergence traps.

    "abstract": "Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated\nfeatures -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains\na central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same\ntime, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging\nrecent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic\nstructure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their\nvulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token,\nand neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology\nshared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can\nbe exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box\ninstruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These\nfindings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also\npoint to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could\npotentially persist across architectures and training regimes.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and\ncomputational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to\ncapture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent\nadvances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address\nthese drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features.\nHowever, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a\ncontinuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in\nfeature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process;\n2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is\nrarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal\nsubsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1)\npreserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while\nensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space\nwithout relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we\ndevelop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge\ninto a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions\nthrough pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of\nfeature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is\nintroduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second\nobjective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to\nguide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively\nnavigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing\nhigh-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity\nassumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local\noptima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency,\nrobustness and explicitness of our model.",

We show that, despite superficial similarities to human choice\ndistributions, such models differ in subtle but important ways. First, they\nshow much higher susceptibility to the nudges. Second, they diverge in points\nearned, being affected by factors like the idiosyncrasy of available prizes.\nThird, they diverge in information acquisition strategies: e.g. incurring\nsubstantial cost to reveal too much information, or selecting without revealing\nany. Moreover, we show that simple prompt strategies like zero-shot chain of\nthought (CoT) can shift the choice distribution, and few-shot prompting with\nhuman data can induce greater alignment. Yet, none of these methods resolve the\nsensitivity of these models to nudges. Finally, we show how optimal nudges\noptimized with a human resource-rational model can similarly increase LLM\nperformance for some models.

Accurate\nindoor location has numerous applications, such as asset tracking and indoor\nnavigation. Despite advances in WiFi localization techniques -- in particular\napproaches that leverage WiFi telemetry -- their adoption in practice remains\nlimited due to several factors including environmental changes that cause\nsignal fading, multipath effects, interference, which, in turn, impact\npositioning accuracy. In addition, telemetry data differs depending on the WiFi\ndevice vendor, offering distinct features and formats; use case requirements\ncan also vary widely.

    "abstract": "Large multimodal models (LMMs) now excel on many vision language benchmarks,\nhowever, they still struggle with human centered criteria such as fairness,\nethics, empathy, and inclusivity, key to aligning with human values. We\nintroduce HumaniBench, a holistic benchmark of 32K real-world image question\npairs, annotated via a scalable GPT4o assisted pipeline and exhaustively\nverified by domain experts. HumaniBench evaluates seven Human Centered AI\n(HCAI) principles: fairness, ethics, understanding, reasoning, language\ninclusivity, empathy, and robustness, across seven diverse tasks, including\nopen and closed ended visual question answering (VQA), multilingual QA, visual\ngrounding, empathetic captioning, and robustness tests. Benchmarking 15 state\nof the art LMMs (open and closed source) reveals that proprietary models\ngenerally lead, though robustness and visual grounding remain weak points. Some\nopen-source models also struggle to balance accuracy with adherence to\nhuman-aligned principles. HumaniBench is the first benchmark purpose built\naround HCAI principles. It provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing alignment\ngaps and guiding LMMs toward behavior that is both accurate and socially\nresponsible.

    "abstract": "Dates often contribute towards highly impactful medical decisions, but it is\nrarely clear how to extract this data. AI has only just begun to be used\ntranscribe such documents, and common methods are either to trust that the\noutput produced by a complex AI model, or to parse the text using regular\nexpressions. Recent work has established that regular expressions are an\nexplainable form of logic, but it is difficult to decompose these into the\ncomponent parts that are required to construct precise UNIX timestamps. First,\nwe test publicly-available regular expressions, and we found that these were\nunable to capture a significant number of our dates. Next, we manually created\neasily-decomposable regular expressions, and we found that these were able to\ndetect the majority of real dates, but also a lot of sequences of text that\nlook like dates. Finally, we used regular expression synthesis to automatically\nidentify regular expressions from the reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps that\nwe created. We find that regular expressions created by regular expression\nsynthesis detect far fewer sequences of text that look like dates than those\nthat were manually created, at the cost of a slight increase to the number of\nmissed dates. Overall, our results show that regular expressions can be created\nthrough regular expression synthesis to identify complex dates and date ranges\nin text transcriptions. To our knowledge, our proposed way of learning\ndeterministic logic by reverse-engineering several many-one mappings and\nfeeding these into a regular expression synthesiser is a new approach.",

Instead of attacking the most commonly used software and\nmonetizing exploits by targeting the lowest common denominator among victims,\nLLMs enable adversaries to launch tailored attacks on a user-by-user basis. On\nthe exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one\ndifficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find\nthousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on\nthe monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the\nsame attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an\nLLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the\nparticular content of each exploited device.\n  We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical\nusing state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human\nintervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron\nemail dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that\ncould be used for blackmail. While some of our attacks are still too expensive\nto scale widely today, the incentives to implement these attacks will only\nincrease as LLMs get cheaper. Thus, we argue that LLMs create a need for new\ndefense-in-depth approaches.",

Similarly, supervised\nlearning methods require extensive training on annotated datasets, limiting\ntheir adaptability to new tools. Despite their success in other domains,\nzero-shot pose estimation models remain unexplored in RMIS for pose estimation\nof surgical instruments, creating a gap in generalising to unseen surgical\ntools. This paper presents a novel 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) pose estimation\npipeline for surgical instruments, leveraging state-of-the-art zero-shot RGB-D\nmodels like the FoundationPose and SAM-6D. We advanced these models by\nincorporating vision-based depth estimation using the RAFT-Stereo method, for\nrobust depth estimation in reflective and textureless environments.\nAdditionally, we enhanced SAM-6D by replacing its instance segmentation module,\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), with a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN, significantly\nboosting segmentation accuracy in occluded and complex conditions. Extensive\nvalidation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in\nzero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new\nbenchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS.

At the core of the dataset are structured user\nprofiles, each defined by a set of routines - context-triggered, repeatable\npatterns of behavior that govern how users interact with their home systems.\nUsing these profiles as input, a large language model (LLM) generates\ncorresponding interaction sessions that simulate realistic, diverse, and\ncontext-aware dialogues between users and their devices.\n  The primary task supported by this dataset is profile reconstruction:\ninferring user routines and preferences solely from interactions history. To\nassess how well current models can perform this task under realistic\nconditions, we benchmarked several state-of-the-art compact language models and\ncompared their performance against large foundation models. Our results show\nthat while small models demonstrate some capability in reconstructing profiles,\nthey still fall significantly short of large models in accurately capturing\nuser behavior. This performance gap poses a major challenge - particularly\nbecause on-device processing offers critical advantages, such as preserving\nuser privacy, minimizing latency, and enabling personalized experiences without\nreliance on the cloud.

Motivated by this, we propose a new\nparadigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual\nrepresentations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed\nvia sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual\ndomain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a\nnovel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement\nLearning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,\nleading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of\nrepresentative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our\nvisual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct\nreasoning in the text-only space.

We\nidentify two core capabilities necessary for such settings --\n$\\textit{perceptual updating}$ and $\\textit{contingency awareness}$ -- and\npropose a new benchmark task, $\\textbf{Temporally-Grounded Language Generation\n(TGLG)}$, to evaluate them. TGLG requires models to generate utterances in\nresponse to streaming video such that both content and timing align with\ndynamic visual input. To support this benchmark, we curate evaluation datasets\nfrom sports broadcasting and egocentric human interaction domains, and\nintroduce a new metric, $\\textbf{TRACE}$, to evaluate TGLG by jointly measuring\nsemantic similarity and temporal alignment. Finally, we present\n$\\textbf{Vision-Language Model with Time-Synchronized Interleaving (VLM-TSI)}$,\na model that interleaves visual and linguistic tokens in a time-synchronized\nmanner, enabling real-time language generation without relying on turn-based\nassumptions.

Visually confusing or\ncryptic species are groups of two or more taxa that are nearly\nindistinguishable based on visual characteristics alone. While much existing\nwork addresses taxonomic identification in a broad sense, datasets that\ndirectly address the morphological confusion of cryptic species are small,\nmanually curated, and target only a single taxon. Thus, the challenge of\nidentifying such subtle differences in a wide range of taxa remains\nunaddressed. Curated from real-world trends in species misidentification among\ncommunity annotators of iNaturalist, CrypticBio contains 52K unique cryptic\ngroups spanning 67K species, represented in 166 million images. Rich\nresearch-grade image annotations--including scientific, multicultural, and\nmultilingual species terminology, hierarchical taxonomy, spatiotemporal\ncontext, and associated cryptic groups--address multimodal AI in biodiversity\nresearch. For easy dataset curation, we provide an open-source pipeline\nCrypticBio-Curate. The multimodal nature of the dataset beyond vision-language\narises from the integration of geographical and temporal data as complementary\ncues to identifying cryptic species.

Such heterogeneity can significantly distort\nthe optimization dynamics and lead to objective inconsistency, where the global\nmodel converges to an incorrect stationary point potentially far from the\npursued optimum. Despite its critical impact, the joint effect of communication\nand computation heterogeneity has remained largely unexplored, due to the\nintrinsic complexity of their interaction. In this paper, we reveal the\nfundamentally distinct mechanisms through which heterogeneous communication and\ncomputation drive inconsistency in FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first unified theoretical analysis of general heterogeneous FL, offering a\nprincipled understanding of how these two forms of heterogeneity jointly\ndistort the optimization trajectory under arbitrary choices of local solvers.\nMotivated by these insights, we propose Federated Heterogeneity-Aware Client\nSampling, FedACS, a universal method to eliminate all types of objective\ninconsistency.

    "abstract": "The variety of data in data lakes presents significant challenges for data\nanalytics, as data scientists must simultaneously analyze multi-modal data,\nincluding structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities, they still\nremain inadequate for multi-modal data analytics in terms of accuracy,\nefficiency, and freshness. First, current natural language (NL) or SQL-like\nquery languages may struggle to precisely and comprehensively capture users'\nanalytical intent. Second, relying on a single unified LLM to process diverse\ndata modalities often leads to substantial inference overhead. Third, data\nstored in data lakes may be incomplete or outdated, making it essential to\nintegrate external open-domain knowledge to generate timely and relevant\nanalytics results.\n  In this paper, we envision a new multi-modal data analytics system.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel architecture built upon the Model Context\nProtocol (MCP), an emerging paradigm that enables LLMs to collaborate with\nknowledgeable agents. First, we define a semantic operator hierarchy tailored\nfor querying multi-modal data in data lakes and develop an AI-agent-powered\nNL2Operator translator to bridge user intent and analytical execution. Next, we\nintroduce an MCP-based execution framework, in which each MCP server hosts\nspecialized foundation models optimized for specific data modalities. This\ndesign enhances both accuracy and efficiency, while supporting high scalability\nthrough modular deployment. Finally, we propose a updating mechanism by\nharnessing the deep research and machine unlearning techniques to refresh the\ndata lakes and LLM knowledges, with the goal of balancing the data freshness\nand inference efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) representation is fundamentally challenged by\npervasive non-uniformity, where spectral dependencies, spatial continuity, and\nfeature efficiency exhibit complex and often conflicting behaviors. Most\nexisting models rely on a unified processing paradigm that assumes homogeneity\nacross dimensions, leading to suboptimal performance and biased\nrepresentations. To address this, we propose FairHyp, a fairness-directed\nframework that explicitly disentangles and resolves the threefold\nnon-uniformity through cooperative yet specialized modules. We introduce a\nRunge-Kutta-inspired spatial variability adapter to restore spatial coherence\nunder resolution discrepancies, a multi-receptive field convolution module with\nsparse-aware refinement to enhance discriminative features while respecting\ninherent sparsity, and a spectral-context state space model that captures\nstable and long-range spectral dependencies via bidirectional Mamba scanning\nand statistical aggregation. Unlike one-size-fits-all solutions, FairHyp\nachieves dimension-specific adaptation while preserving global consistency and\nmutual reinforcement. This design is grounded in the view that non-uniformity\narises from the intrinsic structure of HSI representations, rather than any\nparticular task setting. To validate this, we apply FairHyp across four\nrepresentative tasks including classification, denoising, super-resolution, and\ninpaintin, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling a shared structural\nflaw. Extensive experiments show that FairHyp consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods under varied imaging conditions.

    "abstract": "Neural networks are often black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge\nof understanding their internal workings. We propose a different perspective\nthat challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural\nnetworks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror\nregularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection\nHypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on\nthis insight, we propose to leverage cognitively-inspired methods of chunking\nto segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units\nthat reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract these\nemerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and\ndimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of\nentities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond\nto known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels\nare absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting\nentities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in\nRNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with\ndiverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods.\nThroughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities\nand concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities\nin neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated\nconcepts. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that\nharnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to\nreveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually\ntransforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.",

    "abstract": "The development of reasoning capabilities represents a critical frontier in\nlarge language models (LLMs) research, where reinforcement learning (RL) and\nprocess reward models (PRMs) have emerged as predominant methodological\nframeworks. Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from\nDeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical\nproblem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM\nintegration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In\nthis study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between\nRL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving\nproficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary\ndimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training.\nIn particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting\nwhen applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To\naddress this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in\nwhich models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through\nself-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of\nthe benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes\npersistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\\%) on difficult\nproblems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses\nunderscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and\nintrospective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be\nessential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves\nproblem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We\nhope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and\nself-aware complex reasoning models.",

Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS\nSystem evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies,\nand limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a\nmulti-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles,\ncontext diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in\nChinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio\nTuring Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired\nwith a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on\ncomplex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge\nwhether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and\nimproves evaluation robustness.

    "abstract": "This work presents a user-centric recommendation framework, designed as a\npipeline with four distinct, connected, and customizable phases. These phases\nare intended to improve explainability and boost user engagement.\n  We have collected the historical Last.fm track playback records of a single\nuser over approximately 15 years. The collected dataset includes more than\n90,000 playbacks and approximately 14,000 unique tracks.\n  From track playback records, we have created a dataset of user temporal\ncontexts (each row is a specific moment when the user listened to certain music\ndescriptors). As music descriptors, we have used community-contributed Last.fm\ntags and Spotify audio features. They represent the music that, throughout\nyears, the user has been listening to.\n  Next, given the most relevant Last.fm tags of a moment (e.g. the hour of the\nday), we predict the Spotify audio features that best fit the user preferences\nin that particular moment. Finally, we use the predicted audio features to find\ntracks similar to these features. The final aim is to recommend (and discover)\ntracks that the user may feel like listening to at a particular moment.\n  For our initial study case, we have chosen to predict only a single audio\nfeature target: danceability. The framework, however, allows to include more\ntarget variables.\n  The ability to learn the musical habits from a single user can be quite\npowerful, and this framework could be extended to other users.",

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning\nmodels capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model\ngeneralization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable\ncandidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: Foundation Models (FMs)\nprovide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas\nFederated Learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed,\nprivacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization.

However, current XAI tools, built for simpler models,\nstruggle to handle the non-numerical nature of large language models (LLMs).\nThis paper examines the effectiveness of global XAI methods, such as\nrule-extraction algorithms and SHAP, in detecting bias in LLMs. To do so, we\nfirst show a text-to-ordinal mapping strategy to convert non-numerical\ninputs/outputs into numerical features, enabling these tools to identify (some)\nmisinformation-related biases in LLM-generated content. Then, we inject\nnon-linear biases of varying complexity (univariate, conjunctive, and\nnon-convex) into widespread LLMs like ChatGPT and Llama via system\ninstructions, using global XAI methods to detect them. This way, we found that\nRuleFit struggles with conjunctive and non-convex biases, while SHAP can\napproximate conjunctive biases but cannot express them as actionable rules.\nHence, we introduce RuleSHAP, a global rule extraction algorithm combining SHAP\nand RuleFit to detect more non-univariate biases, improving injected bias\ndetection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average.",

Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by two-tiered\nlimitations: (1) Neither instance- nor cluster-level consistency learning\nconstruct a semantic space shared across views to learn consensus semantics.\nThe former enforces cross-view instances alignment, and wrongly regards\nunpaired observations with semantic consistency as negative pairs; the latter\nfocuses on cross-view cluster counterparts while coarsely handling fine-grained\nintra-cluster relationships within views.

Our benchmark is\nremarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation\nsubjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships.

To address these limitations, we propose\na framework named $\\textbf{S}$h$\\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\\textbf{Lo}$ng\n$\\textbf{P}$reference $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling\nlong-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO\nand short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and\nempirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs\nsampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge\nutilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score\nconsistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and\nlong contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This\nfacilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into\nlong-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference\noptimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data\nconstruction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO\nenhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain\ngeneralization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while\nachieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Timely prediction of students at high risk of dropout is critical for early\nintervention and improving educational outcomes. However, in offline\neducational settings, poor data quality, limited scale, and high heterogeneity\noften hinder the application of advanced machine learning models. Furthermore,\nwhile educational theories provide valuable insights into dropout phenomena,\nthe lack of quantifiable metrics for key indicators limits their use in\ndata-driven modeling. Through data analysis and a review of educational\nliterature, we identified abrupt changes in student behavior as key early\nsignals of dropout risk. To address this, we propose the Dual-Modal Multiscale\nSliding Window (DMSW) Model, which integrates academic performance and\nbehavioral data to dynamically capture behavior patterns using minimal data.\nThe DMSW model improves prediction accuracy by 15% compared to traditional\nmethods, enabling educators to identify high-risk students earlier, provide\ntimely support, and foster a more inclusive learning environment. Our analysis\nhighlights key behavior patterns, offering practical insights for preventive\nstrategies and tailored support. These findings bridge the gap between theory\nand practice in dropout prediction, giving educators an innovative tool to\nenhance student retention and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is critical, particularly in\nhigh-stakes domains where biased decisions can lead to serious societal\nconsequences. Existing preprocessing approaches generally lack transparent\nmechanisms for identifying which features or instances are responsible for\nunfairness. This obscures the rationale behind data modifications. We introduce\nFairSHAP, a novel pre-processing framework that leverages Shapley value\nattribution to improve both individual and group fairness. FairSHAP identifies\nfairness-critical instances in the training data using an interpretable measure\nof feature importance, and systematically modifies them through instance-level\nmatching across sensitive groups. This process reduces discriminative risk - an\nindividual fairness metric - while preserving data integrity and model\naccuracy. We demonstrate that FairSHAP significantly improves demographic\nparity and equality of opportunity across diverse tabular datasets, achieving\nfairness gains with minimal data perturbation and, in some cases, improved\npredictive performance. As a model-agnostic and transparent method, FairSHAP\nintegrates seamlessly into existing machine learning pipelines and provides\nactionable insights into the sources of bias.Our code is on\nhttps://github.com/youlei202/FairSHAP.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the power\nof reasoning through self-generated chains of thought. Multiple reasoning\nagents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual\noutcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner,\ntrading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group\nThink--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or\nthinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress,\nGroup Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple\nreasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For\nexample, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon\ndetecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This\nfine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant\nreasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency.\nMoreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle\ncomputational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference,\nwhere very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs. We give a simple\nand generalizable modification that enables any existing LLM to perform Group\nThink on a local GPU. We also present an evaluation strategy to benchmark\nreasoning latency and empirically demonstrate latency improvements using\nopen-source LLMs that were not explicitly trained for Group Think. We hope this\nwork paves the way for future LLMs to exhibit more sophisticated and more\nefficient collaborative behavior for higher quality generation.",

In addition, BiDist operates as a\nconcise and efficient solution without the need for the complex and costly\nstorage of past policies.

Our results highlight its\nremarkable generalization ability across a variety of cooperative, competitive,\nand social dilemma tasks, and reveal that BiDist significantly diversifies the\npolicy distribution space.

Conventional methods demand a\nconfluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning,\nand/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary\nLarge Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for\ndevice selection in a wireless FL environment.

To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a\nsample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the\nrelationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating\nsubsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces\nreliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while\nmaintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the\ndiscrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the\nadvantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably\nsmall deviation from real-world conditions.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GPO is effective across various diffusion models and tasks.\nSpecifically, combining with widely used computer vision models, such as YOLO\nand OCR, the GPO improves the accurate counting and text rendering capabilities\nof the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium by 20 percentage points. Notably, as a\nplug-and-play method, no extra overhead is introduced during inference.",

    "abstract": "Analog in-memory computing is a next-generation computing paradigm that\npromises fast, parallel, and energy-efficient deep learning training and\ntransfer learning (TL). However, achieving this promise has remained elusive\ndue to a lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit\nasymmetric and non-linear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device\nvariation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training\nalgorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Also, recently introduced\nalgorithms have enjoyed limited attention, as they require bi-directionally\nswitching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly\nsensitive. A new algorithm chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which\nleverages the chopped technique to address many of the challenges mentioned\nabove. In this paper, we assess the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for\nanalog TL using a Swin-ViT model on a subset of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also\ninvestigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device\nspecifications, including weight transfer noise, symmetry point skew, and\nsymmetry point variability",

The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral\ntrajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can\nintroduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may\ntrigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address\nthe safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we\npropose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing\na lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each\nhigh-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected\nthought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions\nand tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning\nphase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy\nand widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner\nmodel, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios\nand simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse\ninstructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is\nfine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three\nagent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that\nThought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the\nunprotected setting to 90% on average.

To identify these biases, methods that interpret high-level,\nhuman-understandable concepts are more effective than those relying primarily\non low-level features like heatmaps. A major challenge for these concept-based\nmethods is the lack of image annotations indicating potentially bias-inducing\nconcepts, since creating such annotations requires detailed labeling for each\ndataset and concept, which is highly labor-intensive. We present CUBIC (Concept\nembeddings for Unsupervised Bias IdentifiCation), a novel method that\nautomatically discovers interpretable concepts that may bias classifier\nbehavior. Unlike existing approaches, CUBIC does not rely on predefined bias\ncandidates or examples of model failures tied to specific biases, as such\ninformation is not always available. Instead, it leverages image-text latent\nspace and linear classifier probes to examine how the latent representation of\na superclass label$\\unicode{x2014}$shared by all instances in the\ndataset$\\unicode{x2014}$is influenced by the presence of a given concept. By\nmeasuring these shifts against the normal vector to the classifier's decision\nboundary, CUBIC identifies concepts that significantly influence model\npredictions.

Their expressive power is intimately related\nto logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for\nrecurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or\nsuffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a\nhalting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can\nexpress all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for\nthe standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. A recent\nbreakthrough in the study of the expressivity of graded modal mu-calculus in\nthe finite suggests that conversely, restricted to node classifiers definable\nin monadic second-order logic, recurrent GNNs can express only node classifiers\ndefinable in graded modal mu-calculus. To prove our main result, we develop a\nnew approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of\nindependent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking\nalgorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size.\nIn a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a\nhalting recurrent GNN.",

The core idea is to incentivize the\nguard model to deliberatively reason before making moderation decisions via\nonline RL. First, we construct GuardReasoner-VLTrain, a reasoning corpus with\n123K samples and 631K reasoning steps, spanning text, image, and text-image\ninputs. Then, based on it, we cold-start our model's reasoning ability via SFT.\nIn addition, we further enhance reasoning regarding moderation through online\nRL. Concretely, to enhance diversity and difficulty of samples, we conduct\nrejection sampling followed by data augmentation via the proposed safety-aware\ndata concatenation. Besides, we use a dynamic clipping parameter to encourage\nexploration in early stages and exploitation in later stages. To balance\nperformance and token efficiency, we design a length-aware safety reward that\nintegrates accuracy, format, and token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superiority of our model. Remarkably, it surpasses the runner-up by 19.27%\nF1 score on average.

Despite this, humans can effortlessly\nhandle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing\nresearch in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity,\nprimarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment\nmanipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment\nspecifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,\nwhich features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and\nrefines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the\nsim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or\ntraining expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive\nand inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence\nto automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a\nsingle expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention.\nHowever, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of\ngarments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve\ngeneralization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a\nHierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies\ntransferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then\ngenerates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive\nexperiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate\nthat HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing\nto previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and\ndeformation where others fail.

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, and the\nmethods based on frequency domain analysis have become an important branch.\nHowever, most existing studies focus on the design of elaborate model\narchitectures and are often tailored for limited datasets, still lacking\nuniversality. Besides, the assumption of independent and identically\ndistributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time\ndomain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we\npropose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional\nfrequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we\nfirst prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its\nspectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus\ncan provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet\nTransform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the\ntime series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency\nvariations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss\nbetween predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain.\nMoreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced\nforecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original\narchitectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting\nperformance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7%\non short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality. The code\nwill be released publicly.",

Subjects who\nplay the zero Nash-equilibrium choice motivate their strategy by appealing to\nperceived LLM's reasoning ability and, unexpectedly, propensity towards\ncooperation.

Some studies\nargue that it is merely the result of memorizing vast amounts of data, while\nothers contend that it reflects a fundamental, symbolic algorithmic development\nin LMs. In this work, we introduce a suite of investigative tasks and a novel\nmethod to systematically investigate ICL by leveraging the full Pythia scaling\nsuite, including interim checkpoints that capture progressively larger amount\nof training data. By carefully exploring ICL performance on downstream tasks\nand simultaneously conducting a mechanistic analysis of the residual stream's\nsubspace, we demonstrate that ICL extends beyond mere \"memorization\" of the\ntraining corpus, yet does not amount to the implementation of an independent\nsymbolic algorithm. Our results also clarify several aspects of ICL, including\nthe influence of training dynamics, model capabilities, and elements of\nmechanistic interpretability.

Formal approaches to XAI use a formal model of the AI\nsystem to identify abductive explanations. While abductive explanations may be\napplicable to a large number of inputs sharing the same concrete values, more\ngeneral explanations may be preferred for numeric inputs. So-called inflated\nabductive explanations give intervals for each feature ensuring that any input\nwhose values fall withing these intervals is still guaranteed to make the same\nprediction.

This hierarchical structure\neffectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step\neffectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We\nevaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using\nQwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers\nfine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\\%\non ALFWorld and > 9\\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining\nthe same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no\nadditional time cost.",

However,\napplying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to\ncontinuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse\nterrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GRoQ-Loco, a\nscalable, attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion\npolicy across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline\ndatasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct\nlocomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain\ntraversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to\ntrain a generalist model that enables behavior fusion for both behaviors.\nCrucially, our framework operates directly on proprioceptive data from all\nrobots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is\ndirectly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs\nwithout any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nstrong zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains,\nincluding hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg\nrobot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where\ndifferent locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe\nsuccessful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all\nrobots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg\nquadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning.\nThese results highlight the potential for robust generalist locomotion across\ndiverse robots and terrains.",

However, commonly used Graph\nNeural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex\nstructural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational\ndata. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on\ngeneral graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique\nchallenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive,\nheterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal\ndynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization\nschemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational\nGraph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed\nspecifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element\ntokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features,\ntype, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of\nheterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our\narchitecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global\nattention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide\nrepresentations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT\nconsistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing\nGraph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.",

    "abstract": "Recently, AI-driven interactions with computing devices have advanced from\nbasic prototype tools to sophisticated, LLM-based systems that emulate\nhuman-like operations in graphical user interfaces. We are now witnessing the\nemergence of \\emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously\nperforming tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile\napps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel\nsafety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the\nadded complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal\ninputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a\nsystematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We\nconduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four\nresearch objectives: \\textit{\\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety\nanalysis; \\textit{\\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs;\n\\textit{\\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive\nstrategies; \\textit{\\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets,\nand evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs.\nBuilding on these insights, our work provides future researchers with a\nstructured foundation for exploring unexplored vulnerabilities and offers\npractitioners actionable guidance in designing and deploying secure\nComputer-Using Agents.",

    "abstract": "Planning trips is a cognitively intensive task involving conflicting user\npreferences, dynamic external information, and multi-step temporal-spatial\noptimization. Traditional platforms often fall short - they provide static\nresults, lack contextual adaptation, and fail to support real-time interaction\nor intent refinement.\n  Our approach, Vaiage, addresses these challenges through a graph-structured\nmulti-agent framework built around large language models (LLMs) that serve as\nboth goal-conditioned recommenders and sequential planners. LLMs infer user\nintent, suggest personalized destinations and activities, and synthesize\nitineraries that align with contextual constraints such as budget, timing,\ngroup size, and weather. Through natural language interaction, structured tool\nuse, and map-based feedback loops, Vaiage enables adaptive, explainable, and\nend-to-end travel planning grounded in both symbolic reasoning and\nconversational understanding.\n  To evaluate Vaiage, we conducted human-in-the-loop experiments using\nrubric-based GPT-4 assessments and qualitative feedback. The full system\nachieved an average score of 8.5 out of 10, outperforming the no-strategy (7.2)\nand no-external-API (6.8) variants, particularly in feasibility. Qualitative\nanalysis indicated that agent coordination - especially the Strategy and\nInformation Agents - significantly improved itinerary quality by optimizing\ntime use and integrating real-time context. These results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with symbolic agent coordination in\nopen-ended, real-world planning tasks.",

Although\nrecent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing\nperformance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward.\nHowever, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots\noften contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness\nfrequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend\nheavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more\nprevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This\npaper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects\nLLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we\npropose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench),\nwhere we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning\nperformance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that\nmost failure cases stem from missing objects in planners.

Such misalignment results in suboptimal\nretrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval\n(SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce\npotential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by\nabstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These\ninduced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval\neffectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$), a\nmethod that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether\nthe abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts\nin the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning.

Moreover, we propose an adaptive adjustment strategy\nfor our unlearning penalty coefficient to adaptively balance forgetting quality\nand predictive performance during training, eliminating the need for empirical\nhyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional MU methods that identify only a\nsingle unlearning model, MCU uncovers a spectrum of unlearning models along the\npathway. Overall, MCU serves as a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly\nintegrates with any existing MU methods, consistently improving unlearning\nefficacy. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate\nthat MCU achieves superior performance.",

However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete\ndata points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in\nparticularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by\nemploying implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions\nfor time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous\nfunctions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling\nfrequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on\nextremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight\ndatasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation\nperformance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series\ndata. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values\nin healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis\ntasks. Codes are available.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Ready2Unlearn, a learning-time optimization approach\ndesigned to facilitate future unlearning processes. Unlike the majority of\nexisting unlearning efforts that focus on designing unlearning algorithms,\nwhich are typically implemented reactively when an unlearning request is made\nduring the model deployment phase, Ready2Unlearn shifts the focus to the\ntraining phase, adopting a \"forward-looking\" perspective. Building upon\nwell-established meta-learning principles, Ready2Unlearn proactively trains\nmachine learning models with unlearning readiness, such that they are well\nprepared and can handle future unlearning requests in a more efficient and\nprincipled manner. Ready2Unlearn is model-agnostic and compatible with any\ngradient ascent-based machine unlearning algorithms. We evaluate the method on\nboth vision and language tasks under various unlearning settings, including\nclass-wise unlearning and random data unlearning. Experimental results show\nthat by incorporating such preparedness at training time, Ready2Unlearn\nproduces an unlearning-ready model state, which offers several key advantages\nwhen future unlearning is required, including reduced unlearning time, improved\nretention of overall model capability, and enhanced resistance to the\ninadvertent recovery of forgotten data.

This paper presents an architecture for a general user model\n(GUM) that learns about you by observing any interaction you have with your\ncomputer. The GUM takes as input any unstructured observation of a user (e.g.,\ndevice screenshots) and constructs confidence-weighted propositions that\ncapture user knowledge and preferences. GUMs can infer that a user is preparing\nfor a wedding they're attending from messages with a friend. Or recognize that\na user is struggling with a collaborator's feedback on a draft by observing\nmultiple stalled edits and a switch to reading related work. GUMs introduce an\narchitecture that infers new propositions about a user from multimodal\nobservations, retrieves related propositions for context, and continuously\nrevises existing propositions. To illustrate the breadth of applications that\nGUMs enable, we demonstrate how they augment chat-based assistants with\ncontext, manage OS notifications to selectively surface important information,\nand enable interactive agents that adapt to preferences across apps. We also\ninstantiate proactive assistants (GUMBOs) that discover and execute useful\nsuggestions on a user's behalf using their GUM. In our evaluations, we find\nthat GUMs make calibrated and accurate inferences about users, and that\nassistants built on GUMs proactively identify and perform actions that users\nwouldn't think to request explicitly.

    "abstract": "This work addresses the task of completely weakly supervised\nclass-incremental learning for semantic segmentation to learn segmentation for\nboth base and additional novel classes using only image-level labels. While\nclass-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) is crucial for handling diverse\nand newly emerging objects in the real world, traditional CISS methods require\nexpensive pixel-level annotations for training. To overcome this limitation,\npartially weakly-supervised approaches have recently been proposed. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a completely\nweakly-supervised method for CISS. To achieve this, we propose to generate\nrobust pseudo-labels by combining pseudo-labels from a localizer and a sequence\nof foundation models based on their uncertainty. Moreover, to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting, we introduce an exemplar-guided data augmentation\nmethod that generates diverse images containing both previous and novel classes\nwith guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments in three common experimental\nsettings: 15-5 VOC, 10-10 VOC, and COCO-to-VOC, and in two scenarios: disjoint\nand overlap. The experimental results demonstrate that our completely weakly\nsupervised method outperforms even partially weakly supervised methods in the\n15-5 VOC and 10-10 VOC settings while achieving competitive accuracy in the\nCOCO-to-VOC setting.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials are vital for evaluation of safety and efficacy of new\ntreatments. However, clinical trials are resource-intensive, time-consuming and\nexpensive to conduct, where errors in trial design, reduced efficacy, and\nsafety events can result in significant delays, financial losses, and damage to\nreputation. These risks underline the importance of informed and strategic\ndecisions in trial design to mitigate these risks and improve the chances of a\nsuccessful trial. Identifying similar historical trials is critical as these\ntrials can provide an important reference for potential pitfalls and challenges\nincluding serious adverse events, dosage inaccuracies, recruitment\ndifficulties, patient adherence issues, etc. Addressing these challenges in\ntrial design can lead to development of more effective study protocols with\noptimized patient safety and trial efficiency. In this paper, we present a\nnovel method to identify similar historical trials by summarizing clinical\ntrial protocols and searching for similar trials based on a query trial's\nprotocol. Our approach significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving up to\na 78% improvement in recall@1 and a 53% improvement in precision@1 over the\nbest baseline. We also show that our method outperforms all other baselines in\npartial trial similarity search and zero-shot patient-trial matching,\nhighlighting its superior utility in these tasks.",

    "abstract": "Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in\npreventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains\npoorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety\nfine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model\nactivations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise\nraises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety\nfine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought\nreasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities\nin current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of\nreasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction\nfor developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important\nimplications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications\nas these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even\nwithout adversarial prompts.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy\nmarkets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods\nstruggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the\nprobabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either\nemploy shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on\ndeterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation\nparadigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic\nmultimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed\nabstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal\npatterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual\ncontexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal\nrepresentations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen\nLLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs'\ninherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series\nforecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of\nCAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights\nits robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.",

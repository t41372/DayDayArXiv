To facilitate\nDSA designs, programmers use high-level synthesis (HLS) to compile a high-level\ndescription written in C/C++ into a design with low-level hardware description\nlanguages that eventually synthesize DSAs on circuits. However, creating a\nhigh-quality HLS design still demands significant domain knowledge,\nparticularly in microarchitecture decisions expressed as \\textit{pragmas}.\nThus, it is desirable to automate such decisions with the help of machine\nlearning for predicting the quality of HLS designs, requiring a deeper\nunderstanding of the program that consists of original code and pragmas.\nNaturally, these programs can be considered as sequence data. In addition,\nthese programs can be compiled and converted into a control data flow graph\n(CDFG). But existing works either fail to leverage both modalities or combine\nthe two in shallow or coarse ways. We propose ProgSG, a model that allows\ninteraction between the source code sequence modality and the graph modality in\na deep and fine-grained way. To alleviate the scarcity of labeled designs, a\npre-training method is proposed based on a suite of compiler's data flow\nanalysis tasks. Experimental results show that ProgSG reduces the RMSE of\ndesign performance predictions by up to $22\\%$, and identifies designs with an\naverage of $1.10\\times$ and $1.26\\times$ (up to $8.17\\times$ and $13.31\\times$)\nperformance improvement in design space exploration (DSE) task compared to HARP\nand AutoDSE, respectively.",

HDC employs high-dimensional\nvectors and efficient operators to encode and manipulate information,\nrepresenting complex objects from atomic concepts. When one attempts to decode\na hypervector that is the product (binding) of multiple hypervectors, the\nfactorization becomes prohibitively costly with classical optimization-based\nmethods and specialized recurrent networks, an inherent consequence of the\nbinding operation. We propose HDQF, an innovative quantum computing approach,\nto address this challenge.

The related estimation error\ninduces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we\nshow, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we\npropose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding\noutputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the\npreviously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost.\nConsequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence\nbut also enhances its overall performance.

In doing so, this dissertation articulates a research vision for a\nnew field of scholarship at the intersection of machine learning, law, and\npolicy. Within this frame, we cover topics that fit under three different\nthemes: (1) quantifying and mitigating sources of arbitrariness in ML, (2)\ntaming randomness in uncertainty estimation and optimization algorithms, in\norder to achieve scalability without sacrificing reliability, and (3) providing\nmethods for evaluating generative-AI systems, with specific focuses on\nquantifying memorization in language models and training latent diffusion\nmodels on open-licensed data. By making contributions in these three themes,\nthis dissertation serves as an empirical proof by example that research on\nreliable measurement for machine learning is intimately and inescapably bound\nup with research in law and policy.

      "abstract": "Methods for knowledge graph (KG) completion need to capture semantic\nregularities and use these regularities to infer plausible knowledge that is\nnot explicitly stated. Most embedding-based methods are opaque in the kinds of\nregularities they can capture, although region-based KG embedding models have\nemerged as a more transparent alternative. By modeling relations as geometric\nregions in high-dimensional vector spaces, such models can explicitly capture\nsemantic regularities in terms of the spatial arrangement of these regions.\nUnfortunately, existing region-based approaches are severely limited in the\nkinds of rules they can capture. We argue that this limitation arises because\nthe considered regions are defined as the Cartesian product of two-dimensional\nregions. As an alternative, in this paper, we propose RESHUFFLE, a simple model\nbased on ordering constraints that can faithfully capture a much larger class\nof rule bases than existing approaches. Moreover, the embeddings in our\nframework can be learned by a monotonic Graph Neural Network (GNN), which\neffectively acts as a differentiable rule base. This approach has the important\nadvantage that embeddings can be easily updated as new knowledge is added to\nthe KG. At the same time, since the resulting representations can be used\nsimilarly to standard KG embeddings, our approach is significantly more\nefficient than existing approaches to differentiable reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Although it is known that transformer language models (LMs) pass features\nfrom early layers to later layers, it is not well understood how this\ninformation is represented and routed by the model. We analyze a mechanism used\nin two LMs to selectively inhibit items in a context in one task, and find that\nit underlies a commonly used abstraction across many context-retrieval\nbehaviors. Specifically, we find that models write into low-rank subspaces of\nthe residual stream to represent features which are then read out by later\nlayers, forming low-rank communication channels (Elhage et al., 2021) between\nlayers. A particular 3D subspace in model activations in GPT-2 can be traversed\nto positionally index items in lists, and we show that this mechanism can\nexplain an otherwise arbitrary-seeming sensitivity of the model to the order of\nitems in the prompt. That is, the model has trouble copying the correct\ninformation from context when many items ``crowd\" this limited space. By\ndecomposing attention heads with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we\nfind that previously described interactions between heads separated by one or\nmore layers can be predicted via analysis of their weight matrices alone. We\nshow that it is possible to manipulate the internal model representations as\nwell as edit model weights based on the mechanism we discover in order to\nsignificantly improve performance on our synthetic Laundry List task, which\nrequires recall from a list, often improving task accuracy by over 20%. Our\nanalysis reveals a surprisingly intricate interpretable structure learned from\nlanguage model pretraining, and helps us understand why sophisticated LMs\nsometimes fail in simple domains, facilitating future analysis of more complex\nbehaviors.",

In SAI,\nobjects exhibit great variations in scales and aspect ratios, and there exist\nrich relationships between objects (even between spatially disjoint objects),\nwhich makes it attractive to holistically conduct SGG in large-size\nvery-high-resolution (VHR) SAI. However, there lack such SGG datasets. Due to\nthe complexity of large-size SAI, mining triplets <subject, relationship,\nobject> heavily relies on long-range contextual reasoning. Consequently, SGG\nmodels designed for small-size natural imagery are not directly applicable to\nlarge-size SAI. This paper constructs a large-scale dataset for SGG in\nlarge-size VHR SAI with image sizes ranging from 512 x 768 to 27,860 x 31,096\npixels, named STAR (Scene graph generaTion in lArge-size satellite imageRy),\nencompassing over 210K objects and over 400K triplets.

      "abstract": "Current multimodal and multitask foundation models like 4M or UnifiedIO show\npromising results, but in practice their out-of-the-box abilities to accept\ndiverse inputs and perform diverse tasks are limited by the (usually rather\nsmall) number of modalities and tasks they are trained on. In this paper, we\nexpand upon the capabilities of them by training a single model on tens of\nhighly diverse modalities and by performing co-training on large-scale\nmultimodal datasets and text corpora. This includes training on several\nsemantic and geometric modalities, feature maps from recent state of the art\nmodels like DINOv2 and ImageBind, pseudo labels of specialist models like SAM\nand 4DHumans, and a range of new modalities that allow for novel ways to\ninteract with the model and steer the generation, for example image metadata or\ncolor palettes. A crucial step in this process is performing discrete\ntokenization on various modalities, whether they are image-like, neural network\nfeature maps, vectors, structured data like instance segmentation or human\nposes, or data that can be represented as text. Through this, we expand on the\nout-of-the-box capabilities of multimodal models and specifically show the\npossibility of training one model to solve at least 3x more tasks/modalities\nthan existing ones and doing so without a loss in performance. This enables\nmore fine-grained and controllable multimodal generation capabilities and\nallows us to study the distillation of models trained on diverse data and\nobjectives into a unified model. We successfully scale the training to a three\nbillion parameter model using tens of modalities and different datasets. The\nresulting models and training code are open sourced at 4m.epfl.ch.",

To overcome the fundamental\nlimitation of missing 3D consistency in 2D diffusion models, our key insight is\nto introduce three synergetic strategies that augment the input of the 2D\ndiffusion model to become 3D-aware and to explicitly enforce 3D consistency\nduring the training process. Specifically, we design surrounding views as\ncontext-rich input for the 2D diffusion model, and generate 3D-consistent,\nstructured noise instead of image-independent noise. Moreover, we introduce\nself-supervised consistency-enforcing training within the per-scene editing\nprocedure. Extensive evaluation shows that our ConsistDreamer achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for instruction-guided scene editing across\nvarious scenes and editing instructions, particularly in complicated\nlarge-scale indoor scenes from ScanNet++, with significantly improved sharpness\nand fine-grained textures.

However, limited by existing\ndatasets, previous works mainly focus on understanding object properties or\ninter-object spatial relationships in a 3D scene. To tackle this problem, this\npaper builds the first largest ever multi-modal 3D scene dataset and benchmark\nwith hierarchical grounded language annotations, MMScan. It is constructed\nbased on a top-down logic, from region to object level, from a single target to\ninter-target relationships, covering holistic aspects of spatial and attribute\nunderstanding. The overall pipeline incorporates powerful VLMs via carefully\ndesigned prompts to initialize the annotations efficiently and further involve\nhumans' correction in the loop to ensure the annotations are natural, correct,\nand comprehensive. Built upon existing 3D scanning data, the resulting\nmulti-modal 3D dataset encompasses 1.4M meta-annotated captions on 109k objects\nand 7.7k regions as well as over 3.04M diverse samples for 3D visual grounding\nand question-answering benchmarks.

Traditional applications of\n2D diffusion models in dynamic scene editing often result in inconsistency,\nprimarily due to their inherent frame-by-frame editing methodology. Addressing\nthe complexities of extending instruction-guided editing to 4D, our key insight\nis to treat a 4D scene as a pseudo-3D scene, decoupled into two sub-problems:\nachieving temporal consistency in video editing and applying these edits to the\npseudo-3D scene. Following this, we first enhance the Instruct-Pix2Pix (IP2P)\nmodel with an anchor-aware attention module for batch processing and consistent\nediting. Additionally, we integrate optical flow-guided appearance propagation\nin a sliding window fashion for more precise frame-to-frame editing and\nincorporate depth-based projection to manage the extensive data of pseudo-3D\nscenes, followed by iterative editing to achieve convergence. We extensively\nevaluate our approach in various scenes and editing instructions, and\ndemonstrate that it achieves spatially and temporally consistent editing\nresults, with significantly enhanced detail and sharpness over the prior art.\nNotably, Instruct 4D-to-4D is general and applicable to both monocular and\nchallenging multi-camera scenes.

While these\nmodels acquire strong capabilities, they may not follow the user's intent to\noutput the desired results in certain aspects, e.g., visual aesthetic,\npreferred style, and responsibility. In this paper, we target the realm of\nvisual aesthetics and aim to align vision models with human aesthetic standards\nin a retrieval system. Advanced retrieval systems usually adopt a cascade of\naesthetic models as re-rankers or filters, which are limited to low-level\nfeatures like saturation and perform poorly when stylistic, cultural or\nknowledge contexts are involved. We find that utilizing the reasoning ability\nof large language models (LLMs) to rephrase the search query and extend the\naesthetic expectations can make up for this shortcoming. Based on the above\nfindings, we propose a preference-based reinforcement learning method that\nfine-tunes the vision models to distill the knowledge from both LLMs reasoning\nand the aesthetic models to better align the vision models with human\naesthetics. Meanwhile, with rare benchmarks designed for evaluating retrieval\nsystems, we leverage large multi-modality model (LMM) to evaluate the aesthetic\nperformance with their strong abilities. As aesthetic assessment is one of the\nmost subjective tasks, to validate the robustness of LMM, we further propose a\nnovel dataset named HPIR to benchmark the alignment with human aesthetics.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the aesthetic\nbehaviors of the vision models, under several metrics. We believe the proposed\nalgorithm can be a general practice for aligning vision models with human\nvalues.",

Traditional methods for addressing fairness have\nfailed in domain generalization due to their lack of consideration for\ndistribution shifts. Although disentanglement has been used to tackle FairDG,\nit is limited by its strong assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Fairness-aware Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models (FADE) as\na novel approach to effectively address the FairDG issue.

Then, we guide the SDM using these pre-trained classifiers to\neffectively eliminate sensitive information from the generated data. Finally,\nthe generated fair data is used to train downstream classifiers, ensuring\nrobust performance under new data distributions. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that FADE not only enhances fairness but also\nimproves accuracy in the presence of distribution shifts.

      "abstract": "While imitation learning requires access to high-quality data, offline\nreinforcement learning (RL) should, in principle, perform similarly or better\nwith substantially lower data quality by using a value function. However,\ncurrent results indicate that offline RL often performs worse than imitation\nlearning, and it is often unclear what holds back the performance of offline\nRL. Motivated by this observation, we aim to understand the bottlenecks in\ncurrent offline RL algorithms. While poor performance of offline RL is\ntypically attributed to an imperfect value function, we ask: is the main\nbottleneck of offline RL indeed in learning the value function, or something\nelse? To answer this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of (1)\nvalue learning, (2) policy extraction, and (3) policy generalization in offline\nRL problems, analyzing how these components affect performance. We make two\nsurprising observations. First, we find that the choice of a policy extraction\nalgorithm significantly affects the performance and scalability of offline RL,\noften more so than the value learning objective. For instance, we show that\ncommon value-weighted behavioral cloning objectives (e.g., AWR) do not fully\nleverage the learned value function, and switching to behavior-constrained\npolicy gradient objectives (e.g., DDPG+BC) often leads to substantial\nimprovements in performance and scalability. Second, we find that a big barrier\nto improving offline RL performance is often imperfect policy generalization on\ntest-time states out of the support of the training data, rather than policy\nlearning on in-distribution states. We then show that the use of suboptimal but\nhigh-coverage data or test-time policy training techniques can address this\ngeneralization issue in practice. Specifically, we propose two simple test-time\npolicy improvement methods and show that these methods lead to better\nperformance.",

This diversity\nchallenges researchers in choosing suitable evaluation methods and comparing\ndifferent attacks and defenses. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis of jailbreak evaluation methodologies, drawing from nearly 90\njailbreak research published between May 2023 and April 2024. Our study\nintroduces a systematic taxonomy of jailbreak evaluators, offering indepth\ninsights into their strengths and weaknesses, along with the current status of\ntheir adaptation. To aid further research, we propose JailbreakEval, a toolkit\nfor evaluating jailbreak attempts. JailbreakEval includes various evaluators\nout-of-the-box, enabling users to obtain results with a single command or\ncustomized evaluation workflows. In summary, we regard JailbreakEval to be a\ncatalyst that simplifies the evaluation process in jailbreak research and\nfosters an inclusive standard for jailbreak evaluation within the community.",

In multi-agent settings, whether each agent decides on\ntheir policy before or after knowing the causal intervention is important as\nthis affects whether they can respond to the intervention by adapting their\npolicy. Consequently, previous work in causal games imposed chronological\nconstraints on permissible interventions. We relax this by outlining a sound\nand complete set of primitive causal interventions so the effect of any\narbitrarily complex interventional query can be studied in multi-agent\nsettings.

In VLoRA, a model consists of layers, each of which recursively\nlearns an increment based on the previous layer. We then apply LoRA\ndecomposition to the increments. VLoRA works on the base model, which is\northogonal to LoRA, meaning they can be used together. We do experiments on\nvarious tasks and models. The results show that 1) with VLoRA, the Transformer\nmodel parameter count can be reduced dramatically and 2) the performance of the\noriginal model is preserved.

      "abstract": "The quality of Virtual Reality (VR) apps is vital, particularly the rendering\nquality of the VR Graphical User Interface (GUI). Different from traditional 2D\napps, VR apps create a 3D digital scene for users, by rendering two distinct 2D\nimages for the user's left and right eyes, respectively. Stereoscopic visual\ninconsistency (denoted as \"SVI\") issues, however, undermine the rendering\nprocess of the user's brain, leading to user discomfort and even adverse health\neffects. Such issues commonly exist but remain underexplored. We conduct an\nempirical analysis on 282 SVI bug reports from 15 VR platforms, summarizing 15\ntypes of manifestations. The empirical analysis reveals that automatically\ndetecting SVI issues is challenging, mainly because: (1) lack of training data;\n(2) the manifestations of SVI issues are diverse, complicated, and often\napplication-specific; (3) most accessible VR apps are closed-source commercial\nsoftware. Existing pattern-based supervised classification approaches may be\ninapplicable or ineffective in detecting the SVI issues. To counter these\nchallenges, we propose an unsupervised black-box testing framework named\nStereoID to identify the stereoscopic visual inconsistencies, based only on the\nrendered GUI states. StereoID generates a synthetic right-eye image based on\nthe actual left-eye image and computes distances between the synthetic\nright-eye image and the actual right-eye image to detect SVI issues. We propose\na depth-aware conditional stereo image translator to power the image generation\nprocess, which captures the expected perspective shifts between left-eye and\nright-eye images. We build a large-scale unlabeled VR stereo screenshot dataset\nwith larger than 171K images from 288 real-world VR apps for experiments. After\nsubstantial experiments, StereoID demonstrates superior performance for\ndetecting SVI issues in both user reports and wild VR apps.",

Instead of conditioning on a sequence of text tokens, we propose to use\na set of per-object representations, Neural Assets, to control the 3D pose of\nindividual objects in a scene. Neural Assets are obtained by pooling visual\nrepresentations of objects from a reference image, such as a frame in a video,\nand are trained to reconstruct the respective objects in a different image,\ne.g., a later frame in the video. Importantly, we encode object visuals from\nthe reference image while conditioning on object poses from the target frame.\nThis enables learning disentangled appearance and pose features. Combining\nvisual and 3D pose representations in a sequence-of-tokens format allows us to\nkeep the text-to-image architecture of existing models, with Neural Assets in\nplace of text tokens. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion\nmodel with this information, our approach enables fine-grained 3D pose and\nplacement control of individual objects in a scene. We further demonstrate that\nNeural Assets can be transferred and recomposed across different scenes.

To understand these\ngaps, we introduce a systematic review of over 400 papers published between\n2019 and January 2024, spanning multiple domains such as Human-Computer\nInteraction (HCI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML). We\ncharacterize, define and scope human-AI alignment. From this, we present a\nconceptual framework of \"Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment\" to organize the\nliterature from a human-centered perspective. This framework encompasses both\n1) conventional studies of aligning AI to humans that ensures AI produces the\nintended outcomes determined by humans, and 2) a proposed concept of aligning\nhumans to AI, which aims to help individuals and society adjust to AI\nadvancements both cognitively and behaviorally. Additionally, we articulate the\nkey findings derived from literature analysis, including literature gaps and\ntrends, human values, and interaction techniques. To pave the way for future\nstudies, we envision three key challenges and give recommendations for future\nresearch.",

We provide a theoretical guarantee of model\nuncertainty and performance bound of SeMOPO.

With the rise of Language Models (LMs), LM-based recommenders\nhave been widely explored due to their extensive world knowledge and powerful\nreasoning abilities. Most of the LM-based recommenders convert historical\ninteractions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target\nresponse and fine-tuning LM with a language modeling loss. However, the current\nobjective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for\npersonalized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of LM-based\nrecommenders. Inspired by the current advancement of Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax\nloss in recommendations, we propose Softmax-DPO (S-DPO) to instill ranking\ninformation into the LM to help LM-based recommenders distinguish preferred\nitems from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives. Specifically,\nwe incorporate multiple negatives in user preference data and devise an\nalternative version of DPO loss tailored for LM-based recommenders, which is\nextended from the traditional full-ranking Plackett-Luce (PL) model to partial\nrankings and connected to softmax sampling strategies. Theoretically, we bridge\nS-DPO with the softmax loss over negative sampling and find that it has an\ninherent benefit of mining hard negatives, which assures its exceptional\ncapabilities in recommendation tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments\nconducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of S-DPO to\neffectively model user preference and further boost recommendation performance\nwhile providing better rewards for preferred items.

      "abstract": "Content generation conditioning on users's readability is an important\napplication for personalization. In an era of large language models (LLMs),\nreadability-controlled text generation based on LLMs has become increasingly\nimportant. This paper introduces a novel methodology called\n\"Readability-Controlled Instruction Learning (ReadCtrl),\" which aims to\ninstruction-tune LLMs to tailor users' readability levels. Unlike the\ntraditional methods, which primarily focused on categorical readability\nadjustments typically classified as high, medium, and low or expert and\nlayperson levels with limited success, ReadCtrl introduces a dynamic framework\nthat enables LLMs to generate content at various (near continuous level)\ncomplexity levels, thereby enhancing their versatility across different\napplications. Our results show that the ReadCtrl-Mistral-7B models\nsignificantly outperformed strong baseline models such as GPT-4 and Claude-3,\nwith a win rate of 52.1%:35.7% against GPT-4 in human evaluations. Furthermore,\nRead-Ctrl has shown significant improvements in automatic evaluations, as\nevidenced by better readability metrics (e.g., FOG, FKGL) and generation\nquality metrics (e.g., BLEU, SARI, SummaC-Factuality, UniEval-Consistency and\nCoherence). These results underscore Read-Ctrl's effectiveness and tenacity in\nproducing high-quality, contextually appropriate outputs that closely align\nwith targeted readability levels, marking a significant advancement in\npersonalized content generation using LLMs.",

Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for\ngeneralizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured\nmulti-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning the commonality and\nspecificity within categories. Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized\nDomain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience\nstructuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously\naligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG.\nSpecifically, feature structuralization (FS) is accomplished through joint\noptimization of five constraints: a decorrelation function applied to\ndisentangled segments, three constraints ensuring common feature consistency\nand specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration term. By\nimposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features\nbased on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions\namong categories. Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently\nvalidates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an\naverage improvement of 6.2% in FGDG performance.

However, they\nare prone to hallucinations, generating claims that contradict established\nfacts, deviating from prompts, and producing inconsistent responses when the\nsame prompt is presented multiple times. Addressing these issues is challenging\ndue to the lack of comprehensive and easily assessable benchmark datasets. Most\nexisting datasets are small and rely on multiple-choice questions, which are\ninadequate for evaluating the generative prowess of LLMs. To measure\nhallucination in LLMs, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark dataset\ncomprising over 75,000 prompts across eight domains. These prompts are designed\nto elicit definitive, concise, and informative answers. The dataset is divided\ninto two segments: one publicly available for testing and assessing LLM\nperformance and a hidden segment for benchmarking various LLMs. In our\nexperiments, we tested six LLMs-GPT-3.5, LLama 2, LLama 3, Gemini, Mixtral, and\nZephyr-revealing that overall factual hallucination ranges from 59% to 82% on\nthe public dataset and 57% to 76% in the hidden benchmark.

Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to\nequip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as\nhistorical training data and future test data can have different distributions.\nIn this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via\ninvariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning\nfor TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined\nby the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional\nassumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate\nenvironment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not\nsuitable for TSF.\n  To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that\nenables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via\nInvariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact\nof unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by\nalternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while\npreserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant\nrepresentations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of\nvarious TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.",

      "abstract": "Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a prominent method that adds a small number of\nlearnable parameters to the frozen pre-trained weights for parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning. Prompted by the question, ``Can we make its representation enough\nwith LoRA weights solely at the final phase of finetuning without the\npre-trained weights?'' In this work, we introduce Progressive Compression\nLoRA~(PC-LoRA), which utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to simultaneously\nperform model compression and fine-tuning. The PC-LoRA method gradually removes\nthe pre-trained weights during the training process, eventually leaving only\nthe low-rank adapters in the end. Thus, these low-rank adapters replace the\nwhole pre-trained weights, achieving the goals of compression and fine-tuning\nat the same time. Empirical analysis across various models demonstrates that\nPC-LoRA achieves parameter and FLOPs compression rates of 94.36%/89.1% for\nvision models, e.g., ViT-B, and 93.42%/84.2% parameters and FLOPs compressions\nfor language models, e.g., BERT.",

We perform\nour evaluation on three large-scale protocols that mimic real-world challenges,\nwhere we train on known and negative open-set samples, and test on known and\nunknown instances. Our results show that EOS helps to improve performance of\nalmost all post-processing algorithms.

There is no systematic\nreview of multimodal tasks in the insurance domain, nor a benchmark\nspecifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This\ngap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance domain. In this\npaper, we systematically review and distill multimodal tasks for four\nrepresentative types of insurance: auto insurance, property insurance, health\ninsurance, and agricultural insurance. We propose INS-MMBench, the first\ncomprehensive LVLMs benchmark tailored for the insurance domain.

Furthermore, we evaluate\nmultiple representative LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o\nand open-source models like BLIP-2. This evaluation not only validates the\neffectiveness of our benchmark but also provides an in-depth performance\nanalysis of current LVLMs on various multimodal tasks in the insurance domain.\nWe hope that INS-MMBench will facilitate the further application of LVLMs in\nthe insurance domain and inspire interdisciplinary development.

Different from extracting relations from text, it is difficult to\nidentify relations among words without their contexts. Especially for long-tail\nrelations, it becomes more difficult due to inadequate semantic features.\nExisting approaches based on language models (LMs) utilize rich knowledge of\nLMs to enhance the semantic features of relations. However, they capture\nuncommon relations while overlooking less frequent but meaningful ones since\nknowledge of LMs seriously relies on trained data where often represents common\nrelations. On the other hand, long-tail relations are often uncommon in\ntraining data. It is interesting but not trivial to use external knowledge to\nenrich LMs due to collecting corpus containing long-tail relationships is\nhardly feasible. In this paper, we propose a sememe knowledge enhanced method\n(SememeLM) to enhance the representation of long-tail relations, in which\nsememes can break the contextual constraints between wors. Firstly, we present\na sememe relation graph and propose a graph encoding method. Moreover, since\nexternal knowledge base possibly consisting of massive irrelevant knowledge,\nthe noise is introduced. We propose a consistency alignment module, which\naligns the introduced knowledge with LMs, reduces the noise and integrates the\nknowledge into the language model.

      "abstract": "LLM development involves pre-training a foundation model on massive data,\nfollowed by fine-tuning on task-specific data to create specialized experts.\nServing these experts can pose significant memory challenges, as loading all\nexperts onto devices is impractical, and frequent switching between experts in\nresponse to user requests can incur substantial I/O costs. Previous approaches\ndecompose the expert weights as the pre-trained weights plus delta weights,\nfollowed by quantizing the delta weights using output channel-wise step sizes\nto reduce the model size. However, these methods overlook the fact that certain\ninput channels of delta weights can cause significant quantization errors at\nextremely low bitwidths. Additionally, existing methods assume that the\nappropriate model for a user request is known in advance, which is not the case\nin practice. To this end, we introduce ME-Switch, a memory-efficient expert\nswitching framework tailored for serving multiple LLMs. To condense the number\nof bits required for describing the delta weights, we propose a salient-aware\ndelta compression method that identifies salient input channels based on\nreconstruction error and applies mixed-precision quantization, reducing\nnon-salient channels to low bits while keeping salient ones intact, cutting\nstorage demand without compromising performance. Moreover, we develop a\nmodel-level routing method that efficiently directs user queries to the most\nsuitable expert by performing domain classification. Extensive experiments show\nthe promising memory efficiency and routing performance of ME-Switch. For\nexample, when serving three models from the Mistral-7B family, ME-Switch\nreduces the model size by $1.74\\times$ and maintains nearly lossless\nperformance on instruction, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks.\nNotably, our method can efficiently serve 16 Mistral-7B models on a single\nNVIDIA A100 GPU.",

      "abstract": "The utilization of the experience replay mechanism enables agents to\neffectively leverage their experiences on several occasions. In previous\nstudies, the sampling probability of the transitions was modified based on\ntheir relative significance. The process of reassigning sample probabilities\nfor every transition in the replay buffer after each iteration is considered\nextremely inefficient. Hence, in order to enhance computing efficiency,\nexperience replay prioritization algorithms reassess the importance of a\ntransition as it is sampled. However, the relative importance of the\ntransitions undergoes dynamic adjustments when the agent's policy and value\nfunction are iteratively updated. Furthermore, experience replay is a mechanism\nthat retains the transitions generated by the agent's past policies, which\ncould potentially diverge significantly from the agent's most recent policy. An\nincreased deviation from the agent's most recent policy results in a greater\nfrequency of off-policy updates, which has a negative impact on the agent's\nperformance. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm, Corrected Uniform\nExperience Replay (CUER), which stochastically samples the stored experience\nwhile considering the fairness among all other experiences without ignoring the\ndynamic nature of the transition importance by making sampled state\ndistribution more on-policy. CUER provides promising improvements for\noff-policy continuous control algorithms in terms of sample efficiency, final\nperformance, and stability of the policy during the training.",

      "abstract": "The latest breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), eg., ChatDev, have\ncatalyzed profound transformations, particularly through multi-agent\ncollaboration for software development. LLM agents can collaborate in teams\nlike humans, and follow the waterfall model to sequentially work on\nrequirements analysis, development, review, testing, and other phases to\nperform autonomous software generation. However, for an agent team, each phase\nin a single development process yields only one possible outcome. This results\nin the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity\nto explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space.\nConsequently, this may lead to obtaining suboptimal results. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC), a scalable multi-team\nframework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions\nand communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment\nfor superior content generation. Experimental results in software development\nreveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines,\nunderscoring the efficacy of our framework. The significant improvements in\nstory generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of our\nframework across various domains. We anticipate that our work will guide LLM\nagents towards a cross-team paradigm and contribute to their significant growth\nin but not limited to software development.

Depth improves separation power up to a\nthreshold, after which further increases have no effect. Adding invariant\nfeatures to hidden representations does not impact separation power.

To explore the financial asset dependencies dynamics, we\npropose a novel approach that models the dependencies of assets as an Asset\nDependency Matrix (ADM) and treats the ADM sequences as image sequences. This\nallows us to leverage deep learning-based video prediction methods to capture\nthe spatiotemporal dependencies among assets.

Efficient training strategies specifically tailored for MVF models\nto attain comprehensive representations need simultaneous consideration.\nCrucially, real-world data frequently arrives with incomplete views, an aspect\nrarely noticed by researchers. Thus, the View-Centric Transformer (VCT) and\nMultitask Masked Autoencoder (M2AE) are specifically designed to emphasize the\ncentrality of each view and harness unlabeled data to achieve superior fused\nrepresentations. Additionally, we systematically define the missing-view\nproblem for the first time and introduce prompt techniques to aid pretrained\nMVF models in flexibly adapting to various missing-view scenarios. Rigorous\nexperiments involving atrial fibrillation detection, blood pressure estimation,\nand sleep staging-typical health monitoring tasks-demonstrate the remarkable\nadvantage of our method in MVF compared to prevailing methodologies. Notably,\nthe prompt technique requires finetuning less than 3% of the entire model's\ndata, substantially fortifying the model's resilience to view missing while\ncircumventing the need for complete retraining.

However, in addition to\nlow efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a\nlimited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room\ngeometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener\nand sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual\nGaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model.

To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point\ndensification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points,\nwith the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed\nfor texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion).

These parameters include attained accuracy levels,\napplication domains, algorithmic advancements, computational speed, and\nconsiderations of energy efficiency and power consumption. We also identify the\nneural network-based experiments implemented using these hardware devices and\ndiscuss comparative performance achieved by the different analog deep learning\nmethods along with an analysis of their current limitations. Overall, we find\nthat Analog Deep Learning has great potential for future consumer-level\napplications, but there is still a long road ahead in terms of scalability.\nMost of the current implementations are more proof of concept and are not yet\npractically deployable for large-scale models.",

      "abstract": "In time division duplexing (TDD) millimeter wave (mmWave) massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink channel state\ninformation (CSI) can be obtained from uplink channel estimation thanks to\nchannel reciprocity. However, under high-mobility scenarios, frequent uplink\nchannel estimation is needed due to channel aging. Additionally, large amounts\nof antennas and subcarriers result in high-dimensional CSI matrices,\naggravating pilot training overhead. To address this, we propose a three-domain\n(3D) channel extrapolation framework across spatial, frequency, and temporal\ndomains. First, considering the effectiveness of traditional knowledge-driven\nchannel estimation methods and the marginal effects of pilots in the spatial\nand frequency domains, a knowledge-and-data driven spatial-frequency channel\nextrapolation network (KDD-SFCEN) is proposed for uplink channel estimation via\njoint spatial-frequency channel extrapolation to reduce spatial-frequency\ndomain pilot overhead. Then, leveraging channel reciprocity and temporal\ndependencies, we propose a temporal uplink-downlink channel extrapolation\nnetwork (TUDCEN) powered by generative artificial intelligence for slot-level\nchannel extrapolation, aiming to reduce the tremendous temporal domain pilot\noverhead caused by high mobility. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed framework in significantly reducing the pilot training overhead\nby 16 times and improving the system's spectral efficiency under high-mobility\nscenarios compared with state-of-the-art channel estimation/extrapolation\nmethods.",

Traditional graph machine learning models, such as Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs), excel in encoding the graph structural information, but have\nlimited capability in handling rich text on graph nodes. Large Language Models\n(LLMs), noted for their superior text understanding abilities, offer a solution\nfor processing the text in graphs but face integration challenges due to their\nlimitation for encoding graph structures and their computational complexities\nwhen dealing with extensive text in large neighborhoods of interconnected\nnodes. This paper introduces ``Hierarchical Compression'' (HiCom), a novel\nmethod to align the capabilities of LLMs with the structure of text-rich\ngraphs. HiCom processes text in a node's neighborhood in a structured manner by\norganizing the extensive textual information into a more manageable hierarchy\nand compressing node text step by step. Therefore, HiCom not only preserves the\ncontextual richness of the text but also addresses the computational challenges\nof LLMs, which presents an advancement in integrating the text processing power\nof LLMs with the structural complexities of text-rich graphs. Empirical results\nshow that HiCom can outperform both GNNs and LLM backbones for node\nclassification on e-commerce and citation graphs. HiCom is especially effective\nfor nodes from a dense region in a graph, where it achieves a 3.48% average\nperformance improvement on five datasets while being more efficient than LLM\nbackbones.",

However, this technological leap comes\nwith a substantial increase in energy consumption, presenting a significant\nchallenge. To improve the energy efficiency of 5G networks, it is imperative to\ndevelop sophisticated models that accurately reflect the influence of base\nstation (BS) attributes and operational conditions on energy usage.Importantly,\naddressing the complexity and interdependencies of these diverse features is\nparticularly challenging, both in terms of data processing and model\narchitecture design.\n  This paper proposes a novel 5G base stations energy consumption modelling\nmethod by learning from a real-world dataset used in the ITU 5G Base Station\nEnergy Consumption Modelling Challenge in which our model ranked second. Unlike\nexisting methods that omit the Base Station Identifier (BSID) information and\nthus fail to capture the unique energy fingerprint in different base stations,\nwe incorporate the BSID into the input features and encoding it with an\nembedding layer for precise representation. Additionally, we introduce a novel\nmasked training method alongside an attention mechanism to further boost the\nmodel's generalization capabilities and accuracy.

      "abstract": "To facilitate the evolution of edge intelligence in ever-changing\nenvironments, we study on-device incremental learning constrained in limited\ncomputation resource in this paper. Current on-device training methods just\nfocus on efficient training without considering the catastrophic forgetting,\npreventing the model getting stronger when continually exploring the world. To\nsolve this problem, a direct solution is to involve the existing incremental\nlearning mechanisms into the on-device training framework. Unfortunately, such\na manner cannot work well as those mechanisms usually introduce large\nadditional computational cost to the network optimization process, which would\ninevitably exceed the memory capacity of the edge devices. To address this\nissue, this paper makes an early effort to propose a simple but effective\nedge-friendly incremental learning framework. Based on an empirical study on\nthe knowledge intensity of the kernel elements of the neural network, we find\nthat the center kernel is the key for maximizing the knowledge intensity for\nlearning new data, while freezing the other kernel elements would get a good\nbalance on the model's capacity for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Upon\nthis finding, we further design a center-sensitive kernel optimization\nframework to largely alleviate the cost of the gradient computation and\nback-propagation. Besides, a dynamic channel element selection strategy is also\nproposed to facilitate a sparse orthogonal gradient projection for further\nreducing the optimization complexity, upon the knowledge explored from the new\ntask data. Extensive experiments validate our method is efficient and\neffective, e.g., our method achieves average accuracy boost of 38.08% with even\nless memory and approximate computation compared to existing on-device training\nmethods, indicating its significant potential for on-device incremental\nlearning.",

To address these concerns, we conduct an\nHRI-based evaluation of discrimination and safety criteria on several\nhighly-rated LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs currently lack robustness\nwhen encountering people across a diverse range of protected identity\ncharacteristics (e.g., race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion,\nand their intersections), producing biased outputs consistent with directly\ndiscriminatory outcomes -- e.g. `gypsy' and `mute' people are labeled\nuntrustworthy, but not `european' or `able-bodied' people. Furthermore, we test\nmodels in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary)\ninputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept\ndangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions -- such as incident-causing\nmisstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation. Our results\nunderscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk\nassessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on\nrobots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so.

      "abstract": "Demonstrations are an effective alternative to task specification for\nlearning agents in settings where designing a reward function is difficult.\nHowever, demonstrating expert behavior in the action space of the agent becomes\nunwieldy when robots have complex, unintuitive morphologies. We consider the\npractical setting where an agent has a dataset of prior interactions with the\nenvironment and is provided with observation-only expert demonstrations.\nTypical learning from observations approaches have required either learning an\ninverse dynamics model or a discriminator as intermediate steps of training.\nErrors in these intermediate one-step models compound during downstream policy\nlearning or deployment. We overcome these limitations by directly learning a\nmulti-step utility function that quantifies how each action impacts the agent's\ndivergence from the expert's visitation distribution. Using the principle of\nduality, we derive DILO (Dual Imitation Learning from Observations), an\nalgorithm that can leverage arbitrary suboptimal data to learn imitating\npolicies without requiring expert actions. DILO reduces the learning from\nobservations problem to that of simply learning an actor and a critic, bearing\nsimilar complexity to vanilla offline RL. This allows DILO to gracefully scale\nto high dimensional observations, and demonstrate improved performance across\nthe board.

Several studies have leveraged the proximity of\nedge-side to real-time data, fine-tuning them to create edge-specific models.\nDespite their significant progress, these methods require substantial on-edge\ncomputational resources and frequent network transfers to keep the model up to\ndate. The former may disrupt other processes on the edge to acquire\ncomputational resources, while the latter consumes network bandwidth, leading\nto a decrease in user satisfaction. In response to these challenges, we propose\na customizeD slImming framework for incompatiblE neTworks(DIET). DIET deploys\nthe same generic backbone (potentially incompatible for a specific edge) to all\ndevices. To minimize frequent bandwidth usage and storage consumption in\npersonalization, DIET tailors specific subnets for each edge based on its past\ninteractions, learning to generate slimming subnets(diets) within incompatible\nnetworks for efficient transfer. It also takes the inter-layer relationships\ninto account, empirically reducing inference time while obtaining more suitable\ndiets. We further explore the repeated modules within networks and propose a\nmore storage-efficient framework, DIETING, which utilizes a single layer of\nparameters to represent the entire network, achieving comparably excellent\nperformance.

We meticulously\nsupplemented the original dataset with missing annotations at various levels of\ngranularity and added detailed annotations for multi-item table regions within\nthe forms. Additionally, we introduce global hierarchical structure\ndependencies for entity relation prediction tasks, surpassing traditional local\nkey-value associations.

      "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding\nperformance across various multimodal tasks. However, they suffer from a\nproblem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on\ntextual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of\nlanguage prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or\nhallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution.\nDespite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language\npriors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on\ncounterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure\nlanguage priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other\nconfounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called\nVLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the\nlanguage priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on\ncounterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of\ntests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual\nperception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we\nensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language\npriors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment.\nThe evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost\nall models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a\nstrong challenge in the field.",

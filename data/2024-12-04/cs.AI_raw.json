While we can compress activations into\nfeatures, compressing nonlinear feature-maps -- like MLP layers -- is an open\nproblem. In this work, we present the first case study in rigorously\ncompressing nonlinear feature-maps, which are the leading asymptotic bottleneck\nto compressing small transformer models. We work in the classic setting of the\nmodular addition models, and target a non-vacuous bound on the behaviour of the\nReLU MLP in time linear in the parameter-count of the circuit. To study the\nReLU MLP analytically, we use the infinite-width lens, which turns\npost-activation matrix multiplications into approximate integrals. We discover\na novel interpretation of} the MLP layer in one-layer transformers implementing\nthe ``pizza'' algorithm: the MLP can be understood as evaluating a quadrature\nscheme, where each neuron computes the area of a rectangle under the curve of a\ntrigonometric integral identity.

To account for\nsuch uncertainties and factors involved in haze degradation, we introduce a\nvariational Bayesian framework for single image dehazing.

In\nour framework, a dehazing network can estimate a clean image independently of a\ntransmission map estimation during inference, introducing no overhead.\nFurthermore, our model-agnostic framework can be seamlessly incorporated with\nother existing dehazing networks, greatly enhancing the performance\nconsistently across datasets and models.",

    "abstract": "Advances in tracking technologies have spurred the rapid growth of\nlarge-scale trajectory data. Building a compact collection of pathlets,\nreferred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting\nmobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down\napproach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset,\nleading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that\nincrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory\nrequirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach\nbegins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing\nutility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and\nrepresentability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework,\nPathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility\nfunction, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments\non both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed\ndictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the\ndictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory\ndata. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the\noriginal model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved\nreward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These\nenhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the\nenvironment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++\nachieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of\nPathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.",

Soft errors are an increasing concern in\nmodern digital processors since smaller transistor geometries and lower\nvoltages give electronic devices a higher sensitivity to background radiation.\nThe resilience of deep neural network (DNN) models to perturbations in their\nparameters is determined, to a large extent, by the structure of the model\nitself, and also by the selected numerical representation and used arithmetic\nprecision. When compression techniques such as model pruning and model\nquantization are applied to reduce memory footprint and computational\ncomplexity for deployment, both model structure and numerical representation\nare modified and thus, soft error robustness also changes.

BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts.\nAcross all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N),\nempirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN\nJailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more\neffective attacks - combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up\nto a 35% increase in ASR.

Finetuning MLMs on relevant data\ndoesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools\nis too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient.

Within this\ndiscussion, the influence of advanced technologies in achieving carbon\nneutrality has been discussed. While several studies investigated how AI and\nDigital innovations could be used to reduce the environmental footprint, the\nactual influence of AI in reducing CO2 emissions (a proxy measuring carbon\nfootprint) has yet to be investigated. This paper studies the role of advanced\ntechnologies in general, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ICT use in\nparticular, in advancing carbon neutrality in the United States, between 2021.\nSecondly, this paper examines how Stock Market Growth, ICT use, Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP), and Population affect CO2 emissions using the STIRPAT model.\nAfter examining stationarity among the variables using a variety of unit root\ntests, this study concluded that there are no unit root problems across all the\nvariables, with a mixed order of integration. The ARDL bounds test for\ncointegration revealed that variables in this study have a long-run\nrelationship. Moreover, the estimates revealed from the ARDL model in the\nshort- and long-run indicated that economic growth, stock market\ncapitalization, and population significantly contributed to the carbon\nemissions in both the short-run and long-run. Conversely, AI and ICT use\nsignificantly reduced carbon emissions over both periods. Furthermore, findings\nwere confirmed to be robust using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR estimations.\nFurthermore, diagnostic tests indicated the absence of serial correlation,\nheteroscedasticity, and specification errors and, thus, the model was robust.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has\nbrought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning\nattacks on ML malware classifiers. For instance, adversaries could inject\nmalicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training\ndata and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current\ncountermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging\ndisagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on\ntraining data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios\nwhere Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove\nbackdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we\nintroduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates\nvarious types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor\nembedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on\nthe activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the\ntrigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation\ndistribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By\nregulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a\nbackdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates\nsubstantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by\nexperiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack\nconfigurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the\ntraining data -- only 1\\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack\nsuccess rate from 100\\% to almost 0\\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline\nmethods.

One limitation\nof these EAs is the use of unit-level search heuristics, such as branch\ndistances, which focus on fine-grained code coverage and may not effectively\ncapture the complex, interconnected behaviors characteristic of system-level\ntesting. To address this limitation, we propose a new search heuristic (MISH)\nthat uses real-time automaton learning to guide the test case generation\nprocess. We capture the sequential call patterns exhibited by a test case by\nlearning an automaton from the stream of log events outputted by different\nmicroservices within the same system. Therefore, MISH learns a representation\nof the systemwide behavior, allowing us to define the fitness of a test case\nbased on the path it traverses within the inferred automaton. We empirically\nevaluate MISH's effectiveness on six real-world benchmark microservice\napplications and compare it against a state-of-the-art technique, MOSA, for\ntesting REST APIs.

    "abstract": "Language-based agentic systems have shown great promise in recent years,\ntransitioning from solving small-scale research problems to being deployed in\nchallenging real-world tasks. However, optimizing these systems often requires\nsubstantial manual labor. Recent studies have demonstrated that these systems\ncan be represented as computational graphs, enabling automatic optimization.\nDespite these advancements, most current efforts in Graph-based Agentic System\nOptimization (GASO) fail to properly assign feedback to the system's components\ngiven feedback on the system's output. To address this challenge, we formalize\nthe concept of semantic backpropagation with semantic gradients -- a\ngeneralization that aligns several key optimization techniques, including\nreverse-mode automatic differentiation and the more recent TextGrad by\nexploiting the relationship among nodes with a common successor. This serves as\na method for computing directional information about how changes to each\ncomponent of an agentic system might improve the system's output. To use these\ngradients, we propose a method called semantic gradient descent which enables\nus to solve GASO effectively. Our results on both BIG-Bench Hard and GSM8K show\nthat our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for solving\nGASO problems. A detailed ablation study on the LIAR dataset demonstrates the\nparsimonious nature of our method.

It is\ntraditionally treated using open esophagectomy, but in recent years,\nrobot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has emerged as a\npromising alternative. However, robot-assisted surgery can be challenging for\nnovice surgeons, as they often suffer from a loss of spatial orientation.\nComputer-aided anatomy recognition holds promise for improving surgical\nnavigation, but research in this area remains limited. In this study, we\ndeveloped a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation in RAMIE, featuring\nthe largest collection of vital anatomical structures and surgical instruments\nto date. Handling this diverse set of classes presents challenges, including\nclass imbalance and the recognition of complex structures such as nerves. This\nstudy aims to understand the challenges and limitations of current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on this novel dataset and problem. Therefore, we\nbenchmarked eight real-time deep learning models using two pretraining\ndatasets. We assessed both traditional and attention-based networks,\nhypothesizing that attention-based networks better capture global patterns and\naddress challenges such as occlusion caused by blood or other tissues. The\nbenchmark includes our RAMIE dataset and the publicly available CholecSeg8k\ndataset, enabling a thorough assessment of surgical segmentation tasks. Our\nfindings indicate that pretraining on ADE20k, a dataset for semantic\nsegmentation, is more effective than pretraining on ImageNet. Furthermore,\nattention-based models outperform traditional convolutional neural networks,\nwith SegNeXt and Mask2Former achieving higher Dice scores, and Mask2Former\nadditionally excelling in average symmetric surface distance.",

    "abstract": "A key stumbling block in effective supply chain risk management for companies\nand policymakers is a lack of visibility on interdependent supply network\nrelationships. Relationship prediction, also called link prediction is an\nemergent area of supply chain surveillance research that aims to increase the\nvisibility of supply chains using data-driven techniques. Existing methods have\nbeen successful for predicting relationships but struggle to extract the\ncontext in which these relationships are embedded - such as the products being\nsupplied or locations they are supplied from. Lack of context prevents\npractitioners from distinguishing transactional relations from established\nsupply chain relations, hindering accurate estimations of risk. In this work,\nwe develop a new Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) enhanced machine\nlearning framework that leverages pre-trained language models as embedding\nmodels combined with machine learning models to predict supply chain\nrelationships within knowledge graphs. By integrating Generative AI techniques,\nour approach captures the nuanced semantic relationships between entities,\nthereby improving supply chain visibility and facilitating more precise risk\nmanagement. Using data from a real case study, we show that GenAI-enhanced link\nprediction surpasses all benchmarks, and demonstrate how GenAI models can be\nexplored and effectively used in supply chain risk management.",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in\nreplicating human-like abilities, there are concerns about a reduction in the\nlinguistic diversity of their outputs. This results in the homogenization of\nviewpoints and perspectives, as well as the underrepresentation of specific\ndemographic groups. Although several fine-tuning and prompting techniques have\nbeen suggested to tackle the issue, they are often tailored to specific tasks\nor come with a substantial increase in computational cost and latency. This\nmakes them challenging to apply to applications that demand very low latency,\nsuch as chatbots and virtual assistants. We propose Possibility Exploration\nFine-Tuning (PEFT), a task-agnostic framework that enhances the text diversity\nof LLMs without increasing latency or computational cost. Given the same\nprompt, models fine-tuned with PEFT can simultaneously generate multiple\ndiverse responses, each corresponding with a controllable possibility number.\nExperiments on dialogue and story generation tasks demonstrate that PEFT\nsignificantly enhances the diversity of LLM outputs, as evidenced by lower\nsimilarity between candidate responses. Since PEFT emphasizes semantic\ndiversity over lexical diversity, it can also notably reduce demographic bias\nin dialogue systems.

Despite this potential, their capacity to accurately simulate\nhuman route choice behavior in transportation contexts remains doubtful. To\nsatisfy this curiosity, this paper investigates the potential of LLMs for route\nchoice modeling by introducing an LLM-empowered agent, \"LLMTraveler.\" This\nagent integrates an LLM as its core, equipped with a memory system that learns\nfrom past experiences and makes decisions by balancing retrieved data and\npersonality traits. The study systematically evaluates the LLMTraveler's\nability to replicate human-like decision-making through two stages of\nday-to-day (DTD) congestion games: (1) analyzing its route-switching behavior\nin single origin-destination (OD) pair scenarios, where it demonstrates\npatterns that align with laboratory data but cannot be fully explained by\ntraditional models, and (2) testing its capacity to model adaptive learning\nbehaviors in multi-OD scenarios on the Ortuzar and Willumsen (OW) network,\nproducing results comparable to Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) models. These experiments demonstrate that the framework can\npartially replicate human-like decision-making in route choice while providing\nnatural language explanations for its decisions. This capability offers\nvaluable insights for transportation policymaking, such as simulating traveler\nresponses to new policies or changes in the network.",

    "abstract": "It is beyond dispute that the potential benefits of artificial intelligence\n(AI) in military intelligence are considerable. Nevertheless, it remains\nuncertain precisely how AI can enhance the analysis of military data. The aim\nof this study is to address this issue. To this end, the AI demonstrator\ndeepCOM was developed in collaboration with the start-up Aleph Alpha.\n  The AI functions include text search, automatic text summarization and Named\nEntity Recognition (NER). These are evaluated for their added value in military\nanalysis. It is demonstrated that under time pressure, the utilization of AI\nfunctions results in assessments clearly superior to that of the control group.\nNevertheless, despite the demonstrably superior analysis outcome in the\nexperimental group, no increase in confidence in the accuracy of their own\nanalyses was observed. Finally, the paper identifies the limitations of\nemploying AI in military intelligence, particularly in the context of analyzing\nambiguous and contradictory information.",

We propose a path-guided\nparticle-based sampling~(PGPS) method based on a novel Log-weighted Shrinkage\n(LwS) density path linking an initial distribution to the target distribution.\nWe propose to utilize a Neural network to learn a vector field motivated by the\nFokker-Planck equation of the designed density path. Particles, initiated from\nthe initial distribution, evolve according to the ordinary differential\nequation defined by the vector field. The distribution of these particles is\nguided along a density path from the initial distribution to the target\ndistribution. The proposed LwS density path allows for an efficient search of\nmodes of the target distribution while canonical methods fail. We theoretically\nanalyze the Wasserstein distance of the distribution of the PGPS-generated\nsamples and the target distribution due to approximation and discretization\nerrors.

However, our work demonstrates a fundamental\nsecurity vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can\nleverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures\n(UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks.

We also show that this technique can be used for\nwatermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target\nwatermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an\narbitrary prompt.

To address these challenges, we explore\nand adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph\nNeural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation\nframework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each\nhandling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other\ncloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates\nwith other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing\nreliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative\nevaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional\nFL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the\nMETR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed\npredictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are\ncomparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering\nadvantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we\nhighlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed\nST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different\ngeographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant\ncommunication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large\nreceptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased\ncomputation of partial embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) involves the concurrent training of multiple tasks,\noffering notable advantages for dense prediction tasks in computer vision. MTL\nnot only reduces training and inference time as opposed to having multiple\nsingle-task models, but also enhances task accuracy through the interaction of\nmultiple tasks. However, existing methods face limitations. They often rely on\nsuboptimal cross-task interactions, resulting in task-specific predictions with\npoor geometric and predictive coherence. In addition, many approaches use\ninadequate loss weighting strategies, which do not address the inherent\nvariability in task evolution during training. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose an advanced MTL model specifically designed for dense vision tasks. Our\nmodel leverages state-of-the-art vision transformers with task-specific\ndecoders. To enhance cross-task coherence, we introduce a trace-back method\nthat improves both cross-task geometric and predictive features. Furthermore,\nwe present a novel dynamic task balancing approach that projects task losses\nonto a common scale and prioritizes more challenging tasks during training.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, establishing\nnew state-of-the-art performance across two benchmark datasets.

In\nthis paper, we are the first to quantify and evaluate the uncertainty of T2I\nmodels with respect to the prompt. Alongside adapting existing approaches\ndesigned to measure uncertainty in the image space, we also introduce\nPrompt-based UNCertainty Estimation for T2I models (PUNC), a novel method\nleveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to better address uncertainties\narising from the semantics of the prompt and generated images. PUNC utilizes a\nLVLM to caption a generated image, and then compares the caption with the\noriginal prompt in the more semantically meaningful text space. PUNC also\nenables the disentanglement of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties via\nprecision and recall, which image-space approaches are unable to do. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PUNC outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty\nestimation techniques across various settings. Uncertainty quantification in\ntext-to-image generation models can be used on various applications including\nbias detection, copyright protection, and OOD detection.

ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision\nMLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning\nwith time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an\nattribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed\nattribute descriptions.

    "abstract": "Strategy learning in game environments with multi-agent is a challenging\nproblem. Since each agent's reward is determined by the joint strategy, a\ngreedy learning strategy that aims to maximize its own reward may fall into a\nlocal optimum. Recent studies have proposed the opponent modeling and shaping\nmethods for game environments. These methods enhance the efficiency of strategy\nlearning by modeling the strategies and updating processes of other agents.\nHowever, these methods often rely on simple predictions of opponent strategy\nchanges. Due to the lack of modeling behavioral preferences such as cooperation\nand competition, they are usually applicable only to predefined scenarios and\nlack generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel\nPreference-based Opponent Shaping (PBOS) method to enhance the strategy\nlearning process by shaping agents' preferences towards cooperation. We\nintroduce the preference parameter, which is incorporated into the agent's loss\nfunction, thus allowing the agent to directly consider the opponent's loss\nfunction when updating the strategy. We update the preference parameters\nconcurrently with strategy learning to ensure that agents can adapt to any\ncooperative or competitive game environment. Through a series of experiments,\nwe verify the performance of PBOS algorithm in a variety of differentiable\ngames. The experimental results show that the PBOS algorithm can guide the\nagent to learn the appropriate preference parameters, so as to achieve better\nreward distribution in multiple game environments.",

We observe that understanding and\ngeneration require fundamentally different granularities of visual information.\nThis leads to a critical trade-off, particularly compromising performance in\nmultimodal understanding tasks. TokenFlow addresses this challenge through an\ninnovative dual-codebook architecture that decouples semantic and pixel-level\nfeature learning while maintaining their alignment via a shared mapping\nmechanism. This design enables direct access to both high-level semantic\nrepresentations crucial for understanding tasks and fine-grained visual\nfeatures essential for generation through shared indices. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate TokenFlow's superiority across multiple dimensions.\nLeveraging TokenFlow, we demonstrate for the first time that discrete visual\ninput can surpass LLaVA-1.5 13B in understanding performance, achieving a 7.2\\%\naverage improvement. For image reconstruction, we achieve a strong FID score of\n0.63 at 384*384 resolution.

In this paper, a Unified\nTime Series Diffusion (UTSD) model is established for the first time to model\nthe multi-domain probability distribution, utilizing the powerful probability\ndistribution modeling ability of Diffusion. Unlike the autoregressive models\nthat capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the\nhistorical sequence, we use a diffusion denoising process to model the mixture\ndistribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for\nthe target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed UTSD\ncontains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the\nmulti-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are\nutilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate\nthe prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the\nmulti-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is\nutilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) The diffusion and\ndenoising process on the actual sequence space, combined with the improved\nclassifier free guidance as the conditional generation strategy, greatly\nimproves the stability and accuracy of the downstream task. We conduct\nextensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, and the pre-trained UTSD\noutperforms existing foundation models on all data domains, exhibiting superior\nzero-shot generalization ability.

Then, we train the adversary to\nlearn the optimal policy for attacking at critical moments without domain\nknowledge. Furthermore, we introduce attack-related information and a\ntrajectory clipping method to enhance the learning capability of the adversary.\nFinally, we validate our method in an unprotected left-turn scenario across\ndifferent traffic densities.

Given this\nvariety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are\nscarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what\nbottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of\nsynthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity,\nand complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in\nopen-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream\nmodels. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model\ngeneralization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize\nthe existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the\ndownstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various\ncomponents in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This\nexamination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation\nalgorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on\ndata QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance\nof balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and\nself-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data,\noften there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity\nwhich impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are\ncurrently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting\noutput diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that\nbalancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future\nself-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in\nthis direction.",

    "abstract": "Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is a rapidly growing field that focuses\non understanding the interaction dynamics between molecules, which is crucial\nfor applications ranging from catalyst engineering to drug discovery. Despite\nrecent progress, earlier MRL approaches are limited to using only the 2D\ntopological structure of molecules, as obtaining the 3D interaction geometry\nremains prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces a novel 3D geometric\npre-training strategy for MRL (3DMRL) that incorporates a 3D virtual\ninteraction environment, overcoming the limitations of costly traditional\nquantum mechanical calculation methods. With the constructed 3D virtual\ninteraction environment, 3DMRL trains 2D MRL model to learn the overall 3D\ngeometric information of molecular interaction through contrastive learning.\nMoreover, fine-grained interaction between molecules is learned through force\nprediction loss, which is crucial in understanding the wide range of molecular\ninteraction processes. Extensive experiments on various tasks using real-world\ndatasets, including out-of-distribution and extrapolation scenarios,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of 3DMRL, showing up to a 24.93\\% improvement in\nperformance across 40 tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLM) have significantly\nenhanced their ability to comprehend visual inputs alongside natural language.\nHowever, a major challenge in their real-world application is hallucination,\nwhere LVLMs generate non-existent visual elements, eroding user trust. The\nunderlying mechanism driving this multimodal hallucination is poorly\nunderstood. Minimal research has illuminated whether contexts such as sky,\ntree, or grass field involve the LVLM in hallucinating a frisbee. We\nhypothesize that hidden factors, such as objects, contexts, and semantic\nforeground-background structures, induce hallucination. This study proposes a\nnovel causal approach: a hallucination probing system to identify these hidden\nfactors. By analyzing the causality between images, text prompts, and network\nsaliency, we systematically explore interventions to block these factors. Our\nexperimental findings show that a straightforward technique based on our\nanalysis can significantly reduce hallucinations. Additionally, our analyses\nindicate the potential to edit network internals to minimize hallucinated\noutputs.",

    "abstract": "Existing works typically treat spatial-temporal prediction as the task of\nlearning a function $F$ to transform historical observations to future\nobservations. We further decompose this cross-time transformation into three\nprocesses: (1) Encoding ($E$): learning the intrinsic representation of\nobservations, (2) Cross-Time Mapping ($M$): transforming past representations\ninto future representations, and (3) Decoding ($D$): reconstructing future\nobservations from the future representations. From this perspective,\nspatial-temporal prediction can be viewed as learning $F = E \\cdot M \\cdot D$,\nwhich includes learning the space transformations $\\left\\{{E},{D}\\right\\}$\nbetween the observation space and the hidden representation space, as well as\nthe spatial-temporal mapping $M$ from future states to past states within the\nrepresentation space. This leads to two key questions: \\textbf{Q1: What kind of\nrepresentation space allows for mapping the past to the future? Q2: How to\nachieve map the past to the future within the representation space?} To address\nQ1, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Backdoor Adjustment strategy, which learns a\nSpatial-Temporal De-Confounded (STDC) representation space and estimates the\nde-confounding causal effect of historical data on future data. This causal\nrelationship we captured serves as the foundation for subsequent\nspatial-temporal mapping. To address Q2, we design a Spatial-Temporal Embedding\n(STE) that fuses the information of temporal and spatial confounders, capturing\nthe intrinsic spatial-temporal characteristics of the representations.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Cross-Time Attention mechanism, which queries the\nattention between the future and the past to guide spatial-temporal mapping.",

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\ntext-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion\nmodels cannot simultaneously generate an image and a panoptic segmentation of\nobjects and stuff from the prompt. Incorporating an inherent understanding of\nshapes and scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion\nmodels. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM),\nthe first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps\nconcurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing\nsegmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the\ngeneration process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text\nprompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified\ndiffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone.\nWe propose a Multi-Scale Patching mechanism to generate high-resolution\nsegmentation maps. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can\nfunction as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose\na novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM\nachieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene\ncontrol.",

    "abstract": "Transformers are now ubiquitous for sequence modeling tasks, but their\nextension to multi-dimensional data remains a challenge due to the quadratic\ncost of the attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose Higher-Order\nTransformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data\nwith more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the\ncomputational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we\nintroduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the\nattention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in\nthe total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT\nleverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This\nstrategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention\ncomputation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional\ntasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive\nperformance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing\nits potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are designed to predict outcomes using features about\nan individual, but fail to take into account how individuals can change them.\nConsequently, models can assign fixed predictions that deny individuals\nrecourse to change their outcome. This work develops a new paradigm to identify\nfixed predictions by finding confined regions in which all individuals receive\nfixed predictions. We introduce the first method, ReVer, for this task, using\ntools from mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming. Our approach\ncertifies recourse for out-of-sample data, provides interpretable descriptions\nof confined regions, and runs in seconds on real world datasets. We conduct a\ncomprehensive empirical study of confined regions across diverse applications.\nOur results highlight that existing point-wise verification methods fail to\ndiscover confined regions, while ReVer provably succeeds.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has been playing important roles in drug discovery in\nthe past years by providing (pre-)screening tools for prioritising chemical\ncompounds to pass through wet lab experiments. One of the main ML tasks in drug\ndiscovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)\nmodels, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an\nactivity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution,\nmetabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound\nbehaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods\nexist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's\npersonalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since\nthe chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact\nleads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by\nthe model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to\nsolve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand.\nAlthough an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist\ncheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few\nworks related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces\nAuto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical\nADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic\nProgramming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or\nbetter predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP\nmethod, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property\nprediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's\nevolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and\ninterpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.",

These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and\nmight make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an\ninitial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the\nmodel's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and\npropose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful\ncontent is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training\nmethod effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at\nall times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it\nenables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while\nmarginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's\nutility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input\nprompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In\naddition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces\ncorrelated failures when combined with a classifier.

One popular\nway of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized\nsupervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified\nthrough measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In\nprinciple, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As\na necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of\ncalibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to\ndetermine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that\nis calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework\nallows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that\ndifferent ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the\ninput space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules,\nwhich inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable,\nkernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric\ntesting procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level\nvariability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.",

In this work, we propose a novel training scheme and a\ntransformer-based architecture, collectively referred to as TimePFN, for\nmultivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting. TimePFN is based on the concept of\nPrior-data Fitted Networks (PFN), which aims to approximate Bayesian inference.\nOur approach consists of (1) generating synthetic MTS data through diverse\nGaussian process kernels and the linear coregionalization method, and (2) a\nnovel MTS architecture capable of utilizing both temporal and cross-channel\ndependencies across all input patches. We evaluate TimePFN on several benchmark\ndatasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art\nmodels for MTS forecasting in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably,\nfine-tuning TimePFN with as few as 500 data points nearly matches full dataset\ntraining error, and even 50 data points yield competitive results. We also find\nthat TimePFN exhibits strong univariate forecasting performance, attesting to\nits generalization ability.

Recognizing the documented susceptibility of real-valued\nneural networks to such attacks and the comparative robustness of quantized\nneural networks (QNNs), in this work, we introduce BFAVerifier, the first\nverification framework designed to formally verify the absence of bit-flip\nattacks or to identify all vulnerable parameters in a sound and rigorous\nmanner.

If\nthe reachability analysis fails to prove the resilience of such attacks, then\nwe encode this verification problem into an equivalent MILP problem which can\nbe solved by off-the-shelf solvers.

As a result, developing\ninterpretability methods for MLLMs is crucial for improving alignment quality\nand efficiency. In text-only LLMs, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have gained\nattention for their ability to interpret latent representations. However,\nextending SAEs to multimodal settings presents new challenges due to modality\nfusion and the difficulty of isolating cross-modal representations.

Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal feature weighting, SAE-V provides\nan intrinsic data filtering mechanism to enhance model alignment without\nrequiring additional models.

    "abstract": "What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical\ntest proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial\nagent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral\nsimilarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different\ninternal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling\nbiological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond\nbehavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a\nmodel's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This\nposition paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is\nincomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI\nTuring Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and\n\\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations\nthat are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured\nindividual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and\nthe brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain.\nWhile the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the\nonly universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for\nevaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift\nthe discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic\nand testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations,\nproviding a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Generally,\nevaluating the quality of an RTL design demands full synthesis via electronic\ndesign automation (EDA) tool is time-consuming process that is not well-suited\nto rapid design iteration and optimization. Although recent breakthroughs in\nmachine Learning (ML) have brought early prediction models, these methods\nusually do not provide robust and generalizable solutions with respect to a\nwide range of RTL designs. This paper proposes a pre-synthesis framework that\nmakes early estimation of power, performance and area (PPA) metrics directly\nfrom the hardware description language (HDL) code making direct use of library\nfiles instead of toggle files. The proposed framework introduces a bit-level\nrepresentation referred to as the simple operator graph (SOG), which uses\nsingle-bit operators to generate a generalized and flexible structure that\nclosely mirrors the characteristics of post synthesis design. The proposed\nmodel bridges the RTL and post-synthesis design, which will help in precisely\npredicting key metrics. The proposed tree-based ML framework shows superior\npredictive performance PPA estimation. Validation is carried out on 147\ndistinct RTL designs.

We identify legal\nchallenges and shortcomings in provisions related to robustness and\ncybersecurity for high-risk AI systems (Art. 15 AIA) and general-purpose AI\nmodels (Art. 55 AIA). We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand\nresilience against performance disruptions.

    "abstract": "Due to the remarkable reasoning ability, Large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance in knowledge graph question answering\n(KGQA) tasks, which find answers to natural language questions over knowledge\ngraphs (KGs). To alleviate the hallucinations and lack of knowledge issues of\nLLMs, existing methods often retrieve the question-related information from KGs\nto enrich the input context. However, most methods focus on retrieving the\nrelevant information while ignoring the importance of different types of\nknowledge in reasoning, which degrades their performance. To this end, this\npaper reformulates the KGQA problem as a graphical model and proposes a\nthree-stage framework named the Evidence Path Enhanced Reasoning Model (EPERM)\nfor KGQA. In the first stage, EPERM uses the fine-tuned LLM to retrieve a\nsubgraph related to the question from the original knowledge graph. In the\nsecond stage, EPERM filters out the evidence paths that faithfully support the\nreasoning of the questions, and score their importance in reasoning. Finally,\nEPERM uses the weighted evidence paths to reason the final answer. Since\nconsidering the importance of different structural information in KGs for\nreasoning, EPERM can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs in KGQA tasks.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that EPERM achieves\nsuperior performances in KGQA tasks.",

To address these issues, researchers have proposed\nadversarial perturbation-based protection techniques. However, these methods\nhave notable limitations, including insufficient robustness against data\ntransformations and the inability to fully eliminate identifiable features of\nprotected objects in the generated output. In this paper, we introduce\nPersGuard, a novel backdoor-based approach that prevents malicious\npersonalization of specific images. Unlike traditional adversarial perturbation\nmethods, PersGuard implant backdoor triggers into pre-trained T2I models,\npreventing the generation of customized outputs for designated protected images\nwhile allowing normal personalization for unprotected ones. Unfortunately,\nexisting backdoor methods for T2I diffusion models fail to be applied to\npersonalization scenarios due to the different backdoor objectives and the\npotential backdoor elimination during downstream fine-tuning processes. To\naddress these, we propose three novel backdoor objectives specifically designed\nfor personalization scenarios, coupled with backdoor retention loss engineered\nto resist downstream fine-tuning. These components are integrated into a\nunified optimization framework.

The key\nexpression re-sampling framework is designed to identify the key expression,\nthereby mitigating the potential confusion caused by non-target expressions.\nRDFER employs two sequence models with the objective of disentangling\nshort-term facial movements and long-term emotional changes. The proposed\nmethod has been shown to outperform current State-Of-The-Art approaches in DFER\nthrough extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets such as DFEW and\nFERV39K. A comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights and observations\nregarding the proposed agreement. This work has significant implications for\nthe field of dynamic facial expression recognition and promotes the further\ndevelopment of the field of noise-consistent robust learning in dynamic facial\nexpression recognition.

In this framework, each of the $M$ agents has a unique reward\ndistribution over $K$ arms, and in $T$ rounds, they can observe the reward of\nthe arm they pull only if no other agent pulls that arm. The goal is to\nmaximize the total utility by querying the minimal necessary hints without\npulling arms, achieving time-independent regret. We study HMA2B in both\ncentralized and decentralized setups. Our main centralized algorithm, GP-HCLA,\nwhich is an extension of HCLA, uses a central decision-maker for arm-pulling\nand hint queries, achieving $O(M^4K)$ regret with $O(MK\\log T)$ adaptive hints.\nIn decentralized setups, we propose two algorithms, HD-ETC and EBHD-ETC, that\nallow agents to choose actions independently through collision-based\ncommunication and query hints uniformly until stopping, yielding $O(M^3K^2)$\nregret with $O(M^3K\\log T)$ hints, where the former requires knowledge of the\nminimum gap and the latter does not.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a significant\nsecurity threat, allowing adversaries to implant hidden malicious behaviors\nduring the model training phase. Pre-processing-based defense, which is one of\nthe most important defense paradigms, typically focuses on input\ntransformations or backdoor trigger inversion (BTI) to deactivate or eliminate\nembedded backdoor triggers during the inference process. However, these methods\nsuffer from inherent limitations: transformation-based defenses often fail to\nbalance model utility and defense performance, while BTI-based defenses\nstruggle to accurately reconstruct trigger patterns without prior knowledge. In\nthis paper, we propose REFINE, an inversion-free backdoor defense method based\non model reprogramming. REFINE consists of two key components: \\textbf{(1)} an\ninput transformation module that disrupts both benign and backdoor patterns,\ngenerating new benign features; and \\textbf{(2)} an output remapping module\nthat redefines the model's output domain to guide the input transformations\neffectively. By further integrating supervised contrastive loss, REFINE\nenhances the defense capabilities while maintaining model utility. Extensive\nexperiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nREFINE and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks.",

Unlike\ntraditional cloud-native stacks, AIBrix follows a co-design philosophy,\nensuring every layer of the infrastructure is purpose-built for seamless\nintegration with inference engines like vLLM. AIBrix introduces several key\ninnovations to reduce inference costs and enhance performance including\nhigh-density LoRA management for dynamic adapter scheduling, LLM-specific\nautoscalers, and prefix-aware, load-aware routing. To further improve\nefficiency, AIBrix incorporates a distributed KV cache, boosting token reuse\nacross nodes, leading to a 50% increase in throughput and a 70% reduction in\ninference latency. AIBrix also supports unified AI runtime which streamlines\nmodel management while maintaining vendor-agnostic engine compatibility. For\nlarge-scale multi-node inference, AIBrix employs hybrid orchestration --\nleveraging Kubernetes for coarse-grained scheduling and Ray for fine-grained\nexecution -- to balance efficiency and flexibility. Additionally, an SLO-driven\nGPU optimizer dynamically adjusts resource allocations, optimizing\nheterogeneous serving to maximize cost efficiency while maintaining service\nguarantees. Finally, AIBrix enhances system reliability with AI accelerator\ndiagnostic tools, enabling automated failure detection and mock-up testing to\nimprove fault resilience.

However, LLMs\nstruggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own\nreasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making\nthem vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval\nscenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in\nthe political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete,\nor polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval\nsetting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers\nfrom gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world\nconditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate\nthe robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior\nbenchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval\ncorpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation.\nIt categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and\nirrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how\nwell RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark\nexperiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested\nLLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no\nretrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To\nthe best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically\nassess RAG robustness against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark\nwill drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized\ndatasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications.",

Our work is\ndistinguished from previous attempts by integrating both satisfaction and\noptimization problems within a unified dataset using a solver-agnostic modeling\nlanguage. To achieve this, we leverage MiniZinc's solver-and-paradigm-agnostic\nmodeling capabilities to formulate these problems. Using the Text2Zinc dataset,\nwe conduct comprehensive baseline experiments to compare execution and solution\naccuracy across several methods, including off-the-shelf prompting strategies,\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and a compositional approach. Additionally, we\nexplore the effectiveness of intermediary representations, specifically\nknowledge graphs. Our findings indicate that LLMs are not yet a push-button\ntechnology to model combinatorial problems from text.

However, the critical nature of medical\ndecision-making raises several concerns about relying on external software. Key\nissues include potential variations in image modalities and the medical devices\nused to obtain these images, potential legal issues, and adversarial attacks.\nFortunately, the open-source nature of machine learning research has made\nfoundation models publicly available and straightforward to use for medical\napplications. This accessibility allows medical institutions to train their own\nAI-based models, thereby mitigating the aforementioned concerns. Given this\ncontext, an important question arises: how much data do medical institutions\nneed to train effective AI models? In this study, we explore this question in\nrelation to breast cancer detection, a particularly contested area due to the\nprevalence of this disease, which affects approximately 1 in every 8 women.\nThrough large-scale experiments on various patient sizes in the training set,\nwe show that medical institutions do not need a decade's worth of MRI images to\ntrain an AI model that performs competitively with the state-of-the-art,\nprovided the model leverages foundation models. Furthermore, we observe that\nfor patient counts greater than 50, the number of patients in the training set\nhas a negligible impact on the performance of models and that simple ensembles\nfurther improve the results without additional complexity.",

However, SOC analysts face challenges in handling adaptive adversarial\ntactics, requiring intelligent decision-support frameworks. We propose a\nCognitive Hierarchy Theory-driven Deep Q-Network (CHT-DQN) framework that\nmodels interactive decision-making between SOC analysts and AI-driven APT bots.\nThe SOC analyst (defender) operates at cognitive level-1, anticipating attacker\nstrategies, while the APT bot (attacker) follows a level-0 policy. By\nincorporating CHT into DQN, our framework enhances adaptive SOC defense using\nAttack Graph (AG)-based reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments across\nvarying AG complexities show that CHT-DQN consistently achieves higher data\nprotection and lower action discrepancies compared to standard DQN. A\ntheoretical lower bound further confirms its superiority as AG complexity\nincreases. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk\n(MTurk) reveals that SOC analysts using CHT-DQN-derived transition\nprobabilities align more closely with adaptive attackers, leading to better\ndefense outcomes. Moreover, human behavior aligns with Prospect Theory (PT) and\nCumulative Prospect Theory (CPT): participants are less likely to reselect\nfailed actions and more likely to persist with successful ones. This asymmetry\nreflects amplified loss sensitivity and biased probability weighting --\nunderestimating gains after failure and overestimating continued success.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models,\nparticularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous\ndriving. Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in\nreal-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following\nthis idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation\nOver Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic\nfor autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a\n'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this\nattack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized\non a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a\ncomprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches\ntrained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S,\nPIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the\nSegformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of\nour analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study\nreveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs.\nTransformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude\nthat although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images\nof any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular\nmodel are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true\nfor both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that\nfor CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike\nViTs.

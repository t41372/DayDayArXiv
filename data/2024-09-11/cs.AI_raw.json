Without resorting to preprogramming or special tricks, their\nintelligence grows as they learn from experience, and to ordinary people, they\ncan appear human-like in conversation. This means that they can pass the Turing\ntest, and that we are now living in one of many possible Turing futures where\nmachines can pass for what they are not. However, the learning machines that\nTuring imagined would pass his imitation tests were machines inspired by the\nnatural development of the low-energy human cortex.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions for\nAutonomous Vehicles using Computer Vision and Deep Neural Networks are\npromising. However, the black-box nature of DNNs poses challenges in\nunderstanding how the model works and how input features contribute to final\npredictions. This lack of interpretability delimits the trust in model\nperformance and hinders informed decisions on feature selection,\nrepresentation, and model optimisation; thereby affecting the efficacy of\nfuture research in the field. To address this, we introduce Context-aware\nPermutation Feature Importance (CAPFI), a novel approach tailored for\npedestrian intention prediction. CAPFI enables more interpretability and\nreliable assessments of feature importance by leveraging subdivided scenario\ncontexts, mitigating the randomness of feature values through targeted\nshuffling. This aims to reduce variance and prevent biased estimations in\nimportance scores during permutations. We divide the Pedestrian Intention\nEstimation (PIE) dataset into 16 comparable context sets, measure the baseline\nperformance of five distinct neural network architectures for intention\nprediction in each context, and assess input feature importance using CAPFI. We\nobserved nuanced differences among models across various contextual\ncharacteristics. The research reveals the critical role of pedestrian bounding\nboxes and ego-vehicle speed in predicting pedestrian intentions, and potential\nprediction biases due to the speed feature through cross-context permutation\nevaluation. We propose an alternative feature representation by considering\nproximity change rate for rendering dynamic pedestrian-vehicle locomotion,\nthereby enhancing the contributions of input features to intention prediction.\nThese findings underscore the importance of contextual features and their\ndiversity to develop accurate and robust intent-predictive models.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we explore evaluation of LLM capabilities. We present\nmeasurements of GPT-4 performance on several deterministic tasks; each task\ninvolves a basic calculation and takes as input parameter some element drawn\nfrom a large well-defined population (e.g., count elements in a list, multiply\ntwo k-digit numbers, etc). We examine several conditions per-task and perform\nenough trials so that statistically significant differences can be detected.\nThis allows us to investigate the sensitivity of task-accuracy both to query\nphrasing and input parameter population. We find that seemingly trivial\nmodifications in the task-prompt or input population can yield differences far\nlarger than can be explained by sampling effects. For example, performance on a\nsimple list-counting task varies with query-phrasing and list-length, but also\nwith list composition (i.e., the thing-to-be-counted) and object frequency\n(e.g., success when an element accounts for $\\approx$ 50\\% of a list is\ndifferent from when it accounts for $\\approx$ 70\\% etc).\n  We conclude that efforts to quantify LLM capabilities easily succumb to the\nlanguage-as-fixed-effect fallacy, where experimental observations are\nimproperly generalized beyond what the data supports. A consequence appears to\nbe that intuitions that have been formed based on interactions with humans form\na very unreliable guide as to which input modifications should ``make no\ndifference'' to LLM performance.",

    "abstract": "Machine/deep learning models have been widely adopted for predicting the\nconfiguration performance of software systems. However, a crucial yet\nunaddressed challenge is how to cater for the sparsity inherited from the\nconfiguration landscape: the influence of configuration options (features) and\nthe distribution of data samples are highly sparse. In this paper, we propose a\nmodel-agnostic and sparsity-robust framework for predicting configuration\nperformance, dubbed DaL, based on the new paradigm of dividable learning that\nbuilds a model via \"divide-and-learn\". To handle sample sparsity, the samples\nfrom the configuration landscape are divided into distant divisions, for each\nof which we build a sparse local model, e.g., regularized Hierarchical\nInteraction Neural Network, to deal with the feature sparsity. A newly given\nconfiguration would then be assigned to the right model of division for the\nfinal prediction. Further, DaL adaptively determines the optimal number of\ndivisions required for a system and sample size without any extra training or\nprofiling. Experiment results from 12 real-world systems and five sets of\ntraining data reveal that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, DaL\nperforms no worse than the best counterpart on 44 out of 60 cases with up to\n1.61x improvement on accuracy; requires fewer samples to reach the same/better\naccuracy; and producing acceptable training overhead. In particular, the\nmechanism that adapted the parameter d can reach the optimal value for 76.43%\nof the individual runs. The result also confirms that the paradigm of dividable\nlearning is more suitable than other similar paradigms such as ensemble\nlearning for predicting configuration performance. Practically, DaL\nconsiderably improves different global models when using them as the underlying\nlocal models, which further strengthens its flexibility.",

As an emerging research topic, ICRL has received\nconsiderable attention in recent years. This article presents a categorical\nsurvey of the latest advances in ICRL. It serves as a comprehensive reference\nfor machine learning researchers and practitioners, as well as starters seeking\nto comprehend the definitions, advancements, and important challenges in ICRL.\nWe begin by formally defining the problem and outlining the algorithmic\nframework that facilitates constraint inference across various scenarios. These\ninclude deterministic or stochastic environments, environments with limited\ndemonstrations, and multiple agents. For each context, we illustrate the\ncritical challenges and introduce a series of fundamental methods to tackle\nthese issues. This survey encompasses discrete, virtual, and realistic\nenvironments for evaluating ICRL agents. We also delve into the most pertinent\napplications of ICRL, such as autonomous driving, robot control, and sports\nanalytics. To stimulate continuing research, we conclude the survey with a\ndiscussion of key unresolved questions in ICRL that can effectively foster a\nbridge between theoretical understanding and practical industrial applications.\nThe papers referenced in this survey can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Jasonxu1225/Awesome-Constraint-Inference-in-RL.",

    "abstract": "Solving combinatorial optimization problems involve satisfying a set of hard\nconstraints while optimizing some objectives. In this context, exact or\napproximate methods can be used. While exact methods guarantee the optimal\nsolution, they often come with an exponential running time as opposed to\napproximate methods that trade the solutions quality for a better running time.\nIn this context, we tackle the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP). The NSP consist\nin assigning nurses to daily shifts within a planning horizon such that\nworkload constraints are satisfied while hospitals costs and nurses preferences\nare optimized. To solve the NSP, we propose implicit and explicit approaches.\nIn the implicit solving approach, we rely on Machine Learning methods using\nhistorical data to learn and generate new solutions through the constraints and\nobjectives that may be embedded in the learned patterns. To quantify the\nquality of using our implicit approach in capturing the embedded constraints\nand objectives, we rely on the Frobenius Norm, a quality measure used to\ncompute the average error between the generated solutions and historical data.\nTo compensate for the uncertainty related to the implicit approach given that\nthe constraints and objectives may not be concretely visible in the produced\nsolutions, we propose an alternative explicit approach where we first model the\nNSP using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework. Then we develop\nStochastic Local Search methods and a new Branch and Bound algorithm enhanced\nwith constraint propagation techniques and variables/values ordering\nheuristics. Since our implicit approach may not guarantee the feasibility or\noptimality of the generated solution, we propose a data-driven approach to\npassively learn the NSP as a constraint network. The learned constraint\nnetwork, formulated as a CSP, will then be solved using the methods we listed\nearlier.",

    "abstract": "As network security threats continue to evolve, safeguarding Machine Learning\n(ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from adversarial attacks\nis crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and\npresents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS) metric that identifies NIDS\nfeatures susceptible to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. By\nquantifying a feature's susceptibility to perturbations within the\nproblem-space, the PS facilitates the selection of features that are inherently\nmore robust against evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS during the feature\nselection phase. These features exhibit natural resilience to perturbations, as\nthey are heavily constrained by the problem-space limitations and correlations\nof the NIDS domain. Furthermore, manipulating these features may either disrupt\nthe malicious function of evasion adversarial attacks on NIDS or render the\nnetwork traffic invalid for processing (or both). This proposed novel approach\nemploys a fresh angle by leveraging network domain constraints as a defense\nmechanism against problem-space evasion adversarial attacks targeting ML-NIDS.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-guided feature selection defense in\nenhancing NIDS robustness. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS\nmodels and public datasets show that selecting only robust features (low-PS\nfeatures) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing\nvulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the\ninformation of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive\nlearning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning.\nIndeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it\nlearns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation\nspace. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared\nor redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can\narise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal\nlearning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single\nmultimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we\npropose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual\ninformation between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of\ninformation naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate\nmultimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled\nand in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM\neffectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between\nmodalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/Duplums/CoMM",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces SGCode, a flexible prompt-optimizing system to generate\nsecure code with large language models (LLMs). SGCode integrates recent\nprompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through\nfront-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which\nis free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3)\neasily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing\ninsights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server\nwith PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and\nsecurity tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network\nto detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive\nexperiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights\ninto the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system\ncost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is\navailable at: https://sgcode.codes/.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), trained on multimodal big datasets,\nhave significantly advanced AI by excelling in vision-language tasks. However,\nthese models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreak\nattacks, which bypass safety protocols and cause the model to generate\nmisleading or harmful responses. This vulnerability stems from both the\ninherent susceptibilities of LLMs and the expanded attack surface introduced by\nthe visual modality. We propose Sim-CLIP+, a novel defense mechanism that\nadversarially fine-tunes the CLIP vision encoder by leveraging a Siamese\narchitecture. This approach maximizes cosine similarity between perturbed and\nclean samples, facilitating resilience against adversarial manipulations.\nSim-CLIP+ offers a plug-and-play solution, allowing seamless integration into\nexisting LVLM architectures as a robust vision encoder. Unlike previous\ndefenses, our method requires no structural modifications to the LVLM and\nincurs minimal computational overhead. Sim-CLIP+ demonstrates effectiveness\nagainst both gradient-based adversarial attacks and various jailbreak\ntechniques. We evaluate Sim-CLIP+ against three distinct jailbreak attack\nstrategies and perform clean evaluations using standard downstream datasets,\nincluding COCO for image captioning and OKVQA for visual question answering.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Sim-CLIP+ maintains high clean accuracy\nwhile substantially improving robustness against both gradient-based\nadversarial attacks and jailbreak techniques.

Federated learning (FL) provides a paradigm that can\nlearn from distributed datasets across clients without requiring them to share\ndata, which can help mitigate privacy and data ownership issues. In FL,\nsub-optimal convergence caused by data heterogeneity is common among data from\ndifferent health centers due to the variety in data collection protocols and\npatient demographics across centers. Through experimentation in this study, we\nshow that data heterogeneity leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting\nduring local training. We propose FedImpres which alleviates catastrophic\nforgetting by restoring synthetic data that represents the global information\nas federated impression. To achieve this, we distill the global model resulting\nfrom each communication round.

    "abstract": "Interactive artificial intelligence in the motion control field is an\ninteresting topic, especially when universal knowledge is adaptive to multiple\ntasks and universal environments. Despite there being increasing efforts in the\nfield of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the aid of transformers, most of them\nmight be limited by the offline training pipeline, which prohibits exploration\nand generalization abilities. To address this limitation, we propose the\nframework of Online Decision MetaMorphFormer (ODM) which aims to achieve\nself-awareness, environment recognition, and action planning through a unified\nmodel architecture. Motivated by cognitive and behavioral psychology, an ODM\nagent is able to learn from others, recognize the world, and practice itself\nbased on its own experience. ODM can also be applied to any arbitrary agent\nwith a multi-joint body, located in different environments, and trained with\ndifferent types of tasks using large-scale pre-trained datasets. Through the\nuse of pre-trained datasets, ODM can quickly warm up and learn the necessary\nknowledge to perform the desired task, while the target environment continues\nto reinforce the universal policy. Extensive online experiments as well as\nfew-shot and zero-shot environmental tests are used to verify ODM's performance\nand generalization ability.

While\nadversarial training is an effective method for enhancing model robustness\nagainst such attacks, no prior studies have focused on its application to\nend-to-end AD models. In this paper, we take the first step in adversarial\ntraining for end-to-end AD models and present a novel Module-wise Adaptive\nAdversarial Training (MA2T). However, extending conventional adversarial\ntraining to this context is highly non-trivial, as different stages within the\nmodel have distinct objectives and are strongly interconnected. To address\nthese challenges, MA2T first introduces Module-wise Noise Injection, which\ninjects noise before the input of different modules, targeting training models\nwith the guidance of overall objectives rather than each independent module\nloss. Additionally, we introduce Dynamic Weight Accumulation Adaptation, which\nincorporates accumulated weight changes to adaptively learn and adjust the loss\nweights of each module based on their contributions (accumulated reduction\nrates) for better balance and robust training. To demonstrate the efficacy of\nour defense, we conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used nuScenes\ndataset across several end-to-end AD models under both white-box and black-box\nattacks, where our method outperforms other baselines by large margins\n(+5-10%).

    "abstract": "Background: Health 3.0 allows decision making to be based on longitudinal\ndata from multiple institutions, from across the patient's healthcare journey.\nIn such a distributed setting, blockchain smart contracts can act as neutral\nintermediaries to implement trustworthy decision making.\n  Objective: In a distributed setting, transmitted data will be structured\nusing standards (such as HL7 FHIR) for semantic interoperability. In turn, the\nsmart contract will require interoperability with this standard, implement a\ncomplex communication setup (e.g., using oracles), and be developed using\nblockchain languages (e.g., Solidity). We propose the encoding of smart\ncontract logic using a high-level semantic Knowledge Graph, using concepts from\nthe domain standard. We then deploy this semantic KG on blockchain.\n  Methods: Off-chain, a code generation pipeline compiles the KG into a\nconcrete smart contract, which is then deployed on-chain. Our pipeline targets\nan intermediary bridge representation, which can be transpiled into a specific\nblockchain language. Our choice avoids on-chain rule engines, with\nunpredictable and likely higher computational cost; it is thus in line with the\neconomic rules of blockchain.\n  Results: We applied our code generation approach to generate smart contracts\nfor 3 health insurance cases from Medicare. We discuss the suitability of our\napproach - the need for a neutral intermediary - for a number of healthcare use\ncases. Our evaluation finds that the generated contracts perform well in terms\nof correctness and execution cost (\"gas\") on blockchain.\n  Conclusions: We showed that it is feasible to automatically generate smart\ncontract code based on a semantic KG, in a way that respects the economic rules\nof blockchain.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, social media platforms have been used for information\ndissemination and consumption. While a major portion of the content is posted\nto promote citizen journalism and public awareness, some content is posted to\nmislead users. Among different content types such as text, images, and videos,\nmemes (text overlaid on images) are particularly prevalent and can serve as\npowerful vehicles for propaganda, hate, and humor. In the current literature,\nthere have been efforts to individually detect such content in memes. However,\nthe study of their intersection is very limited. In this study, we explore the\nintersection between propaganda and hate in memes using a multi-agent LLM-based\napproach. We extend the propagandistic meme dataset with coarse and\nfine-grained hate labels. Our finding suggests that there is an association\nbetween propaganda and hate in memes. We provide detailed experimental results\nthat can serve as a baseline for future studies. We will make the experimental\nresources publicly available to the community\n(https://github.com/firojalam/propaganda-and-hateful-memes).",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are distinguished by their\nmultimodal comprehensive ability and widely used in many real-world\napplications including GPT-4o, autonomous driving and robotics. Despite their\nimpressive performance, the multimodal inputs always incur long context. The\ninference under long context requires caching massive Key and Value states (KV\ncache) of previous tokens, which introduces high latency and excessive memory\nconsumption. Due to this reason, it is challenging to deploy streaming\ninference of MLLMs on edge devices, which largely constrains the power and\nusage of MLLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce\nInf-MLLM, an efficient inference framework for MLLMs, which enable streaming\ninference of MLLM on a single GPU with infinite context. Inf-MLLM is based on\nour key observation of the attention pattern in both LLMs and MLLMs called\n\"attention saddles\". Thanks to the newly discovered attention pattern, Inf-MLLM\nmaintains a size-constrained KV cache by dynamically caching recent tokens and\nrelevant tokens. Furthermore, Inf-MLLM proposes attention bias, a novel\napproach to enable MLLMs to capture long-term dependency. We show that Inf-MLLM\nenables multiple LLMs and MLLMs to achieve stable performance over 4M-token\nlong texts and multi-round conversations with 1-hour-long videos on a single\nGPU. In addition, Inf-MLLM exhibits superior streaming reasoning quality than\nexisting methods such as StreamingLLM and 2x speedup than H2O.",

Instead, verified RDF statements are compared to chunks\nof external documents retrieved through a web search or Wikipedia. To assess\nthe possible application of this workflow on biosciences content, we evaluated\n1,719 positive statements from the BioRED dataset and the same number of newly\ngenerated negative statements. The resulting precision is 88%, and recall is\n44%. This indicates that the method requires human oversight. We demonstrate\nthe method on Wikidata, where a SPARQL query is used to automatically retrieve\nstatements needing verification.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) coordinates multiple devices to collaboratively train\na shared model while preserving data privacy. However, large memory footprint\nand high energy consumption during the training process excludes the low-end\ndevices from contributing to the global model with their own data, which\nseverely deteriorates the model performance in real-world scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose FedStitch, a hierarchical coordination framework for\nheterogeneous federated learning with pre-trained blocks. Unlike the\ntraditional approaches that train the global model from scratch, for a new\ntask, FedStitch composes the global model via stitching pre-trained blocks.\nSpecifically, each participating client selects the most suitable block based\non their local data from the candidate pool composed of blocks from pre-trained\nmodels. The server then aggregates the optimal block for stitching. This\nprocess iterates until a new stitched network is generated. Except for the new\ntraining paradigm, FedStitch consists of the following three core components:\n1) an RL-weighted aggregator, 2) a search space optimizer deployed on the\nserver side, and 3) a local energy optimizer deployed on each participating\nclient. The RL-weighted aggregator helps to select the right block in the\nnon-IID scenario, while the search space optimizer continuously reduces the\nsize of the candidate block pool during stitching. Meanwhile, the local energy\noptimizer is designed to minimize energy consumption of each client while\nguaranteeing the overall training progress. The results demonstrate that\ncompared to existing approaches, FedStitch improves the model accuracy up to\n20.93%. At the same time, it achieves up to 8.12% speedup, reduces the memory\nfootprint up to 79.5%, and achieves 89.41% energy saving at most during the\nlearning procedure.",

Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields\n(NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of\nthermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS)\nprevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we\npropose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering\nhigh-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB\ncamera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately\naligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D\nGaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce\nseveral multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing\nconstraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality.\nBesides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a\nhand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal\nscene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that\nThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and\nimproves the rendering quality of RGB images.

Despite\ntheir utility, MD simulations are expensive, owing to the high dimensionality\nof molecular systems. Interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality\n(iMD-VR) has recently been developed as a 'human-in-the-loop' strategy, which\nleverages high-performance computing to accelerate the researcher's ability to\nsolve the hyperdimensional sampling problem. By providing an immersive 3D\nenvironment that enables visualization and manipulation of real-time molecular\nmotion, iMD-VR enables researchers and students to efficiently and intuitively\nexplore and navigate these complex, high-dimensional systems. iMD-VR platforms\noffer a unique opportunity to quickly generate rich datasets that capture human\nexperts' spatial insight regarding molecular structure and function. This paper\nexplores the possibility of employing user-generated iMD-VR datasets to train\nAI agents via imitation learning (IL). IL is an important technique in robotics\nthat enables agents to mimic complex behaviors from expert demonstrations, thus\ncircumventing the need for explicit programming or intricate reward design. We\nreview the utilization of IL for manipulation tasks in robotics and discuss how\niMD-VR recordings could be used to train IL models for solving specific\nmolecular 'tasks'. We then investigate how such approaches could be applied to\nthe data captured from iMD-VR recordings. Finally, we outline the future\nresearch directions and potential challenges of using AI agents to augment\nhuman expertise to efficiently navigate conformational spaces, highlighting how\nthis approach could provide valuable insight across domains such as materials\nscience, protein engineering, and computer-aided drug design.",

The DWI signal can be\nanalysed with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model to estimate the\ndirectionality of water diffusion within voxels. Several scalar metrics,\nincluding axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity\n(RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA), can be further derived from DTI to\nquantitatively summarise the microstructural integrity of brain tissue. These\nscalar metrics have played an important role in understanding the organisation\nand health of brain tissue at a microscopic level in clinical studies. However,\nreliable DTI metrics rely on DWI acquisitions with high gradient directions,\nwhich often go beyond the commonly used clinical protocols. To enhance the\nutility of clinically acquired DWI and save scanning time for robust DTI\nanalysis, this work proposes DirGeo-DTI, a deep learning-based method to\nestimate reliable DTI metrics even from a set of DWIs acquired with the minimum\ntheoretical number (6) of gradient directions. DirGeo-DTI leverages directional\nencoding and geometric constraints to facilitate the training process.

    "abstract": "Federated instruction tuning enables multiple clients to collaboratively\nfine-tune a shared large language model (LLM) that can follow humans'\ninstructions without directly sharing raw data. However, existing literature\nimpractically requires that all the clients readily hold instruction-tuning\ndata (i.e., structured instruction-response pairs), which necessitates massive\nhuman annotations since clients' data is usually unstructured text instead.\nAddressing this, we propose a novel and flexible framework FedIT-U2S, which can\nautomatically transform unstructured corpus into structured data for federated\ninstruction tuning. FedIT-U2S consists two key steps: (1) few-shot\ninstruction-tuning data generation, where each unstructured data piece together\nwith several examples is combined to prompt an LLM in generating an\ninstruction-response pair. To further enhance the flexibility, a\nretrieval-based example selection technique is proposed, where the examples are\nautomatically selected based on the relatedness between the client's data piece\nand example pool, bypassing the need of determining examples in advance. (2) A\ntypical federated instruction tuning process based on the generated data.\nOverall, FedIT-U2S can be applied to diverse scenarios as long as the client\nholds valuable text corpus, broadening the application scope of federated\ninstruction tuning. We conduct a series of experiments on three domains\n(medicine, knowledge, and math), showing that our proposed FedIT-U2S can\nconsistently and significantly brings improvement over the base LLM.",

    "abstract": "Biometric authentication has garnered significant attention as a secure and\nefficient method of identity verification. Among the various modalities, hand\nvein biometrics, including finger vein, palm vein, and dorsal hand vein\nrecognition, offer unique advantages due to their high accuracy, low\nsusceptibility to forgery, and non-intrusiveness. The vein patterns within the\nhand are highly complex and distinct for each individual, making them an ideal\nbiometric identifier. Additionally, hand vein recognition is contactless,\nenhancing user convenience and hygiene compared to other modalities such as\nfingerprint or iris recognition. Furthermore, the veins are internally located,\nrendering them less susceptible to damage or alteration, thus enhancing the\nsecurity and reliability of the biometric system. The combination of these\nfactors makes hand vein biometrics a highly effective and secure method for\nidentity verification.

TinyML is an emerging field that deploys\nmachine learning models on resource-constrained devices such as\nmicrocontrollers, enabling intelligent applications like voice recognition,\nanomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and sensor data processing in\nenvironments where traditional machine learning models are not feasible. The\nalgorithm solve the challenge of catastrophic forgetting through the use of\nknowledge distillation to create a small, distilled dataset.

Previous research mainly focuses on selecting\nindividual high-quality instructions. However, these works overlooked the joint\ninteractions and dependencies between different categories of instructions,\nleading to suboptimal selection strategies. Moreover, the nature of these\ninteraction patterns remains largely unexplored, let alone optimize the\ninstruction set with regard to them. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we: (1)\nsystemically investigate interaction and dependency patterns between different\ncategories of instructions, (2) manage to optimize the instruction set\nconcerning the interaction patterns using a linear programming-based method,\nand optimize the learning schema of SFT using an instruction dependency\ntaxonomy guided curriculum learning.

Recently, generative\nmodels, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating\nrealistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional\ngeneration using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on\ntheir corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical\nutility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR\nimages by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g.,\nprescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts\ndisease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the\nprevious CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate\nthe performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical\nconsistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our\nframework generates high-quality, realistic future images that effectively\ncapture potential temporal changes. This suggests that our framework could be\nfurther developed to support clinical decision-making and provide valuable\ninsights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/dek924/EHRXDiff.",

From a broader perspective, this question calls for an\ninvestigation of the computational power of LLMs by the classical means of\ncomputability and computational complexity theory, especially the theory of\nautomata. Along these lines, we establish a number of fundamental results.\nFirstly, we argue that any fixed (non-adaptive) LLM is computationally\nequivalent to a, possibly very large, deterministic finite-state transducer.\nThis characterizes the base level of LLMs. We extend this to a key result\nconcerning the simulation of space-bounded Turing machines by LLMs. Secondly,\nwe show that lineages of evolving LLMs are computationally equivalent to\ninteractive Turing machines with advice. The latter finding confirms the\nvalidity of the ECTT for lineages of LLMs. From a computability viewpoint, it\nalso suggests that lineages of LLMs possess super-Turing computational power.\nConsequently, in our computational model knowledge generation is in general a\nnon-algorithmic process realized by lineages of LLMs. Finally, we discuss the\nmerits of our findings in the broader context of several related disciplines\nand philosophies.",

The main challenge of these methods is the\ninaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation\ntasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that\nthe reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with\ndifferent rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be\nunreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting\nin Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a\nproper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of\ndetermination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples\nserves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies.

    "abstract": "Fully sparse 3D detection has attracted an increasing interest in the recent\nyears. However, the sparsity of the features in these frameworks challenges the\ngeneration of proposals because of the limited diffusion process. In addition,\nthe quest for efficiency has led to only few work on vision-assisted fully\nsparse models. In this paper, we propose FSMDet (Fully Sparse Multi-modal\nDetection), which use visual information to guide the LiDAR feature diffusion\nprocess while still maintaining the efficiency of the pipeline. Specifically,\nmost of fully sparse works focus on complex customized center fusion\ndiffusion/regression operators. However, we observed that if the adequate\nobject completion is performed, even the simplest interpolation operator leads\nto satisfactory results. Inspired by this observation, we split the\nvision-guided diffusion process into two modules: a Shape Recover Layer\n(SRLayer) and a Self Diffusion Layer (SDLayer). The former uses RGB information\nto recover the shape of the visible part of an object, and the latter uses a\nvisual prior to further spread the features to the center region. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach successfully improves the performance of previous\nfully sparse models that use LiDAR only and reaches SOTA performance in\nmultimodal models. At the same time, thanks to the sparse architecture, our\nmethod can be up to 5 times more efficient than previous SOTA methods in the\ninference process.",

Traditional\nsemi-supervised learning approaches primarily utilize a unified network model\nbased on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and apply consistency\nregularization to mitigate the reliance on extensive annotated data. However,\nthese methods often fall short in capturing the discriminative features of\nunlabeled data and in delineating the long-range dependencies inherent in the\nambiguous boundaries of PSFH within ultrasound images. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel framework, the Dual-Student and Teacher\nCombining CNN and Transformer (DSTCT), which synergistically integrates the\ncapabilities of CNNs and Transformers. Our framework comprises a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) as the teacher and two student mod ls one ViT and one CNN.\nThis dual-student setup enables mutual supervision through the generation of\nboth hard and soft pseudo-labels, with the consistency in their predictions\nbeing refined by minimizing the classifier determinacy discrepancy. The teacher\nmodel further reinforces learning within this architecture through the\nimposition of consistency regularization constraints. To augment the\ngeneralization abilities of our approach, we employ a blend of data and model\nperturbation techniques.

    "abstract": "Jailbreak vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) refer to methods\nthat extract malicious content from the model by carefully crafting prompts or\nsuffixes, which has garnered significant attention from the research community.\nHowever, traditional attack methods, which primarily focus on the semantic\nlevel, are easily detected by the model. These methods overlook the difference\nin the model's alignment protection capabilities at different output stages. To\naddress this issue, we propose an adaptive position pre-fill jailbreak attack\napproach for executing jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Our method leverages the\nmodel's instruction-following capabilities to first output pre-filled safe\ncontent, then exploits its narrative-shifting abilities to generate harmful\ncontent. Extensive black-box experiments demonstrate our method can improve the\nattack success rate by 47% on the widely recognized secure model (Llama2)\ncompared to existing approaches.

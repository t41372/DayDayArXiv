    "abstract": "This research work aims to develop an analytical approach for optimizing team\nformation and predicting team performance in a competitive environment based on\ndata on the competitors' skills prior to the team formation. There are several\napproaches in scientific literature to optimize and predict a team's\nperformance. However, most studies employ fine-grained skill statistics of the\nindividual members or constraints such as teams with a set group of members.\nCurrently, no research tackles the highly constrained domain of the FIRST\nRobotics Competition. This research effort aims to fill this gap by providing\nan analytical method for optimizing and predicting team performance in a\ncompetitive environment while allowing these constraints and only using metrics\non previous team performance, not on each individual member's performance. We\napply our method to the drafting process of the FIRST Robotics competition, a\ndomain in which the skills change year-over-year, team members change\nthroughout the season, each match only has a superficial set of statistics, and\nalliance formation is key to competitive success. First, we develop a method\nthat could extrapolate individual members' performance based on overall team\nperformance. An alliance optimization algorithm is developed to optimize team\nformation and a deep neural network model is trained to predict the winning\nteam, both using highly post-processed real-world data. Our method is able to\nsuccessfully extract individual members' metrics from overall team statistics,\nform competitive teams, and predict the winning team with 84.08% accuracy.",

In this note, we decided to challenge\nthis statement as a small, lighthearted Gedankenexperiment. We ask a simple\nquestion: in a world driven by evolution by natural selection, would neural\nnetworks or humans be likely to evolve first? We compare the\nSolomonoff--Kolmogorov--Chaitin complexity of the two and find neural networks\n(even LLMs) to be significantly simpler than humans. Further, we claim that it\nis unnecessary for any complex human-made equipment to exist for there to be\nneural networks. Neural networks may have evolved as naturally occurring\nobjects before humans did as a form of chemical reaction-based or enzyme-based\ncomputation. Now that we know that neural networks can pass the Turing test and\nsuspect that they may be capable of superintelligence, we ask whether the\nnatural evolution of neural networks could lead from pure evolution by natural\nselection to what we call evolution-bootstrapped simulation. The evolution of\nneural networks does not involve irreducible complexity; would easily allow\nirreducible complexity to exist in the evolution-bootstrapped simulation; is a\nfalsifiable scientific hypothesis; and is independent of / orthogonal to the\nissue of intelligent design.",

    "abstract": "In the field of medical sciences, reliable detection and classification of\nbrain tumors from images remains a formidable challenge due to the rarity of\ntumors within the population of patients. Therefore, the ability to detect\ntumors in anomaly scenarios is paramount for ensuring timely interventions and\nimproved patient outcomes. This study addresses the issue by leveraging deep\nlearning (DL) techniques to detect and classify brain tumors in challenging\nsituations. The curated data set from the National Brain Mapping Lab (NBML)\ncomprises 81 patients, including 30 Tumor cases and 51 Normal cases. The\ndetection and classification pipelines are separated into two consecutive\ntasks. The detection phase involved comprehensive data analysis and\npre-processing to modify the number of image samples and the number of patients\nof each class to anomaly distribution (9 Normal per 1 Tumor) to comply with\nreal world scenarios. Next, in addition to common evaluation metrics for the\ntesting, we employed a novel performance evaluation method called Patient to\nPatient (PTP), focusing on the realistic evaluation of the model. In the\ndetection phase, we fine-tuned a YOLOv8n detection model to detect the tumor\nregion. Subsequent testing and evaluation yielded competitive performance both\nin Common Evaluation Metrics and PTP metrics. Furthermore, using the Data\nEfficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, we distilled a Vision Transformer\n(ViT) model from a fine-tuned ResNet152 as a teacher in the classification\nphase. This approach demonstrates promising strides in reliable tumor detection\nand classification, offering potential advancements in tumor diagnosis for\nreal-world medical imaging scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests that tutors should adopt a strategic approach when\naddressing math errors made by low-efficacy students. Rather than drawing\ndirect attention to the error, tutors should guide the students to identify and\ncorrect their mistakes on their own. While tutor lessons have introduced this\npedagogical skill, human evaluation of tutors applying this strategy is arduous\nand time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) show promise in providing\nreal-time assessment to tutors during their actual tutoring sessions, yet\nlittle is known regarding their accuracy in this context. In this study, we\ninvestigate the capacity of generative AI to evaluate real-life tutors'\nperformance in responding to students making math errors. By analyzing 50\nreal-life tutoring dialogues, we find both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 demonstrate\nproficiency in assessing the criteria related to reacting to students making\nerrors. However, both models exhibit limitations in recognizing instances where\nthe student made an error. Notably, GPT-4 tends to overidentify instances of\nstudents making errors, often attributing student uncertainty or inferring\npotential errors where human evaluators did not. Future work will focus on\nenhancing generalizability by assessing a larger dataset of dialogues and\nevaluating learning transfer. Specifically, we will analyze the performance of\ntutors in real-life scenarios when responding to students' math errors before\nand after lesson completion on this crucial tutoring skill.",

Given a target prompt, Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models (DDPM) are able to generate realistic yet eligible images.\nWith this appealing property, the image translation task has the potential to\nbe free from target image samples for supervision. By using a target text\nprompt for domain adaption, the diffusion model is able to implement zero-shot\nimage-to-image translation advantageously. However, the sampling and inversion\nprocesses of DDPM are stochastic, and thus the inversion process often fail to\nreconstruct the input content. Specifically, the displacement effect will\ngradually accumulated during the diffusion and inversion processes, which led\nto the reconstructed results deviating from the source domain. To make\nreconstruction explicit, we propose a prompt redescription strategy to realize\na mirror effect between the source and reconstructed image in the diffusion\nmodel (MirrorDiffusion). More specifically, a prompt redescription mechanism is\ninvestigated to align the text prompts with latent code at each time step of\nthe Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to pursue a\nstructure-preserving reconstruction. With the revised DDIM inversion,\nMirrorDiffusion is able to realize accurate zero-shot image translation by\nediting optimized text prompts and latent code.

Current alignment techniques have several limitations: (1)\nrequiring a large amount of annotated data; (2) demanding heavy human\ninvolvement; (3) lacking a systematic mechanism to continuously improve. In\nthis work, we study aligning LLMs to a new domain with limited samples (e.g. <\n100). We propose an algorithm that can self-align LLMs iteratively without\nactive human involvement. Unlike existing works, our algorithm relies on\nneither human-crafted instructions nor labeled rewards, significantly reducing\nhuman involvement. In addition, our algorithm can self-improve the alignment\ncontinuously. The key idea is to first retrieve high-quality samples related to\nthe target domain and use them as In-context Learning examples to generate more\nsamples. Then we use the self-generated samples to finetune the LLM\niteratively. We show that our method can unlock the LLMs' self-generalization\nability to perform alignment with near-zero human supervision. We test our\nalgorithm on three benchmarks in safety, truthfulness, and\ninstruction-following, and show good performance in alignment, domain\nadaptability, and scalability.",

Furthermore,\ndifferent from the complex iterative analysis, we propose a new analysis\nprocess which uses the exact version of Inverse Function Theorem to accurately\ndescribe the features learned by the local minimum. With this local minimum, we\nprove that the nonlinear SSL model can capture the label-related feature and\nhidden feature at the same time.

    "abstract": "Sequential decision-making under uncertainty is present in many important\nproblems. Two popular approaches for tackling such problems are reinforcement\nlearning and online search (e.g., Monte Carlo tree search). While the former\nlearns a policy by interacting with the environment (typically done before\nexecution), the latter uses a generative model of the environment to sample\npromising action trajectories at decision time. Decision-making is particularly\nchallenging in non-stationary environments, where the environment in which an\nagent operates can change over time. Both approaches have shortcomings in such\nsettings -- on the one hand, policies learned before execution become stale\nwhen the environment changes and relearning takes both time and computational\neffort. Online search, on the other hand, can return sub-optimal actions when\nthere are limitations on allowed runtime. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textit{Policy-Augmented Monte Carlo tree search} (PA-MCTS), which combines\naction-value estimates from an out-of-date policy with an online search using\nan up-to-date model of the environment. We prove theoretical results showing\nconditions under which PA-MCTS selects the one-step optimal action and also\nbound the error accrued while following PA-MCTS as a policy. We compare and\ncontrast our approach with AlphaZero, another hybrid planning approach, and\nDeep Q Learning on several OpenAI Gym environments. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that under non-stationary settings with limited time\nconstraints, PA-MCTS outperforms these baselines.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a crucial technique in 3D computer vision with a\nwide range of applications. However, this task can be challenging, particularly\nin large fields of view with dynamic objects, environmental noise, or other\nperturbations. To address this challenge, we propose a model called PosDiffNet.\nOur approach performs hierarchical registration based on window-level,\npatch-level, and point-level correspondence. We leverage a graph neural partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) based on Beltrami flow to obtain high-dimensional\nfeatures and position embeddings for point clouds. We incorporate position\nembeddings into a Transformer module based on a neural ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) to efficiently represent patches within points. We employ the\nmulti-level correspondence derived from the high feature similarity scores to\nfacilitate alignment between point clouds. Subsequently, we use registration\nmethods such as SVD-based algorithms to predict the transformation using\ncorresponding point pairs. We evaluate PosDiffNet on several 3D point cloud\ndatasets, verifying that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for\npoint cloud registration in large fields of view with perturbations.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in autonomous vehicles (AVs), the development of\ndriving policies that ensure both the safety of AVs and traffic flow efficiency\nhas not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced\nhuman-in-the-loop reinforcement learning method, termed the Human as AI\nmentor-based deep reinforcement learning (HAIM-DRL) framework, which\nfacilitates safe and efficient autonomous driving in mixed traffic platoon.\nDrawing inspiration from the human learning process, we first introduce an\ninnovative learning paradigm that effectively injects human intelligence into\nAI, termed Human as AI mentor (HAIM). In this paradigm, the human expert serves\nas a mentor to the AI agent. While allowing the agent to sufficiently explore\nuncertain environments, the human expert can take control in dangerous\nsituations and demonstrate correct actions to avoid potential accidents. On the\nother hand, the agent could be guided to minimize traffic flow disturbance,\nthereby optimizing traffic flow efficiency. In detail, HAIM-DRL leverages data\ncollected from free exploration and partial human demonstrations as its two\ntraining sources. Remarkably, we circumvent the intricate process of manually\ndesigning reward functions; instead, we directly derive proxy state-action\nvalues from partial human demonstrations to guide the agents' policy learning.\nAdditionally, we employ a minimal intervention technique to reduce the human\nmentor's cognitive load. Comparative results show that HAIM-DRL outperforms\ntraditional methods in driving safety, sampling efficiency, mitigation of\ntraffic flow disturbance, and generalizability to unseen traffic scenarios.

Although Graph Convolutional Networks enhance performance by\nintegrating external knowledge bases, these methods are limited by the quality\nand extent of the knowledge applied. Recently, the emergence of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly improved the\nperformance of complex reasoning tasks. However, some studies have highlighted\nthe limitations of their application in fundamental NLP tasks. Consequently,\nthis study first employs CoT to investigate and enhance the capabilities of\nLLMs in STC tasks. We propose the Syntactic and Semantic Enrichment CoT\n(SSE-CoT) method, effectively decomposing the STC tasks into four distinct\nsteps: (i) essential concept identification, (ii) common-sense knowledge\nretrieval, (iii) text rewriting, and (iv) classification. Furthermore,\nrecognizing resource constraints in sectors like finance and healthcare, we\nthen introduce the CoT-Driven Multi-Task Learning (CDMT) framework to extend\nthese capabilities to smaller models. This framework begins by extracting\nrationales from LLMs and subsequently fine-tunes smaller models to optimize\ntheir performance. Extensive experimentation across six short-text benchmarks\nvalidated the efficacy of the proposed methods. In particular, SSE-CoT achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance with substantial improvements on all datasets,\nparticularly on the Ohsumed and TagMyNews datasets.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent multi-target tracking has a wide range of applications, including\nwildlife patrolling, security surveillance or environment monitoring. Such\nalgorithms often make restrictive assumptions: the number of targets and/or\ntheir initial locations may be assumed known, or agents may be pre-assigned to\nmonitor disjoint partitions of the environment, reducing the burden of\nexploration. This also limits applicability when there are fewer agents than\ntargets, since agents are unable to continuously follow the targets in their\nfields of view. Multi-agent tracking algorithms additionally assume inter-agent\nsynchronization of observations, or the presence of a central controller to\ncoordinate joint actions. Instead, we focus on the setting of decentralized\nmulti-agent, multi-target, simultaneous active search-and-tracking with\nasynchronous inter-agent communication. Our proposed algorithm DecSTER uses a\nsequential monte carlo implementation of the probability hypothesis density\nfilter for posterior inference combined with Thompson sampling for\ndecentralized multi-agent decision making. We compare different action\nselection policies, focusing on scenarios where targets outnumber agents. In\nsimulation, we demonstrate that DecSTER is robust to unreliable inter-agent\ncommunication and outperforms information-greedy baselines in terms of the\nOptimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) metric for different numbers of targets\nand varying teamsizes.",

With\nopen-source documentation, assembling manuals and affordable materials,\nstudents from different socio-economic backgrounds can personalize their\nlearning experience based on their individual educational goals. To evaluate\nthe student-perceived quality of our module, we conducted a usability testing\nworkshop with 15 college students recruited from a minority-serving\ninstitution.

    "abstract": "Many real-world systems exhibit temporal, dynamic behaviors, which are\ncaptured as time series of complex agent interactions. To perform temporal\nreasoning, current methods primarily encode temporal dynamics through simple\nsequence-based models. However, in general these models fail to efficiently\ncapture the full spectrum of rich dynamics in the input, since the dynamics is\nnot uniformly distributed. In particular, relevant information might be harder\nto extract and computing power is wasted for processing all individual\ntimesteps, even if they contain no significant changes or no new information.\nHere we propose TimeGraphs, a novel approach that characterizes dynamic\ninteractions as a hierarchical temporal graph, diverging from traditional\nsequential representations. Our approach models the interactions using a\ncompact graph-based representation, enabling adaptive reasoning across diverse\ntime scales. Adopting a self-supervised method, TimeGraphs constructs a\nmulti-level event hierarchy from a temporal input, which is then used to\nefficiently reason about the unevenly distributed dynamics. This construction\nprocess is scalable and incremental to accommodate streaming data. We evaluate\nTimeGraphs on multiple datasets with complex, dynamic agent interactions,\nincluding a football simulator, the Resistance game, and the MOMA human\nactivity dataset. The results demonstrate both robustness and efficiency of\nTimeGraphs on a range of temporal reasoning tasks. Our approach obtains\nstate-of-the-art performance and leads to a performance increase of up to 12.2%\non event prediction and recognition tasks over current approaches. Our\nexperiments further demonstrate a wide array of capabilities including\nzero-shot generalization, robustness in case of data sparsity, and adaptability\nto streaming data flow.",

Empirical results demonstrate\nthe superiority of CogGPT over existing methods, particularly in its ability to\nfacilitate role-specific cognitive dynamics under continuous information flows.",

    "abstract": "As deep neural networks and the datasets used to train them get larger, the\ndefault approach to integrating them into research and commercial projects is\nto download a pre-trained model and fine tune it. But these models can have\nuncertain provenance, opening up the possibility that they embed hidden\nmalicious behavior such as trojans or backdoors, where small changes to an\ninput (triggers) can cause the model to produce incorrect outputs (e.g., to\nmisclassify). This paper introduces a novel approach to backdoor detection that\nuses two tensor decomposition methods applied to network activations. This has\na number of advantages relative to existing detection methods, including the\nability to analyze multiple models at the same time, working across a wide\nvariety of network architectures, making no assumptions about the nature of\ntriggers used to alter network behavior, and being computationally efficient.\nWe provide a detailed description of the detection pipeline along with results\non models trained on the MNIST digit dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, and two\ndifficult datasets from NIST's TrojAI competition. These results show that our\nmethod detects backdoored networks more accurately and efficiently than current\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of patent document analysis, assessing semantic similarity\nbetween phrases presents a significant challenge, notably amplifying the\ninherent complexities of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) research.\nFirstly, this study addresses these challenges, recognizing early CPC work\nwhile acknowledging past struggles with language barriers and document\nintricacy. Secondly, it underscores the persisting difficulties of CPC\nresearch.\n  To overcome these challenges and bolster the CPC system, This paper presents\ntwo key innovations. Firstly, it introduces an ensemble approach that\nincorporates four BERT-related models, enhancing semantic similarity accuracy\nthrough weighted averaging. Secondly, a novel text preprocessing method\ntailored for patent documents is introduced, featuring a distinctive input\nstructure with token scoring that aids in capturing semantic relationships\nduring CPC context training, utilizing BCELoss. Our experimental findings\nconclusively establish the effectiveness of both our Ensemble Model and novel\ntext processing strategies when deployed on the U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase\nMatching dataset.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning frameworks in unlabeled time series have been\nproposed for medical signal processing. Despite the numerous excellent\nprogresses have been made in previous works, we observe the representation\nextracted for the time series still does not generalize well. In this paper, we\npresent a Time series (medical signal) Representation Learning framework via\nSpectrogram (TRLS) to get more informative representations. We transform the\ninput time-domain medical signals into spectrograms and design a time-frequency\nencoder named Time Frequency RNN (TFRNN) to capture more robust multi-scale\nrepresentations from the augmented spectrograms. Our TRLS takes spectrogram as\ninput with two types of different data augmentations and maximizes the\nsimilarity between positive ones, which effectively circumvents the problem of\ndesigning negative samples. Our evaluation of four real-world medical signal\ndatasets focusing on medical signal classification shows that TRLS is superior\nto the existing frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods such as LoRA, Adapter, and Visual\nPrompt Tuning (VPT) have found success in enabling adaptation to new domains by\ntuning small modules within a transformer model. However, the number of domains\nencountered during test time can be very large, and the data is usually\nunlabeled. Thus, adaptation to new domains is challenging; it is also\nimpractical to generate customized tuned modules for each such domain. Toward\naddressing these challenges, this work introduces PLUTO: a Plug-and-pLay\nmodUlar Test-time domain adaptatiOn strategy. We pre-train a large set of\nmodules, each specialized for different source domains, effectively creating a\n``module store''. Given a target domain with few-shot unlabeled data, we\nintroduce an unsupervised test-time adaptation (TTA) method to (1) select a\nsparse subset of relevant modules from this store and (2) create a weighted\ncombination of selected modules without tuning their weights. This\nplug-and-play nature enables us to harness multiple most-relevant source\ndomains in a single inference call. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that\nPLUTO uniformly outperforms alternative TTA methods and that selecting $\\leq$5\nmodules suffice to extract most of the benefit. At a high level, our method\nequips pre-trained transformers with the capability to dynamically adapt to new\ndomains, motivating a new paradigm for efficient and scalable domain\nadaptation.",

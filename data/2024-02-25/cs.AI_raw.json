To address this, we introduce a one-stage PCL framework by\ndirectly using the intermediate layer's token embedding as a prompt query. This\ndesign removes the need for an additional feed-forward stage for query ViT,\nresulting in ~50% computational cost reduction for both training and inference\nwith marginal accuracy drop < 1%. We further introduce a Query-Pool\nRegularization (QR) loss that regulates the relationship between the prompt\nquery and the prompt pool to improve representation power. The QR loss is only\napplied during training time, so there is no computational overhead at\ninference from the QR loss. With the QR loss, our approach maintains ~ 50%\ncomputational cost reduction during inference as well as outperforms the prior\ntwo-stage PCL methods by ~1.4% on public class-incremental continual learning\nbenchmarks including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the de facto standard practice for\nsequential decision-making problems by improving future acting policies with\nfeedback. However, RL algorithms may require extensive trial-and-error\ninteractions to collect useful feedback for improvement. On the other hand,\nrecent developments in large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive\ncapabilities in language understanding and generation, yet they fall short in\nexploration and self-improvement capabilities for planning tasks, lacking the\nability to autonomously refine their responses based on feedback. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we study how the policy prior provided by the LLM can enhance the\nsample efficiency of RL algorithms. Specifically, we develop an algorithm named\nLINVIT that incorporates LLM guidance as a regularization factor in value-based\nRL, leading to significant reductions in the amount of data needed for\nlearning, particularly when the difference between the ideal policy and the\nLLM-informed policy is small, which suggests that the initial policy is close\nto optimal, reducing the need for further exploration. Additionally, we present\na practical algorithm SLINVIT that simplifies the construction of the value\nfunction and employs subgoals to reduce the search complexity. Our experiments\nacross three interactive environments ALFWorld, InterCode, and BlocksWorld\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art success rates and also\nsurpasses previous RL and LLM approaches in terms of sample efficiency.

Previous works attempt to automate this process using the\nNext-Best-View (NBV) policy for active 3D reconstruction. However, the existing\nNBV policies heavily rely on hand-crafted criteria, limited action space, or\nper-scene optimized representations. These constraints limit their\ncross-dataset generalizability. To overcome them, we propose GenNBV, an\nend-to-end generalizable NBV policy. Our policy adopts a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based framework and extends typical limited action space to 5D free space.\nIt empowers our agent drone to scan from any viewpoint, and even interact with\nunseen geometries during training. To boost the cross-dataset generalizability,\nwe also propose a novel multi-source state embedding, including geometric,\nsemantic, and action representations. We establish a benchmark using the Isaac\nGym simulator with the Houses3K and OmniObject3D datasets to evaluate this NBV\npolicy.

Traditionally, internet protocol (IP) and media access control\n(MAC) addresses are utilized for identifying network-connected devices in a\nnetwork, whilst these addressing schemes are prone to be compromised, including\nspoofing attacks and MAC randomization.

    "abstract": "Live performances of music are always charming, with the unpredictability of\nimprovisation due to the dynamic between musicians and interactions with the\naudience. Jazz improvisation is a particularly noteworthy example for further\ninvestigation from a theoretical perspective. Here, we introduce a novel\nmathematical game theory model for jazz improvisation, providing a framework\nfor studying music theory and improvisational methodologies. We use\ncomputational modeling, mainly reinforcement learning, to explore diverse\nstochastic improvisational strategies and their paired performance on\nimprovisation. We find that the most effective strategy pair is a strategy that\nreacts to the most recent payoff (Stepwise Changes) with a reinforcement\nlearning strategy limited to notes in the given chord (Chord-Following\nReinforcement Learning). Conversely, a strategy that reacts to the partner's\nlast note and attempts to harmonize with it (Harmony Prediction) strategy pair\nyields the lowest non-control payoff and highest standard deviation, indicating\nthat picking notes based on immediate reactions to the partner player can yield\ninconsistent outcomes. On average, the Chord-Following Reinforcement Learning\nstrategy demonstrates the highest mean payoff, while Harmony Prediction\nexhibits the lowest. Our work lays the foundation for promising applications\nbeyond jazz: including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models to\nextract data from audio clips to refine musical reward systems, and training\nmachine learning (ML) models on existing jazz solos to further refine\nstrategies within the game.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)\ntools like ChatGPT on the creation and consumption of terminological\ndefinitions. From the terminologist's point of view, the strategic use of GenAI\ntools can streamline the process of crafting definitions, reducing both time\nand effort, while potentially enhancing quality. GenAI tools enable AI-assisted\nterminography, notably post-editing terminography, where the machine produces a\ndefinition that the terminologist then corrects or refines. However, the\npotential of GenAI tools to fulfill all the terminological needs of a user,\nincluding term definitions, challenges the very existence of terminological\ndefinitions and resources as we know them. Unlike terminological definitions,\nGenAI tools can describe the knowledge activated by a term in a specific\ncontext. However, a main drawback of these tools is that their output can\ncontain errors. For this reason, users requiring reliability will likely still\nresort to terminological resources for definitions. Nevertheless, with the\ninevitable integration of AI into terminology work, the distinction between\nhuman-created and AI-created content will become increasingly blurred.",

    "abstract": "Model reparameterization is a widely accepted technique for improving\ninference speed without compromising performance. However, current\nPost-training Quantization (PTQ) methods often lead to significant accuracy\ndegradation when applied to reparameterized models. This is primarily caused by\nchannel-specific and sample-specific outliers, which appear only at specific\nsamples and channels and impact on the selection of quantization parameters. To\naddress this issue, we propose RepAPQ, a novel framework that preserves the\naccuracy of quantized reparameterization models. Different from previous\nframeworks using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a measurement, we utilize Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) to mitigate the influence of outliers on quantization\nparameters. Our framework comprises two main components: Quantization\nProtecting Reparameterization and Across-block Calibration. For effective\ncalibration, Quantization Protecting Reparameterization combines multiple\nbranches into a single convolution with an affine layer. During training, the\naffine layer accelerates convergence and amplifies the output of the\nconvolution to better accommodate samples with outliers. Additionally,\nAcross-block Calibration leverages the measurement of stage output as\nsupervision to address the gradient problem introduced by MAE and enhance the\ninterlayer correlation with quantization parameters. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RepAPQ across various models and tasks. Our\nframework outperforms previous methods by approximately 1\\% for 8-bit PTQ and\n2\\% for 6-bit PTQ, showcasing its superior performance.

    "abstract": "In disaster scenarios and high-stakes rescue operations, integrating Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs) as fog nodes has become crucial. This integration\nensures a smooth connection between affected populations and essential health\nmonitoring devices, supported by the Internet of Things (IoT). Integrating UAVs\nin such environments is inherently challenging, where the primary objectives\ninvolve maximizing network connectivity and coverage while extending the\nnetwork's lifetime through energy-efficient strategies to serve the maximum\nnumber of affected individuals. In this paper, We propose a novel model centred\naround dynamic UAV-based fog deployment that optimizes the system's\nadaptability and operational efficacy within the afflicted areas. First, we\ndecomposed the problem into two subproblems. Connectivity and coverage\nsubproblem, and network lifespan optimization subproblem. We shape our UAV fog\ndeployment problem as a uni-objective optimization and introduce a specialized\nUAV fog deployment algorithm tailored specifically for UAV fog nodes deployed\nin rescue missions. While the network lifespan optimization subproblem is\nefficiently solved via a one-dimensional swapping method. Following that, We\nintroduce a novel optimization strategy for UAV fog node placement in dynamic\nnetworks during evacuation scenarios, with a primary focus on ensuring robust\nconnectivity and maximal coverage for mobile users, while extending the\nnetwork's lifespan. Finally, we introduce Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm\n(WOA) for fog node deployment in a dynamic network. Its agility, rapid\nconvergence, and low computational demands make it an ideal fit for\nhigh-pressure environments.",

To handle the general clustering scenario\nwithout a prior graph, these models estimate an initial graph beforehand to\napply GCN. Throughout the literature, we have witnessed that 1) most models\nfocus on the initial graph while neglecting the original features. Therefore,\nthe discriminability of the learned representation may be corrupted by a\nlow-quality initial graph; 2) the training procedure lacks effective clustering\nguidance, which may lead to the incorporation of clustering-irrelevant\ninformation into the learned graph. To tackle these problems, the Deep\nContrastive Graph Learning (DCGL) model is proposed for general data\nclustering. Specifically, we establish a pseudo-siamese network, which\nincorporates auto-encoder with GCN to emphasize both the graph structure and\nthe original features. On this basis, feature-level contrastive learning is\nintroduced to enhance the discriminative capacity, and the relationship between\nsamples and centroids is employed as the clustering-oriented guidance.\nAfterward, a two-branch graph learning mechanism is designed to extract the\nlocal and global structural relationships, which are further embedded into a\nunified graph under the cluster-level contrastive guidance.

However, the likelihood, a measure of\nLLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in\nsentences, such as word order and sentence structure. It is therefore possible\nthat there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they\nmight overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with\nlower likelihoods. In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of\nlikelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators. We also propose a method to mitigate\nthe likelihood bias. Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot\nexamples for in-context learning.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative optimization of machine\nlearning models across decentralized data by aggregating model parameters. Our\napproach extends this concept by aggregating \"knowledge\" derived from models,\ninstead of model parameters. We present a novel framework called CoDream, where\nclients collaboratively optimize randomly initialized data using federated\noptimization in the input data space, similar to how randomly initialized model\nparameters are optimized in FL. Our key insight is that jointly optimizing this\ndata can effectively capture the properties of the global data distribution.\nSharing knowledge in data space offers numerous benefits: (1) model-agnostic\ncollaborative learning, i.e., different clients can have different model\narchitectures; (2) communication that is independent of the model size,\neliminating scalability concerns with model parameters; (3) compatibility with\nsecure aggregation, thus preserving the privacy benefits of federated learning;\n(4) allowing of adaptive optimization of knowledge shared for personalized\nlearning. We empirically validate CoDream on standard FL tasks, demonstrating\ncompetitive performance despite not sharing model parameters. Our code:\nhttps://mitmedialab.github.io/codream.github.io/",

This paper\nproposes a novel method for budget-constrained tool learning. Our approach\ninvolves creating a preferable plan under the budget constraint before\nutilizing the tools. This plan outlines the feasible tools and the maximum\nnumber of times they can be employed, offering a comprehensive overview of the\ntool learning process for large language models. This allows them to allocate\nthe budget from a broader perspective. To devise the plan without incurring\nsignificant extra costs, we suggest initially estimating the usefulness of the\ncandidate tools based on past experience. Subsequently, we employ dynamic\nprogramming to formulate the plan. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod can be integrated with various tool learning methods, significantly\nenhancing their effectiveness under strict budget constraints.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential as tools to support\nan expanding range of decision-making tasks. Given their training on human\n(created) data, LLMs have been shown to inherit societal biases against\nprotected groups, as well as be subject to bias functionally resembling\ncognitive bias. Human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made\nwith LLM assistance. Our work introduces BiasBuster, a framework designed to\nuncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in\nhigh-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and\ncognitive science, we develop a dataset containing 13,465 prompts to evaluate\nLLM decisions on different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential,\ninherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, while proposing a novel\nmethod utilizing LLMs to debias their own human-like cognitive bias within\nprompts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture of the presence and\neffects of cognitive bias across commercial and open-source models. We\ndemonstrate that our selfhelp debiasing effectively mitigates model answers\nthat display patterns akin to human cognitive bias without having to manually\ncraft examples for each bias.",

    "abstract": "As research and deployment of AI grows, the computational burden to support\nand sustain its progress inevitably does too. To train or fine-tune\nstate-of-the-art models in NLP, computer vision, etc., some form of AI hardware\nacceleration is virtually a requirement. Recent large language models require\nconsiderable resources to train and deploy, resulting in significant energy\nusage, potential carbon emissions, and massive demand for GPUs and other\nhardware accelerators. However, this surge carries large implications for\nenergy sustainability at the HPC/datacenter level. In this paper, we study the\naggregate effect of power-capping GPUs on GPU temperature and power draw at a\nresearch supercomputing center. With the right amount of power-capping, we show\nsignificant decreases in both temperature and power draw, reducing power\nconsumption and potentially improving hardware life-span with minimal impact on\njob performance. While power-capping reduces power draw by design, the\naggregate system-wide effect on overall energy consumption is less clear; for\ninstance, if users notice job performance degradation from GPU power-caps, they\nmay request additional GPU-jobs to compensate, negating any energy savings or\neven worsening energy consumption. To our knowledge, our work is the first to\nconduct and make available a detailed analysis of the effects of GPU\npower-capping at the supercomputing scale. We hope our work will inspire\nHPCs/datacenters to further explore, evaluate, and communicate the impact of\npower-capping AI hardware accelerators for more sustainable AI.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an innovative Attention-GAN framework for enhancing\ncybersecurity, focusing on anomaly detection. In response to the challenges\nposed by the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, the proposed approach\naims to generate diverse and realistic synthetic attack scenarios, thereby\nenriching the dataset and improving threat identification. Integrating\nattention mechanisms with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a key\nfeature of the proposed method. The attention mechanism enhances the model's\nability to focus on relevant features, essential for detecting subtle and\ncomplex attack patterns. In addition, GANs address the issue of data scarcity\nby generating additional varied attack data, encompassing known and emerging\nthreats. This dual approach ensures that the system remains relevant and\neffective against the continuously evolving cyberattacks. The KDD Cup and\nCICIDS2017 datasets were used to validate this model, which exhibited\nsignificant improvements in anomaly detection. It achieved an accuracy of\n99.69% on the KDD dataset and 97.93% on the CICIDS2017 dataset, with precision,\nrecall, and F1-scores above 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing\ncomplex attack patterns. This study contributes significantly to cybersecurity\nby providing a scalable and adaptable solution for anomaly detection in the\nface of sophisticated and dynamic cyber threats. The exploration of GANs for\ndata augmentation highlights a promising direction for future research,\nparticularly in situations where data limitations restrict the development of\ncybersecurity systems. The attention-GAN framework has emerged as a pioneering\napproach, setting a new benchmark for advanced cyber-defense strategies.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are leading significant progress in code\ngeneration. Beyond one-pass code generation, recent works further integrate\nunit tests and program verifiers into LLMs to iteratively refine the generated\nprograms. However, these works consider the generated programs as an\nindivisible entity, which falls short for LLMs in debugging the programs,\nespecially when the programs contain complex logic flows and data operations.\nIn contrast, when human developers debug programs, they typically set\nbreakpoints and selectively examine runtime execution information. The\nexecution flow and the intermediate variables play a crucial role in the\ndebugging process, yet they are underutilized in the existing literature on\ncode generation. In this study, we introduce Large Language Model Debugger\n(LDB), a novel debugging framework that enables LLMs to refine their generated\nprograms with the runtime execution information. Specifically, LDB segments the\nprograms into basic blocks and tracks the values of intermediate variables\nafter each block throughout the runtime execution. This allows LLMs to\nconcentrate on simpler code units within the overall execution flow, verify\ntheir correctness against the task description block by block, and efficiently\npinpoint any potential errors. Experiments demonstrate that LDB consistently\nenhances the baseline performance by up to 9.8% across the HumanEval, MBPP, and\nTransCoder benchmarks, archiving new state-of-the-art performance in code\ndebugging for various LLM selections.",

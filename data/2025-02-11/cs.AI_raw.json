    "abstract": "Holdout validation and hyperparameter tuning from data is a long-standing\nproblem in offline reinforcement learning (RL). A standard framework is to use\noff-policy evaluation (OPE) methods to evaluate and select the policies, but\nOPE either incurs exponential variance (e.g., importance sampling) or has\nhyperparameters on their own (e.g., FQE and model-based). In this work we focus\non hyperparameter tuning for OPE itself, which is even more under-investigated.\nConcretely, we select among candidate value functions (\"model-free\") or\ndynamics (\"model-based\") to best assess the performance of a target policy. We\ndevelop: (1) new model-free and model-based selectors with theoretical\nguarantees, and (2) a new experimental protocol for empirically evaluating\nthem. Compared to the model-free protocol in prior works, our new protocol\nallows for more stable generation and better control of candidate value\nfunctions in an optimization-free manner, and evaluation of model-free and\nmodel-based methods alike. We exemplify the protocol on Gym-Hopper, and find\nthat our new model-free selector, LSTD-Tournament, demonstrates promising\nempirical performance.",

In this paper, we take a radically different approach,\ndirectly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g.,\nunsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid\nspecific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune\nDMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples\nthat are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\\textit{safe}$\ndenoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated.\nInspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully\nproduces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data\ndistribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image\ngeneration scenarios.

In\nthis work, we show that these two seemingly separate families can actually be\nunified by looking at posterior guidance as a greedy strategy of end-to-end\nguidance. We explore the theoretical connections between these two families and\nprovide an in-depth theoretical of these two techniques relative to the\ncontinuous ideal gradients. Motivated by this analysis we then show a method\nfor interpolating between these two families enabling a trade-off between\ncompute and accuracy of the guidance gradients.

Current mainstream approaches rely on text node\nfeatures and obtain initial node embeddings through shallow embedding learning\nusing GNNs, which shows limitations in capturing deep textual semantics. Recent\nadvances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior\ncapabilities in understanding text semantics, transforming traditional text\nfeature processing. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines Graph\nTransformer architecture with LLM-enhanced node features. Specifically, we\nleverage LLMs to generate rich semantic representations of text nodes, which\nare then processed by a multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Graph\nTransformer to capture both local and global graph structural information. Our\nmodel utilizes the Transformer's attention mechanism to dynamically aggregate\nneighborhood information while preserving the semantic richness provided by LLM\nembeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-enhanced node\nfeatures significantly improve the performance of graph learning models on node\nclassification tasks. This approach shows promising results across multiple\ngraph learning tasks, offering a practical direction for combining graph\nnetworks with language models.",

Compared to i.i.d. data like images, the OOD generalization\nproblem on graph-structured data remains challenging due to the non-i.i.d.\nproperty and complex structural information on graphs. Recently, several works\non graph OOD generalization have explored extracting invariant subgraphs that\nshare crucial classification information across different distributions.\nNevertheless, such a strategy could be suboptimal for entirely capturing the\ninvariant information, as the extraction of discrete structures could\npotentially lead to the loss of invariant information or the involvement of\nspurious information.

To address the\nchallenge of optimization in the absence of optimal invariant subgraphs (i.e.,\nground truths), we derive a tractable form of the proposed GRM objective by\nintroducing a latent causal variable, and its effectiveness is validated by our\ntheoretical analysis.

In this work, we present\nthe largest comprehensive analysis to-date of how the upstream pre-training\nfactors and downstream performance of CLIP models relate to their intrinsic\nbiases. Studying 131 unique CLIP models, trained on 26 datasets, using 55\narchitectures, and in a variety of sizes, we evaluate bias in each model using\n26 well-established unimodal and cross-modal principled Embedding Association\nTests. We find that the choice of pre-training dataset is the most significant\nupstream predictor of bias, whereas architectural variations have minimal\nimpact. Additionally, datasets curated using sophisticated filtering techniques\naimed at enhancing downstream model performance tend to be associated with\nhigher levels of intrinsic bias. Finally, we observe that intrinsic bias is\noften significantly correlated with downstream performance ($0.3 \\leq r \\leq\n0.8$), suggesting that models optimized for performance inadvertently learn to\namplify representational biases.

However, these methods often struggle\nwith learning inefficiencies when applied to complex, real-world\ndecision-making tasks with sparse rewards and long-horizon dependencies. We\npropose a novel framework, Variational Subgoal-Conditioned Reinforcement\nLearning (VSC-RL), advancing the VLM agents in resolving challenging\ndecision-making tasks. Fundamentally distinct from existing methods, VSC-RL\nreformulates the decision-making problem as a variational subgoal-conditioned\nRL problem with the newly derived optimization objective, Subgoal Evidence\nLower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which comprises two key components: (a) maximizing the\nsubgoal-conditioned return, and (b) minimizing the divergence from a reference\ngoal-conditioned policy. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the\nVSC-RL can efficiently improve the learning efficiency without compromising\nperformance guarantees. Across a diverse set of challenging benchmarks,\nincluding mobile device and web control tasks, VSC-RL consistently outperforms\nexisting SOTA methods, achieving superior learning efficiency and performance.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies begin to permeate diverse\nfields-from healthcare to education-consumers, researchers and policymakers are\nincreasingly raising concerns about whether and how AI is regulated. It is\ntherefore reasonable to anticipate that alignment with principles of 'ethical'\nor 'responsible' AI, as well as compliance with law and policy, will form an\nincreasingly important part of AI development. Yet, for the most part, the\nconventional computer science curriculum is ill-equipped to prepare students\nfor these challenges. To this end, we seek to explore how new educational\ncontent related to AI ethics and AI policy can be integrated into both ethics-\nand technical-focused courses. This paper describes a two-lecture 'AI policy\nmodule' that was piloted in a graduate-level introductory machine learning\ncourse in 2024. The module, which includes an in-class active learning game, is\nevaluated using data from student surveys before and after the lectures, and\npedagogical motivations and considerations are discussed.

In the classical setting, the seller withholds disclosure to avoid\nmisappropriation, leading to inefficiency. We show that trusted execution\nenvironments (TEEs) combined with AI agents can mitigate and even fully\neliminate this hold-up problem.

    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks\non current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head\nLatent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the\nkey-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be\ncached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to\ntraditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA\nemploys an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional\ncomputation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated\nefficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers\nstill rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to\nadopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA\nwhile maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold.\nTo encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method\nthat converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen,\nMixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo\nadditional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache\nsize.

    "abstract": "Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR)\nvideo generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies\nand slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive\n(semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation.\nBy uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or\nframes), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks,\nallowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the\ncorresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our\nframework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to\ncapture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in\nparallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps,\nleading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores\nof 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an\naverage of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps,\nthe NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving\nan 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B\nparameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD\nscores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600,\ndemonstrating the scalability of our approach.",

While\nmeta-learning strategies have emerged as a promising approach for addressing\nthis challenge, existing methods often suffer from limited transferability and\ntask-specific designs. This paper introduces TMLC-Net, a novel Transferable\nMeta-Learner for Correcting Noisy Labels, designed to overcome these\nlimitations. TMLC-Net learns a general-purpose label correction strategy that\ncan be readily applied across diverse datasets and model architectures without\nrequiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Our approach integrates three\ncore components: (1) Normalized Noise Perception, which captures and normalizes\ntraining dynamics to handle distribution shifts; (2) Time-Series Encoding,\nwhich models the temporal evolution of sample statistics using a recurrent\nneural network; and (3) Subclass Decoding, which predicts a corrected label\ndistribution based on the learned representations. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets with various noise types and levels,\ndemonstrating that TMLC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of both accuracy and robustness to label noise. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the transferability of TMLC-Net, showcasing its adaptability to new\ndatasets and noise conditions, and establishing its potential as a broadly\napplicable solution for robust deep learning in noisy environments.",

Challenging this, we propose a new principle:\nPreference data vary in difficulty, and overly difficult examples hinder\nalignment, by exceeding the model's capacity. Through systematic\nexperimentation, we validate this principle with three key findings: (1)\npreference examples vary in difficulty, as evidenced by consistent learning\norders across alignment runs; (2) overly difficult examples significantly\ndegrade performance across four LLMs and two datasets; and (3) the capacity of\na model dictates its threshold for handling difficult examples, underscoring a\ncritical relationship between data selection and model capacity.

This paper introduces\nSymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to\nautomatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop\nSymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used\nERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural\nlanguage descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first\ninstructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then\nsynthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where\nviolations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation\nshows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world\ncontracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing\nfinancial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT\noutperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service,\nunderscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source language model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art (as of April 5 2025) performance in automated formal proof\ngeneration for mathematical problems. A key challenge in this field is the\nscarcity of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, which we address\nthrough the following approaches. First, we train LLMs to convert natural\nlanguage math problems from the Numina dataset to equivalent formal statements\nin Lean 4. This process creates the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1, which includes 1.64\nmillion formal statements. Next, we develop a large dataset of formal proofs by\ntraining a series of provers. Each new prover can prove many statements that\nprevious ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for\nthe next prover. Finally, we obtain the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1-solved, which\ncontains proofs for over 800K statements from Goedel-Pset-v1. Supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base on Goedel-Pset-v1-solved (i.e.,\nno RL) yields a Goedel-Prover-SFT that achieves a success rate of 57.6%\n(Pass@32) on miniF2F, surpassing the previous leader DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL\n(trained using SFT + RL on a proprietary dataset) by 7.6%. On PutnamBench,\nGoedel-Prover-SFT successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on\nthe leaderboard. We provide extensive discussion of our training methodology,\nhighlighting the key design choices that contribute to Goedel-Prover's strong\nperformance. Further RL training (including DPO) improves Goedel-Prover-SFT's\nsuccess rate to over 60% (Pass@32) on miniF2F.\n  To aid future research, we provide extensive discussion of our training\nmethodology and design choices. We also fully open-source our codes, models,\nand datasets. Additionally, we open-source formal proofs for 29.7K problems in\nLean Workbook, nearly doubling the 15.7K solved by prior provers.",

    "abstract": "In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical\nsignificance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable\ngeneration primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models,\nwhile Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image\nconditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast\nsamplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion\nrequires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain\nhigh-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR\nSampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time\nSDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated\nwith MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist\nof an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network.\nBased on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps.\nOur approach does not require training and supports all mainstream\nparameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity\nprediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high\nsampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image\nrestoration tasks.

Instead, we should strive to develop\nneologisms: new words that represent precise human concepts that we want to\nteach machines, or machine concepts that we need to learn. We start from the\npremise that humans and machines have differing concepts. This means\ninterpretability can be framed as a communication problem: humans must be able\nto reference and control machine concepts, and communicate human concepts to\nmachines. Creating a shared human-machine language through developing\nneologisms, we believe, could solve this communication problem. Successful\nneologisms achieve a useful amount of abstraction: not too detailed, so they're\nreusable in many contexts, and not too high-level, so they convey precise\ninformation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how a \"length neologism\"\nenables controlling LLM response length, while a \"diversity neologism\" allows\nsampling more variable responses. Taken together, we argue that we cannot\nunderstand AI using our existing vocabulary, and expanding it through\nneologisms creates opportunities for both controlling and understanding\nmachines better.",

In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both\ncommunication and computation parallelism when training linear attention\ntransformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work\nLASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear\nattention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of\nLASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed\non intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence\nlength, leading to significant improvements of both communication and\ncomputation parallelism, as well as their overlap. Additionally, we extend\nLASP-2 to LASP-2H by applying similar communication redesign to standard\nattention modules, offering an efficient SP solution for hybrid models that\nblend linear and standard attention layers. Our evaluation on a Linear-Llama3\nmodel, a variant of Llama3 with linear attention replacing standard attention,\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of LASP-2 and LASP-2H.

Despite\nsignificant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the\nhigh-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations\namong multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence\npatterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest\n(POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on\ndifferent trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by\ndisparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory\nUser Linking model (HGTUL).

    "abstract": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large\nfraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data\nthat requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals.\nAutomated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify\ntransit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and\nvalidation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for\nthe search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we\npropose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for\nphase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those\nobserved in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new\nneural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image\n(FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally\ndeveloped for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated\nsignificant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous\napproaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ\nmulti-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from\nthe complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series,\nwithout requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn\ncharacteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps\ndistinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model\nsuccessfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122\nmulti-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from\nTESS sectors 1-26 with a radius > 0.27 $R_{\\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating\nits ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven machine learning models often require extensive datasets, which\ncan be costly or inaccessible, and their predictions may fail to comply with\nestablished physical laws. Current approaches for incorporating physical priors\nmitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in\nphysics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that\nautomatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do\nnot guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and\ninvariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality. We propose a novel\nphysics-consistent machine learning method that directly enforces compliance\nwith physical principles by projecting model outputs onto the manifold defined\nby these laws. This procedure ensures that predictions inherently adhere to the\nchosen physical constraints, improving reliability and interpretability. Our\nmethod is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a\nlow-temperature reactive plasma. Compared to purely data-driven models, our\napproach significantly reduces errors in physical law compliance, enhances\npredictive accuracy of physical quantities, and outperforms alternatives when\nworking with simpler models or limited datasets. The proposed projection-based\ntechnique is versatile and can function independently or in conjunction with\nexisting physics-informed neural networks, offering a powerful, general, and\nscalable solution for developing fast and reliable surrogate models of complex\nphysical systems, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a\ncrucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to\ntraining data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy.\nSynthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in\nmedical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data\nrepository for this task. This study presents the first systematic attempt to\nidentify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to\ntraining data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1)\nprompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced\nto hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all\ntokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization.\nThis highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and\nT2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time\nmemorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently\nreduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens. On this front, we propose\nactionable strategies for different stakeholders to enhance privacy and improve\nthe reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results\nprovide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking\nmemorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using\nthe MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Unlike prior\nworks, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and\ndemonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS\nsubstantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes\nbeyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a\n+2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by\nderiving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic\nperformance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with\nlight-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and\nstochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled\npretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth\nis not applied at inference time.

A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion\npower is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade\nplasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma\nscenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental\nmachines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling\nevolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically\nis extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge,\nmaking it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies.

The prompts\ncover a wide range of topics, including complex concepts from art, popular\nculture, folk traditions, famous people's names, natural objects, scientific\nachievements, etc. We present the results of a human evaluation of the\nside-by-side comparison of Russian visual concepts representations using\npopular generative models.",

Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our\nmethod reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest\nperturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant\ndifferences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger\nperformance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more\nsensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed\nprompt patterns.

Estimating\nand respecting personal space is essential for enhancing human-computer\ninteraction (HCI) and smart environments. Personal space preferences vary due\nto individual traits, cultural background, and contextual factors. Advanced\nmultimodal sensing technologies, including eye-tracking and wristband sensors,\noffer opportunities to develop adaptive systems that dynamically adjust to user\ncomfort levels. Integrating physiological and behavioral data enables a deeper\nunderstanding of spatial interactions. This study develops a sensor-based model\nto estimate comfortable personal space and identifies key features influencing\nspatial preferences. Our findings show that multimodal sensors, particularly\neye-tracking and physiological wristband data, can effectively predict personal\nspace preferences, with eye-tracking data playing a more significant role. An\nexperimental study involving controlled human interactions demonstrates that a\nTransformer-based model achieves the highest predictive accuracy (F1 score:\n0.87) for estimating personal space. Eye-tracking features, such as gaze point\nand pupil diameter, emerge as the most significant predictors, while\nphysiological signals from wristband sensors contribute marginally. These\nresults highlight the potential for AI-driven personalization of social space\nin adaptive environments, suggesting that multimodal sensing can be leveraged\nto develop intelligent systems that optimize spatial arrangements in\nworkplaces, educational institutions, and public settings.

Thus, in our case, this approach helps us understand how different\nprocessing steps and structures at various scales impact the final properties\nof CNT fibers. The analysis targeted structures ranging from the nanoscale to\nthe macroscale, including aggregation size distributions of CNT dispersions and\nthe effective length of CNTs. Furthermore, because some types of data were\ndifficult to interpret using standard methods, challenging-to-interpret\ndistribution data were analyzed using Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for\nextracting key features that determine the outcome. Contribution analysis with\nSHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) demonstrated that small, uniformly\ndistributed aggregates are crucial for improving fracture strength, while CNTs\nwith long effective lengths are significant factors for enhancing electrical\nconductivity. The analysis also identified thresholds and trends for these key\nfactors to assist in defining the conditions needed to optimize CNT fiber\nproperties. EMML is not limited to CNT fibers but can be applied to the design\nof other materials derived from nanomaterials, making it a useful tool for\ndeveloping a wide range of advanced materials. This approach provides a\nfoundation for advancing data-driven materials research.",

However, the training techniques and data requirements to\nelicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large\nLanguage model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through\ndata-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the\nQwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of\nmath and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0%\n(+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's\nscore of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long\nCoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual\nreasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as\ntraining on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little\nimpact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt\nlogical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning\nsteps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT\nsamples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared\nto training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding\nof how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key\nconsiderations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning\nmodels.

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in\nethically sensitive domains such as education, healthcare, and transportation,\nthe need to balance accuracy and interpretability in decision-making has become\na central concern. Coarse Ethics (CE) is a theoretical framework that justifies\ncoarse-grained evaluations, such as letter grades or warning labels, as\nethically appropriate under cognitive and contextual constraints. However, CE\nhas lacked mathematical formalization. This paper introduces Coarse Set Theory\n(CST), a novel mathematical framework that models coarse-grained\ndecision-making using totally ordered structures and coarse partitions. CST\ndefines hierarchical relations among sets and uses information-theoretic tools,\nsuch as Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to quantify the trade-off between\nsimplification and information loss. We demonstrate CST through applications in\neducational grading and explainable AI (XAI), showing how it enables more\ntransparent and context-sensitive evaluations. By grounding coarse evaluations\nin set theory and probabilistic reasoning, CST contributes to the ethical\ndesign of interpretable AI systems.

While traditional empirical and physics-based models\noffer approximate predictions of power generation based on wind speed, they\noften fail to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between other input\nvariables and the resulting power output. Data-driven machine learning methods\npresent a promising avenue for improving wind turbine modeling by leveraging\nlarge datasets, enhancing prediction accuracy but often at the cost of\ninterpretability. In this study, we propose a hybrid semi-parametric model that\ncombines the strengths of both approaches, applied to a dataset from a wind\nfarm with four turbines. The model integrates a physics-inspired submodel,\nproviding a reasonable approximation of power generation, with a non-parametric\nsubmodel that predicts the residuals. This non-parametric submodel is trained\non a broader range of variables to account for phenomena not captured by the\nphysics-based component. The hybrid model achieves a 37% improvement in\nprediction accuracy over the physics-based model. To enhance interpretability,\nSHAP values are used to analyze the influence of input features on the residual\nsubmodel's output. Additionally, prediction uncertainties are quantified using\na conformalized quantile regression method. The combination of these\ntechniques, alongside the physics grounding of the parametric submodel,\nprovides a flexible, accurate, and reliable framework.

Finally, we compute the nDTW metric\nbetween the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the\npath fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches\nthat use joint semantic maps like VLMaps \\cite{vlmaps} on the complex\nR2R-Habitat \\cite{r2r} instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of\nvisual grounding on navigation performance.",

    "abstract": "The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological\nprocesses, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. While\nmodern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing\nthese macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains\nunder-explored. In this paper, we follow the guidance of the central dogma to\nredesign both the data and model pipeline and offer a comprehensive framework,\nLife-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we\npropose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by\nreverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into\nnucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a\nhybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions of both coding and\nnon-coding regions with masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation\nand folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures\nof the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf\nprotein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex\ninteractions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive Experiments show\nthat Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks across\nthree omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and\ninterpretation.",

    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental problem in natural language\nprocessing (NLP). However, the task of extracting longer entity spans (e.g.,\nawards) from extended texts (e.g., homepages) is barely explored. Current NER\nmethods predominantly fall into two categories: span-based methods and\ngeneration-based methods. Span-based methods require the enumeration of all\npossible token-pair spans, followed by classification on each span, resulting\nin substantial redundant computations and excessive GPU memory usage. In\ncontrast, generation-based methods involve prompting or fine-tuning large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream NER tasks. However, these methods\nstruggle with the accurate generation of longer spans and often incur\nsignificant time costs for effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces a lightweight span-based NER method called SeNER, which\nincorporates a bidirectional arrow attention mechanism coupled with\nLogN-Scaling on the [CLS] token to embed long texts effectively, and comprises\na novel bidirectional sliding-window plus-shaped attention (BiSPA) mechanism to\nreduce redundant candidate token-pair spans significantly and model\ninteractions between token-pair spans simultaneously. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art extraction accuracy on\nthree long NER datasets and is capable of extracting entities from long texts\nin a GPU-memory-friendly manner.

However, unlike\nmost fields where DRL is widely used, the stock market is more volatile and\ndynamic as it is affected by several factors such as global events and investor\nsentiment. Therefore, it remains a challenge to construct a DRL-based portfolio\nmanagement framework with strong return capability, stable training, and\ngeneralization ability. This study introduces a new framework utilizing the\nMemory Instance Gated Transformer (MIGT) for effective portfolio management. By\nincorporating a novel Gated Instance Attention module, which combines a\ntransformer variant, instance normalization, and a Lite Gate Unit, our approach\naims to maximize investment returns while ensuring the learning process's\nstability and reducing outlier impacts. Tested on the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage 30, our framework's performance is evaluated against fifteen other\nstrategies using key financial metrics like the cumulative return and\nrisk-return ratios (Sharpe, Sortino, and Omega ratios). The results highlight\nMIGT's advantage, showcasing at least a 9.75% improvement in cumulative returns\nand a minimum 2.36% increase in risk-return ratios over competing strategies,\nmarking a significant advancement in DRL for portfolio management.",

As the agent cannot access extrinsic\nrewards during unsupervised exploration, existing methods design intrinsic\nrewards to model the explored data and encourage further exploration. However,\nthe explored data are always heterogeneous, posing the requirements of powerful\nrepresentation abilities for both intrinsic reward models and pre-trained\npolicies. In this work, we propose the Exploratory Diffusion Model (ExDM),\nwhich leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the\nexplored data, simultaneously boosting exploration and providing an efficient\ninitialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, ExDM can accurately estimate\nthe distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion\nmodel and introduces the score-based intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to\nexplore less-visited states. After obtaining the pre-trained policies, ExDM\nenables rapid adaptation to downstream tasks. In detail, we provide theoretical\nanalyses and practical algorithms for fine-tuning diffusion policies,\naddressing key challenges such as training instability and computational\ncomplexity caused by multi-step sampling.

However, in\nmodern computing environments-particularly those involving large foundation\nmodels-memory is inexpensive and abundant, while GPU time constitutes the main\ncost. This paper re-examines CL under a more realistic setting with sufficient\nexemplar memory, where the system can retain a representative portion of past\ndata. We find that, under this regime, stability improves due to reduced\nforgetting, but plasticity diminishes as the model becomes biased toward prior\ntasks and struggles to adapt to new ones. Notably, even simple baselines like\nnaive replay can match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art methods at\na fraction of the computational cost. Building on this insight, we propose a\nlightweight yet effective method called Weight Space Consolidation, which\ndirectly operates in the model's weight space via two core mechanisms: (1)\nrank-based parameter resets to recover plasticity, and (2) weight averaging to\nenhance stability. Our approach outperforms strong baselines across\nclass-incremental learning with image classifiers and continual instruction\ntuning with large language models, while requiring only one-third to one-fourth\nof the training cost. These findings challenge long-standing CL assumptions and\nestablish a new, cost-efficient baseline for real-world continual learning\nsystems where exemplar memory is no longer the limiting factor.",

Low-precision ADCs\ncan reduce this overhead but introduce partial-sum quantization errors\ndegrading accuracy. Additionally, low-bit weight constraints, imposed by cell\nlimitations and the need for multiple cells for higher-bit weights, present\nfurther challenges. While fine-grained partial-sum quantization has been\nstudied to lower ADC resolution effectively, weight granularity, which limits\noverall partial-sum quantized accuracy, remains underexplored.

CEs, defined as sequences of\nshort-term atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal rules, are\nchallenging to detect online due to the need to extract meaningful patterns\nfrom long and noisy sensor data while ignoring irrelevant events. We\nhypothesize that state-based methods are well-suited for CE detection, as they\ncapture event progression through state transitions without requiring long-term\nmemory. Baseline experiments validate this, demonstrating that the state-space\nmodel Mamba outperforms existing architectures. However, Mamba's reliance on\nextensive labeled data, which are difficult to obtain, motivates our second\nhypothesis: decoupling CE rule learning from noisy sensor data can reduce data\nrequirements. To address this, we propose NARCE, a framework that combines\nNeural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) to split the task into two components: (i)\nlearning CE rules independently of sensor data using synthetic concept traces\ngenerated by LLMs and (ii) mapping sensor inputs to these rules via an adapter.\nOur results show that NARCE outperforms baselines in accuracy, generalization\nto unseen and longer sensor data, and data efficiency, significantly reducing\nannotation costs while advancing robust CE detection.",

However, existing methods\nrely heavily on annotated data, and struggle with effectively disentangling\ntimbre and style, leading to challenges in achieving controllable generation,\nespecially in zero-shot scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Vevo, a\nversatile zero-shot voice imitation framework with controllable timbre and\nstyle. Vevo operates in two core stages: (1) Content-Style Modeling: Given\neither text or speech's content tokens as input, we utilize an autoregressive\ntransformer to generate the content-style tokens, which is prompted by a style\nreference; (2) Acoustic Modeling: Given the content-style tokens as input, we\nemploy a flow-matching transformer to produce acoustic representations, which\nis prompted by a timbre reference. To obtain the content and content-style\ntokens of speech, we design a fully self-supervised approach that progressively\ndecouples the timbre, style, and linguistic content of speech. Specifically, we\nadopt VQ-VAE as the tokenizer for the continuous hidden features of HuBERT. We\ntreat the vocabulary size of the VQ-VAE codebook as the information bottleneck,\nand adjust it carefully to obtain the disentangled speech representations.\nSolely self-supervised trained on 60K hours of audiobook speech data, without\nany fine-tuning on style-specific corpora, Vevo matches or surpasses existing\nmethods in accent and emotion conversion tasks. Additionally, Vevo's\neffectiveness in zero-shot voice conversion and text-to-speech tasks further\ndemonstrates its strong generalization and versatility.

This empowers individuals to understand, question, or alter\ndecisions that negatively affect them. However, due to the variety and\nsensitivity of system environments and individual personalities, quantifying\nthe cost of a single function is nearly impossible while considering multiple\ncriteria situations. Most current recourse mechanisms use gradient-based\nmethods that assume cost functions are differentiable, often not applicable in\nreal-world scenarios, resulting in sub-optimal solutions that compromise\nvarious criteria. These solutions are typically intractable and lack rigorous\ntheoretical foundations, raising concerns regarding interpretability,\nreliability, and transparency from the explainable AI (XAI) perspective.\n  To address these issues, this work proposes an algorithmic recourse framework\nthat handles non-differentiable and discrete multi-cost functions.

These datasets consist of image-text pairs where the text\nis restricted to the simple vocabulary and syntax typically used by young\nchildren, generated with a scaled-down model, GPT-4o. Using these datasets, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to train VLMs that are significantly smaller,\nup to 10 times smaller than state of the art(SOTA) small VLMs while maintaining\narchitectural simplicity. To evaluate the outputs, we leverage GPT-4o to grade\nthe text, as if stories written by students, on creativity, meaningfulness, and\nconsistency, assigning scores out of 10. This method addresses limitations of\nstandard benchmarks by accommodating unstructured outputs and providing a\nmultidimensional evaluation of the model capabilities. Our findings contribute\nto the development of lightweight, accessible multimodal models for resource\nconstrained environments.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), solving complex\nreasoning tasks has gained increasing attention. Inference-time computation\nmethods (e.g., Best-of-N, beam search, et al.) are particularly valuable as\nthey can enhance reasoning performance without modifying model parameters or\nrequiring additional training. However, these techniques come with\nimplementation challenges, and most existing methods remain at the\nproof-of-concept stage with limited practical adoption due to their\ncomputational complexity and varying effectiveness across different tasks. In\nthis paper, we investigate and benchmark diverse inference-time computation\nstrategies across reasoning tasks of varying complexity. Since most current\nmethods rely on a proposer-verifier pipeline that first generates candidate\nsolutions (e.g., reasoning solutions) and then selects the best one based on\nreward signals (e.g., RLHF rewards, process rewards), our research focuses on\noptimizing both candidate solution generation (e.g., instructing prompts,\nhyperparameters such as temperature and top-p) and reward mechanisms (e.g.,\nself-evaluation, reward types). Through extensive experiments (more than 20,000\nA100-80G GPU hours with over 1,000 experiments) across a variety of models\n(e.g., Llama, Qwen, and Mistral families) of various sizes, our ablation\nstudies reveal that previously overlooked strategies can significantly enhance\nperformance (e.g., tuning temperature can improve reasoning task performance by\nup to 5%). Furthermore, we establish a standardized benchmark for\ninference-time computation by systematically evaluating six representative\nmethods across eight reasoning tasks. These findings provide a stronger\nfoundation for future research. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/usail-hkust/benchmark_inference_time_computation_LLM",

    "abstract": "Insulators are crucial insulation components and structural supports in power\ngrids, playing a vital role in the transmission lines. Due to temperature\nfluctuations, internal stress, or damage from hail, insulators are prone to\ninjury. Automatic detection of damaged insulators faces challenges such as\ndiverse types, small defect targets, and complex backgrounds and shapes. Most\nresearch for detecting insulator defects has focused on a single defect type or\na specific material. However, the insulators in the grid's transmission lines\nhave different colors and materials. Various insulator defects coexist, and the\nexisting methods have difficulty meeting the practical application\nrequirements. Current methods suffer from low detection accuracy and mAP0.5\ncannot meet application requirements. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv7\nmodel for multi-type insulator defect detection. First, our model replaces the\nSPPCSPC module with the RFB module to enhance the network's feature extraction\ncapability. Second, a CA mechanism is introduced into the head part to enhance\nthe network's feature representation ability and to improve detection accuracy.\nThird, a WIoU loss function is employed to address the low-quality samples\nhindering model generalization during training, thereby improving the model's\noverall performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model\nexhibits enhancements across various performance metrics. Specifically, there\nis a 1.6% advancement in mAP_0.5, a corresponding 1.6% enhancement in\nmAP_0.5:0.95, a 1.3% elevation in precision, and a 1% increase in recall.\nMoreover, the model achieves parameter reduction by 3.2 million, leading to a\ndecrease of 2.5 GFLOPS in computational cost.

However,\nassessing the quality of AI-generated code remains a challenge due to the\ninherent complexity of programming tasks and the lack of robust evaluation\nmetrics that align well with human judgment. Traditional token-based metrics\nsuch as BLEU and ROUGE, while commonly used in natural language processing,\nexhibit weak correlations with human assessments in code intelligence and\nverification tasks. Furthermore, these metrics are primarily research focused\nand are not designed for seamless integration into the software development\nlifecycle, limiting their practical utility for developers seeking to improve\ncode quality and security.\n  AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior\ndevelopers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated\ncode for correctness, completeness, and compliance.

To bridge this gap, This paper introduces\na novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse\ngeneration technique that leverages the natural language generation\ncapabilities of LLMs. Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs\nsystem requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original\nspecifications to quantify accuracy.

While our data and\nmethods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a\nsingle platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI's\nevolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future\nimpact as these technologies continue to advance.",

We extend the Latent Shift\ncounterfactual generation method from 2D applications to explain 3D computed\ntomography (CT) scans classifiers. We address the challenges associated with 3D\nclassifiers, such as limited training samples and high memory demands, by\nimplementing a slice-based autoencoder and gradient blocking except for\nspecific chunks of slices. This method leverages a 2D encoder trained on CT\nslices, which are subsequently combined to maintain 3D context. We demonstrate\nthis technique on two models for clinical phenotype prediction and lung\nsegmentation.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the power of\nscaling test-time compute to achieve strong performance on complex tasks, such\nas mathematical reasoning and code generation. This raises a critical question:\nhow should model training be modified to optimize performance under a\nsubsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on\npass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$\nindependent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy\n(CE) loss can be ${\\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\\it\ndecreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment\nin terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our\nprediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via\npass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is\nbetter aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test\nperformance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH\nand MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math\nquestions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying\nshapes. Overall our work underscores the importance of co-designing two\ntraditionally separate phases of LLM development: training-time protocols and\ntest-time search and reasoning strategies.",

    "abstract": "While Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing\ntasks, their growing computational and memory demands make deployment on\nresource-constrained devices like mobile phones increasingly challenging. In\nthis paper, we propose SHARP (SHaring Adjacent Layers with Recovery\nParameters), a novel approach to accelerate LLM inference by sharing parameters\nacross adjacent layers, thus reducing memory load overhead, while introducing\nlow-rank recovery parameters to maintain performance. Inspired by observations\nthat consecutive layers have similar outputs, SHARP employs a two-stage\nrecovery process: Single Layer Warmup (SLW), and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).\nThe SLW stage aligns the outputs of the shared layers using L_2 loss, providing\na good initialization for the following SFT stage to further restore the model\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHARP can recover the\nmodel's perplexity on various in-distribution tasks using no more than 50k\nfine-tuning data while reducing the number of stored MLP parameters by 38% to\n65%. We also conduct several ablation studies of SHARP and show that replacing\nlayers towards the later parts of the model yields better performance\nretention, and that different recovery parameterizations perform similarly when\nparameter counts are matched. Furthermore, SHARP saves 42.8% in model storage\nand reduces the total inference time by 42.2% compared to the original\nLlama2-7b model on mobile devices. Our results highlight SHARP as an efficient\nsolution for reducing inference costs in deploying LLMs without the need for\npretraining-scale resources.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous machine learning systems that learn many tasks in sequence are\nprone to the catastrophic forgetting problem. Mathematical theory is needed in\norder to understand the extent of forgetting during continual learning. As a\nfoundational step towards this goal, we study continual learning and\ncatastrophic forgetting from a theoretical perspective in the simple setting of\ngradient descent with no explicit algorithmic mechanism to prevent forgetting.\nIn this setting, we analytically demonstrate that overparameterization alone\ncan mitigate forgetting in the context of a linear regression model. We\nconsider a two-task setting motivated by permutation tasks, and show that as\nthe overparameterization ratio becomes sufficiently high, a model trained on\nboth tasks in sequence results in a low-risk estimator for the first task. As\npart of this work, we establish a non-asymptotic bound of the risk of a single\nlinear regression task, which may be of independent interest to the field of\ndouble descent theory.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance in\naligning visual and textual representations, excelling in tasks like image\nretrieval and zero-shot classification. Despite this success, the mechanisms by\nwhich these models utilize training data, particularly the role of\nmemorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and\nself-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for\ngeneralization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would\napply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via\ncaptions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from\nself-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in\nunderstanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem)\nand use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that\nCLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised\nparadigms, with \"mis-captioned\" samples exhibiting highest levels of\nmemorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to\nmemorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies\nshould focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose\nmultiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving\nutility--something that had not been shown before for traditional learning\nparadigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement in building large language models (LLMs) has\nintensified competition among big-tech companies and AI startups. In this\nregard, model evaluations are critical for product and investment-related\ndecision-making. While open evaluation sets like MMLU initially drove progress,\nconcerns around data contamination and data bias have constantly questioned\ntheir reliability. As a result, it has led to the rise of private data curators\nwho have begun conducting hidden evaluations with high-quality self-curated\ntest prompts and their own expert annotators. In this paper, we argue that\ndespite potential advantages in addressing contamination issues, private\nevaluations introduce inadvertent financial and evaluation risks. In\nparticular, the key concerns include the potential conflict of interest arising\nfrom private data curators' business relationships with their clients (leading\nLLM firms). In addition, we highlight that the subjective preferences of\nprivate expert annotators will lead to inherent evaluation bias towards the\nmodels trained with the private curators' data. Overall, this paper lays the\nfoundation for studying the risks of private evaluations that can lead to\nwide-ranging community discussions and policy changes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved great\nsuccess in fine-tuning diffusion-based generative models. However, fine-tuning\ncontinuous flow-based generative models to align with arbitrary user-defined\nreward functions remains challenging, particularly due to issues such as policy\ncollapse from overoptimization and the prohibitively high computational cost of\nlikelihoods in continuous-time flows. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use\nand theoretically sound RL fine-tuning method, which we term Online\nReward-Weighted Conditional Flow Matching with Wasserstein-2 Regularization\n(ORW-CFM-W2). Our method integrates RL into the flow matching framework to\nfine-tune generative models with arbitrary reward functions, without relying on\ngradients of rewards or filtered datasets. By introducing an online\nreward-weighting mechanism, our approach guides the model to prioritize\nhigh-reward regions in the data manifold. To prevent policy collapse and\nmaintain diversity, we incorporate Wasserstein-2 (W2) distance regularization\ninto our method and derive a tractable upper bound for it in flow matching,\neffectively balancing exploration and exploitation of policy optimization. We\nprovide theoretical analyses to demonstrate the convergence properties and\ninduced data distributions of our method, establishing connections with\ntraditional RL algorithms featuring Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization and\noffering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and\nlearning behavior of our approach. Extensive experiments on tasks including\ntarget image generation, image compression, and text-image alignment\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where our method achieves optimal\npolicy convergence while allowing controllable trade-offs between reward\nmaximization and diversity preservation.",

    "abstract": "Communicating in natural language is a powerful tool in multi-agent settings,\nas it enables independent agents to share information in partially observable\nsettings and allows zero-shot coordination with humans. However, most prior\nworks are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human\ndemonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication\nstrategies. In this work, we train language models to have productive\ndiscussions about their environment in natural language without any human\ndemonstrations. We decompose the communication problem into listening and\nspeaking. Our key idea is to leverage the agent's goal to predict useful\ninformation about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication.\nSpecifically, we improve a model's listening skills by training them to predict\ninformation about the environment based on discussions, and we simultaneously\nimprove a model's speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by\nrewarding messages based on their influence on other agents. To investigate the\nrole and necessity of communication in complex social settings, we study an\nembodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to\nanswer is the identity of an adversarial imposter. We analyze emergent\nbehaviors due to our technique, such as accusing suspects and providing\nevidence, and find that it enables strong discussions, doubling the win rates\ncompared to standard RL.

    "abstract": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits pose a significant threat to AI and ML\nsystems, particularly in GPU-accelerated environments where the computational\npower of GPUs can be misused for malicious purposes. This paper focuses on RCE\nattacks leveraging deserialization vulnerabilities and custom layers, such as\nTensorFlow Lambda layers, which are often overlooked due to the complexity of\nmonitoring GPU workloads. These vulnerabilities enable attackers to execute\narbitrary code, blending malicious activity seamlessly into expected model\nbehavior and exploiting GPUs for unauthorized tasks such as cryptocurrency\nmining. Unlike traditional CPU-based attacks, the parallel processing nature of\nGPUs and their high resource utilization make runtime detection exceptionally\nchallenging. In this work, we provide a comprehensive examination of RCE\nexploits targeting GPUs, demonstrating an attack that utilizes these\nvulnerabilities to deploy a crypto miner on a GPU. We highlight the technical\nintricacies of such attacks, emphasize their potential for significant\nfinancial and computational costs, and propose strategies for mitigation. By\nshedding light on this underexplored attack vector, we aim to raise awareness\nand encourage the adoption of robust security measures in GPU-driven AI and ML\nsystems, with an emphasis on static and model scanning as an easier way to\ndetect exploits.",

To answer this, we curate a novel dataset consisting\nof 1338 drawings by children, adults and AI on a creative drawing task. We\ncharacterize two aspects of the drawings -- (1) style and (2) content. For\nstyle, we define measures of ink density, ink distribution and number of\nelements. For content, we use expert-annotated categories to study conceptual\ndiversity, and image and text embeddings to compute distance measures. We\ncompare the style, content and creativity of children, adults and AI drawings\nand build simple models to predict expert and automated creativity scores. We\nfind significant differences in style and content in the groups -- children's\ndrawings had more components, AI drawings had greater ink density, and adult\ndrawings revealed maximum conceptual diversity. Notably, we highlight a\nmisalignment between creativity judgments obtained through expert and automated\nratings and discuss its implications.

These\nissues are because a cascade-based method uses a combination of methods such as\nspeech recognition, speech-to-text translation, and finally, text-to-speech\ntranslation. Translatotron, a sequence-to-sequence direct speech-to-speech\ntranslation model was designed by Google to address the issues of compound\nerrors associated with cascade model. Today there are 3 versions of the\nTranslatotron model: Translatotron 1, Translatotron 2, and Translatotron3. The\nfirst version was designed as a proof of concept to show that a direct\nspeech-to-speech translation was possible, it was found to be less effective\nthan the cascade model but was producing promising results. Translatotron2 was\nan improved version of Translatotron 1 with results similar to the cascade\nmodel. Translatotron 3 the latest version of the model is better than the\ncascade model at some points. In this paper, a complete review of\nspeech-to-speech translation will be presented, with a particular focus on all\nthe versions of Translatotron models.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale machine learning have produced high-capacity\nfoundation models capable of adapting to a broad array of downstream tasks.\nWhile such models hold great promise for robotics, the prevailing paradigm\nstill portrays robots as single, autonomous decision-makers, performing tasks\nlike manipulation and navigation, with limited human involvement. However, a\nlarge class of real-world robotic systems, including wearable robotics (e.g.,\nprostheses, orthoses, exoskeletons), teleoperation, and neural interfaces, are\nsemiautonomous, and require ongoing interactive coordination with human\npartners, challenging single-agent assumptions. In this position paper, we\nargue that robot foundation models must evolve to an interactive multi-agent\nperspective in order to handle the complexities of real-time human-robot\nco-adaptation. We propose a generalizable, neuroscience-inspired architecture\nencompassing four modules: (1) a multimodal sensing module informed by\nsensorimotor integration principles, (2) an ad-hoc teamwork model reminiscent\nof joint-action frameworks in cognitive science, (3) a predictive world belief\nmodel grounded in internal model theories of motor control, and (4) a\nmemory/feedback mechanism that echoes concepts of Hebbian and\nreinforcement-based plasticity. Although illustrated through the lens of cyborg\nsystems, where wearable devices and human physiology are inseparably\nintertwined, the proposed framework is broadly applicable to robots operating\nin semi-autonomous or interactive contexts.

Our method applies fine-grained\ninterventions at specific model subcomponents, particularly attention heads,\nusing a simple binary choice probing strategy. These interventions then\ngeneralise to the open-ended generation setting effectively circumventing\nsafety guardrails. We show that probing single attention heads is more\neffective than intervening on full layers and intervening on only four\nattention heads is comparable to supervised fine-tuning. We further show that\nonly a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering\ndirections, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning.

More specifically, when they are proficient enough to\ncollaborate with us, how long does coordination take, and when is it\ncomputationally feasible? These foundational questions of AI alignment help\ndefine what makes an AI agent ``sufficiently safe'' and valuable to humans.\nSince such generally capable systems do not yet exist, a theoretical analysis\nis needed to establish when guarantees hold -- and what they even are.\n  We introduce a game-theoretic framework that generalizes prior alignment\napproaches with fewer assumptions, allowing us to analyze the computational\ncomplexity of alignment across $M$ objectives and $N$ agents, providing both\nupper and lower bounds. Unlike previous work, which often assumes common\npriors, idealized communication, or implicit tractability, our framework\nformally characterizes the difficulty of alignment under minimal assumptions.\n  Our main result shows that even when agents are fully rational and\ncomputationally \\emph{unbounded}, alignment can be achieved with high\nprobability in time \\emph{linear} in the task space size. Therefore, in\nreal-world settings, where task spaces are often \\emph{exponential} in input\nlength, this remains impractical. More strikingly, our lower bound demonstrates\nthat alignment is \\emph{impossible} to speed up when scaling to exponentially\nmany tasks or agents, highlighting a fundamental computational barrier to\nscalable alignment.\n  Relaxing these idealized assumptions, we study \\emph{computationally bounded}\nagents with noisy messages (representing obfuscated intent), showing that while\nalignment can still succeed with high probability, it incurs additional\n\\emph{exponential} slowdowns in the task space size, number of agents, and\nnumber of tasks.\n  We conclude by identifying conditions that make alignment more feasible.",

This paradigm becomes increasingly\npopular in the development of autonomous agents, as it develops systems that\ncan self-evolve in response to new challenges like human beings. However,\nprevious methods suffer from limited training efficiency when expanding new\nskills and fail to fully leverage prior knowledge to facilitate new task\nlearning. In this paper, we propose Parametric Skill Expansion and Composition\n(PSEC), a new framework designed to iteratively evolve the agents' capabilities\nand efficiently address new challenges by maintaining a manageable skill\nlibrary. This library can progressively integrate skill primitives as\nplug-and-play Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules in parameter-efficient\nfinetuning, facilitating efficient and flexible skill expansion. This structure\nalso enables the direct skill compositions in parameter space by merging LoRA\nmodules that encode different skills, leveraging shared information across\nskills to effectively program new skills. Based on this, we propose a\ncontext-aware module to dynamically activate different skills to\ncollaboratively handle new tasks. Empowering diverse applications including\nmulti-objective composition, dynamics shift, and continual policy shift, the\nresults on D4RL, DSRL benchmarks, and the DeepMind Control Suite show that PSEC\nexhibits superior capacity to leverage prior knowledge to efficiently tackle\nnew challenges, as well as expand its skill libraries to evolve the\ncapabilities.

    "abstract": "EEG-based neural networks, pivotal in medical diagnosis and brain-computer\ninterfaces, face significant intellectual property (IP) risks due to their\nreliance on sensitive neurophysiological data and resource-intensive\ndevelopment. Current watermarking methods, particularly those using abstract\ntrigger sets, lack robust authentication and fail to address the unique\nchallenges of EEG models. This paper introduces a cryptographic wonder\nfilter-based watermarking framework tailored for EEG-based neural networks.\nLeveraging collision-resistant hashing and public-key encryption, the wonder\nfilter embeds the watermark during training, ensuring minimal distortion ($\\leq\n5\\%$ drop in EEG task accuracy) and high reliability (100\\% watermark\ndetection). The framework is rigorously evaluated against adversarial attacks,\nincluding fine-tuning, transfer learning, and neuron pruning. Results\ndemonstrate persistent watermark retention, with classification accuracy for\nwatermarked states remaining above 90\\% even after aggressive pruning, while\nprimary task performance degrades faster, deterring removal attempts. Piracy\nresistance is validated by the inability to embed secondary watermarks without\nsevere accuracy loss ( $>10\\%$ in EEGNet and CCNN models). Cryptographic\nhashing ensures authentication, reducing brute-force attack success\nprobabilities. Evaluated on the DEAP dataset across models (CCNN, EEGNet,\nTSception), the method achieves $>99.4\\%$ null-embedding accuracy, effectively\neliminating false positives. By integrating wonder filters with EEG-specific\nadaptations, this work bridges a critical gap in IP protection for\nneurophysiological models, offering a secure, tamper-proof solution for\nhealthcare and biometric applications. The framework's robustness against\nadversarial modifications underscores its potential to safeguard sensitive EEG\nmodels while maintaining diagnostic utility.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enabled processing of\nlarger inputs, leading everyday software developers to increasingly rely on\nchat-based large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to detect\nvulnerabilities across entire files, not just within functions. This new\ndevelopment practice requires researchers to urgently investigate whether\ncommonly used LLMs can effectively analyze large file-sized inputs, in order to\nprovide timely insights for software developers and engineers about the pros\nand cons of this emerging technological trend. Hence, the goal of this paper is\nto evaluate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art chat-based LLMs,\nincluding the GPT models, in detecting in-file vulnerabilities. We conducted a\ncostly investigation into how the performance of LLMs varies based on\nvulnerability type, input size, and vulnerability location within the file. To\ngive enough statistical power to our study, we could only focus on the three\nmost common (as well as dangerous) vulnerabilities: XSS, SQL injection, and\npath traversal. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of LLMs in\ndetecting these vulnerabilities is strongly influenced by both the location of\nthe vulnerability and the overall size of the input. Specifically, regardless\nof the vulnerability type, LLMs tend to significantly (p < .05) underperform\nwhen detecting vulnerabilities located toward the end of larger files, a\npattern we call the 'lost-in-the-end' effect. Finally, to further support\nsoftware developers and practitioners, we also explored the optimal input size\nfor these LLMs and presented a simple strategy for identifying it, which can be\napplied to other models and vulnerability types. Eventually, we show how\nadjusting the input size can lead to significant improvements in LLM-based\nvulnerability detection, with an average recall increase of over 37% across all\nmodels.",

Due to the nascency of the field, it is not well-established\nwhether LMs exhibit similar learning dynamics to humans, and there are few\ndirect comparisons between learning trajectories in humans and models. Word\nlearning trajectories for children are relatively well-documented, and recent\nwork has tried to extend these investigations to language models. However,\nthere are no widely agreed-upon metrics for word learning in language models.\nWe take a distributional approach to this problem, defining lexical knowledge\nin terms of properties of the learned distribution for a target word. We argue\nthat distributional signatures studied in prior work fail to capture key\ndistributional information. Thus, we propose an array of signatures that\nimprove on earlier approaches by capturing knowledge of both where the target\nword can and cannot occur as well as gradient preferences about the word's\nappropriateness. We obtain learning trajectories for a selection of small\nlanguage models we train from scratch, study the relationship between different\ndistributional signatures, compare how well they align with human word learning\ntrajectories and interpretable lexical features, and address basic\nmethodological questions about estimating these distributional signatures. Our\nmetrics largely capture complementary information, suggesting that it is\nimportant not to rely on a single metric.

    "abstract": "Real-world sensing challenges such as sensor failures, communication issues,\nand power constraints lead to data intermittency. An issue that is known to\nundermine the traditional classification task that assumes a continuous data\nstream. Previous works addressed this issue by designing bespoke solutions\n(i.e. task-specific and/or modality-specific imputation). These approaches,\nwhile effective for their intended purposes, had limitations in their\napplicability across different tasks and sensor modalities. This raises an\nimportant question: Can we build a task-agnostic imputation pipeline that is\ntransferable to new sensors without requiring additional training? In this\nwork, we formalise the concept of zero-shot imputation and propose a novel\napproach that enables the adaptation of pre-trained models to handle data\nintermittency. This framework, named NeuralPrefix, is a generative neural\ncomponent that precedes a task model during inference, filling in gaps caused\nby data intermittency. NeuralPrefix is built as a continuous dynamical system,\nwhere its internal state can be estimated at any point in time by solving an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE). This approach allows for a more versatile\nand adaptable imputation method, overcoming the limitations of task-specific\nand modality-specific solutions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nNeuralPrefix on multiple sensory datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness\nacross various domains. When tested on intermittent data with a high 50%\nmissing data rate, NeuralPreifx accurately recovers all the missing samples,\nachieving SSIM score between 0.93-0.96. Zero-shot evaluations show that\nNeuralPrefix generalises well to unseen datasets, even when the measurements\ncome from a different modality.",

Recent\nadvancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in addressing\nmental health challenges, including the detection of depression through\ntext-based analysis. However, current LLM-based methods often struggle with\nnuanced symptom identification and lack a transparent, step-by-step reasoning\nprocess, making it difficult to accurately classify and explain mental health\nconditions. To address these challenges, we propose a Chain-of-Thought\nPrompting approach that enhances both the performance and interpretability of\nLLM-based depression detection.

By\nguiding the model through these structured reasoning steps, we improve\ninterpretability and reduce the risk of overlooking subtle clinical indicators.\nWe validate our method on the E-DAIC dataset, where we test multiple\nstate-of-the-art large language models.

We then fine-tuned\nselected models (GPT-4, Phi-3.5 2.7B, Qwen-2.5 3B, Gemma-2 9B, and Deepseek R1\ndistilled Qwen 1.5B) to optimize their performance.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in natural\nlanguage processing but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually\nincorrect or fabricated content. This issue undermines their reliability,\nparticularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and legal advisory. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Delta, an inference-time method that reduces\nhallucinations without requiring model retraining or additional data. Delta\nworks by randomly masking parts of the input prompt and contrasting the output\ndistributions for the original and masked inputs, effectively suppressing\nhallucinations through inference-only computations. We evaluate Delta on\ncontext-rich question-answering benchmarks, achieving absolute improvements of\napproximately 3 and 6 percentage points on SQuAD v1.1 and v2, respectively, and\n7 and 2 percentage points on TriviaQA and Natural Questions under-sampling\ndecoding. Delta also improves the no-answer exact match score on SQuAD v2 by\nover ten percentage points, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating\nhallucinations arising from contextual ambiguity. These results highlight Delta\nas a computationally efficient and scalable approach for improving the\nreliability of LLMs in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Mixture of Experts (MoE), with its distinctive sparse structure, enables the\nscaling of language models up to trillions of parameters without significantly\nincreasing computational costs. However, the substantial parameter size\npresents a challenge for inference, as the expansion in GPU memory cannot keep\npace with the growth in parameters. Although offloading techniques utilise\nmemory from the CPU and disk and parallelise the I/O and computation for\nefficiency, the computation for each expert in MoE models is often less than\nthe I/O, resulting in numerous bubbles in the pipeline.\n  Therefore, we propose Klotski, an efficient MoE inference engine that\nsignificantly reduces pipeline bubbles through a novel expert-aware multi-batch\npipeline paradigm. The proposed paradigm uses batch processing to extend the\ncomputation time of the current layer to overlap with the loading time of the\nnext layer. Although this idea has been effectively applied to dense models,\nmore batches may activate more experts in the MoE, leading to longer loading\ntimes and more bubbles. Thus, unlike traditional approaches, we balance\ncomputation and I/O time and minimise bubbles by orchestrating their inference\norders based on their heterogeneous computation and I/O requirements and\nactivation patterns under different batch numbers. Moreover, to adapt to\ndifferent hardware environments and models, we design a constraint-sensitive\nI/O-compute planner and a correlation-aware expert prefetcher for a schedule\nthat minimises pipeline bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate that Klotski\nachieves a superior throughput-latency trade-off compared to state-of-the-art\ntechniques, with throughput improvements of up to 85.12x.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights,\nexplains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language\nModels(LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected.\nWe first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular\nfamilies of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis,\ntheoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the\nineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer\nNormalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer\nLLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which\nundesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an\nidentity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve\nthis training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling, which scales the variance\nof output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth.\nThis simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper\nTransformer layers, improving their contribution. Our experimental results,\nspanning model sizes from 130M to 1B, demonstrate that LayerNorm Scaling\nsignificantly enhances LLM pre-training performance compared to Pre-LN.\nMoreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning.\nAll these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables\ndeeper layers to contribute more effectively during training.",

More\nimportantly, maintaining high modeling accuracy without losing physical\nanalyzability remains to be solved. To this end, this paper proposes a novel\nphysics-encoded deep learning network, named PeMTFLN, to model the nonlinear\nvehicle platoon dynamics. Specifically, an analyzable parameters encoded\ncomputational graph (APeCG) is designed to guide the platoon to respond to the\ndriving behavior of the lead vehicle while ensuring local stability. Besides, a\nmulti-scale trajectory feature learning network (MTFLN) is constructed to\ncapture platoon following patterns and infer the physical parameters required\nfor APeCG from trajectory data. The human-driven vehicle trajectory datasets\n(HIGHSIM) were used to train the proposed PeMTFLN. The trajectories prediction\nexperiments show that PeMTFLN exhibits superior compared to the baseline models\nin terms of predictive accuracy in speed and gap. The stability analysis result\nshows that the physical parameters in APeCG is able to reproduce the platoon\nstability in real-world condition. In simulation experiments, PeMTFLN performs\nlow inference error in platoon trajectories generation. Moreover, PeMTFLN also\naccurately reproduces ground-truth safety statistics.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to\nestablish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising\nresults in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches\nfrequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a\ncomprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address\nthese limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges\nbased on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through\nan SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal\ncontroller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models.\nWe demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform\nconstitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty\ncoefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a\ntunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between\ncontrol costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail\npreservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with\nexisting diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications.\nExtensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the\nsuperiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential artificial generic\nintelligence recently, however, their usage is costly with high response\nlatency. Given mixed LLMs with their own strengths and weaknesses, LLM routing\naims to identify the most suitable model for each query in the stream to\nmaximize response quality and minimize cost and latency. However, the\nchallenges involve: (1) dynamic trade-offs among quality, cost, and latency;\n(2) enabling continual learning in deployed systems; and (3) navigating a\nvarying (e.g., new LLM addition or old LLM removal) set of LLM candidates over\ntime. To bridge these gaps, we develop MixLLM, a dynamic\ncontextual-bandit-based routing system for query-LLM assignment. Specifically,\nwe first leverage query tags to enhance query embeddings for the routing task.\nNext, we design lightweight prediction models to estimate the response\nqualities and costs of queries over LLMs. We then devise a meta-decision maker\nto choose the query-LLM assignments to best tradeoff response quality, cost,\nand latency. Finally, the system benefits from continual training, allowing it\nto adapt to evolving queries and user feedback over time. Our extensive\nexperiments show that MixLLM achieves the best trade-offs in response quality,\ncost, and latency (97.25% of GPT-4's quality at 24.18% of the cost under the\ntime constraint).",

    "abstract": "There is a general concern that present developments in artificial\nintelligence (AI) research will lead to sentient AI systems, and these may pose\nan existential threat to humanity. But why cannot sentient AI systems benefit\nhumanity instead? This paper endeavours to put this question in a tractable\nmanner. I ask whether a putative AI system will develop an altruistic or a\nmalicious disposition towards our society, or what would be the nature of its\nagency? Given that AI systems are being developed into formidable problem\nsolvers, we can reasonably expect these systems to preferentially take on\nconscious aspects of human problem solving. I identify the relevant phenomenal\naspects of agency in human problem solving. The functional aspects of conscious\nagency can be monitored using tools provided by functionalist theories of\nconsciousness. A recent expert report (Butlin et al. 2023) has identified\nfunctionalist indicators of agency based on these theories. I show how to use\nthe Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness, to monitor the\nphenomenal nature of this agency. If we are able to monitor the agency of AI\nsystems as they develop, then we can dissuade them from becoming a menace to\nsociety while encouraging them to be an aid.",

    "abstract": "Accurate acquisition of surface meteorological conditions at arbitrary\nlocations holds significant importance for weather forecasting and climate\nsimulation. Due to the fact that meteorological states derived from satellite\nobservations are often provided in the form of low-resolution grid fields, the\ndirect application of spatial interpolation to obtain meteorological states for\nspecific locations often results in significant discrepancies when compared to\nactual observations. Existing downscaling methods for acquiring meteorological\nstate information at higher resolutions commonly overlook the correlation with\nsatellite observations. To bridge the gap, we propose Satellite-observations\nGuided Diffusion Model (SGD), a conditional diffusion model pre-trained on ERA5\nreanalysis data with satellite observations (GridSat) as conditions, which is\nemployed for sampling downscaled meteorological states through a zero-shot\nguided sampling strategy and patch-based methods. During the training process,\nwe propose to fuse the information from GridSat satellite observations into\nERA5 maps via the attention mechanism, enabling SGD to generate atmospheric\nstates that align more accurately with actual conditions. In the sampling, we\nemployed optimizable convolutional kernels to simulate the upscale process,\nthereby generating high-resolution ERA5 maps using low-resolution ERA5 maps as\nwell as observations from weather stations as guidance. Moreover, our devised\npatch-based method promotes SGD to generate meteorological states at arbitrary\nresolutions. Experiments demonstrate SGD fulfills accurate meteorological\nstates downscaling to 6.25km.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code) excel at code generation tasks,\nyielding promise to release developers from huge software development burdens.\nNonetheless, these models have been shown to suffer from the significant\nprivacy risks due to the potential leakage of sensitive information embedded\nduring training, known as the memorization problem. Addressing this issue is\ncrucial for ensuring privacy compliance and upholding user trust, but till now\nthere is a dearth of dedicated studies in the literature that focus on this\nspecific direction. Recently, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising\nsolution by enabling models to \"forget\" sensitive information without full\nretraining, offering an efficient and scalable approach compared to traditional\ndata cleaning methods. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness\nof unlearning techniques for addressing privacy concerns in\nLLMs4Code.Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art unlearning\nalgorithms and three well-known open-sourced LLMs4Code, on a benchmark that\ntakes into consideration both the privacy data to be forgotten as well as the\ncode generation capabilites of these models. Results show that it is feasible\nto mitigate the privacy concerns of LLMs4Code through machine unlearning while\nmaintain their code generation capabilities at the same time. We also dissect\nthe forms of privacy protection/leakage after unlearning and observe that there\nis a shift from direct leakage to indirect leakage, which underscores the need\nfor future studies addressing this risk.",

    "abstract": "Fact-checking the truthfulness of claims usually requires reasoning over\nmultiple evidence sentences. Oftentimes, evidence sentences may not be always\nself-contained, and may require additional contexts and references from\nelsewhere to understand coreferential expressions, acronyms, and the scope of a\nreported finding. For example, evidence sentences from an academic paper may\nneed contextual sentences in the paper and descriptions in its cited papers to\ndetermine the scope of a research discovery. However, most fact-checking models\nmainly focus on the reasoning within evidence sentences, and ignore the\nauxiliary contexts and references. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nmethod, Context- and Reference-augmented Reasoning and Prompting. For evidence\nreasoning, we construct a three-layer evidence graph with evidence, context,\nand reference layers. We design intra- and cross-layer reasoning to integrate\nthree graph layers into a unified evidence embedding. For verdict prediction,\nwe design evidence-conditioned prompt encoder, which produces unique prompt\nembeddings for each claim. These evidence-conditioned prompt embeddings and\nclaims are unified for fact-checking. Experiments verify the strength of our\nmodel.",

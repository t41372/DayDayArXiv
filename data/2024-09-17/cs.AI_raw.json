    "abstract": "We propose a variant of chain of thought (CoT) prompting called Program Trace\nPrompting that makes explanations more observable while preserving the power,\ngenerality and flexibility of CoT. In our approach, few-shot CoT demonstrations\nare wrapped in a formal syntax based on Python, and each prompt: identifies and\nnames steps; defines the input/output behavior of steps; and replaces CoT\nexplanations of in-context examples with chains of these formalized steps on\nthe same examples. Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks,\nachieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard\nbenchmark. More importantly, by instrumenting explanations in this way, we\nenable new types of analysis. In particular, we identify \"non-local errors\"\n(which correspond to incorrectly learning the reasoning method illustrated in\nthe demonstrations) as an unaddressed issue in CoT learning, and we present\nmethods for verifying the modularity of steps in a CoT explanation.",

The analysis is framed on the\nextreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the\nOroville dam spillway incident in Northern California. Past and future\nsimulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the\npre-industrial and the late-21st century temperature climate change signals,\nrespectively. The simulations are compared to results from a dynamical model\nwhich represents plausible pseudo-realities under both climate environments.\nOverall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5-6 % increase in\nthe integrated water vapor over the Oroville dam in the present day compared to\nthe pre-industrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different\ngeopotential-moisture-temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the\nAI-models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the\nphysicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to\nsimulate weaker attribution values than the pseudo-reality imagined by the\ndynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for\nthe late-21st century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model (>500\nmembers) produced statistically significant present-day to pre-industrial\nattribution results, unlike the >20-member ensemble from the dynamical model.\nThis analysis highlights the potential of AI models to conduct attribution\nanalysis, while emphasizing future lines of work on explainable artificial\nintelligence to gain confidence in these tools, which can enable reliable\nattribution studies in real-time.",

    "abstract": "Modern language models frequently include retrieval components to improve\ntheir outputs, giving rise to a growing number of retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) systems. Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized\nfair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all\nstakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG\nsystems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking\nfairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources\ncited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e.,\nwhether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this\naffects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of\ncited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that\nfairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking\neffectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that\nfairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval\nleads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the\ncited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the\nimportance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation\nphases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG\nsystems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair\nranking and source attribution.",

The review covers key\ndiscourse comprehension accounts, including Construction-Integration, Event\nIndexing, Causal Network, and Resonance models, highlighting their\ncontributions to understanding cognitive processes in comprehension. I then\ndiscuss contemporary theoretical frameworks of event comprehension, including\nEvent Segmentation Theory (Zacks et al., 2007), the Event Horizon Model\n(Radvansky & Zacks, 2014), and Hierarchical Generative Framework (Kuperberg,\n2021), which emphasize prediction, causality, and multilevel representations in\nevent understanding.

Key themes that emerge include the use\nof hierarchical structures as inductive biases, the importance of prediction in\ncomprehension, and diverse strategies for learning event dynamics. The review\nidentifies critical areas for future research, including the need for more\nsophisticated approaches to learning structured representations, integrating\nepisodic memory mechanisms, and developing adaptive updating algorithms for\nworking event models.

    "abstract": "Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head and neck (H&N)\ncancers is a time-consuming and experience-demanding task where a large number\nof planning objectives are involved. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has\nrecently been introduced to the planning processes of intensity-modulated\nradiation therapy and brachytherapy for prostate, lung, and cervical cancers.\nHowever, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and\nweighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor\nscalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of\nplanning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic\ntreatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm\nand a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning\nof H&N cancers. Specifically, a set of empirical rules is used to create\nauxiliary planning structures from target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs),\nalong with their associated planning objectives. These planning objectives are\nfed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU)\nvalues. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to\niteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous\naction space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose\ndistribution-based reward function. Proton H&N treatment plans generated by the\nmodel show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when\ncompared with human-generated plans. Moreover, additional experiments on liver\ncancer demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully generalized to\nother treatment sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nDRL-based automatic treatment planning model capable of achieving human-level\nperformance for H&N cancers.",

This is partly due to\nsubject diversity (different body parts, species, genetics, pathologies) and\nalso to the range of modern microscopy imaging techniques resulting in a wide\nvariability of image features (i.e., contrast, resolution). There is a pressing\nneed to make AI accessible to neuroscience researchers to facilitate and\naccelerate their workflow, but publicly available models are scarce and poorly\nmaintained. Our approach is to aggregate data from multiple imaging modalities\n(bright field, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy) and species (mouse,\nrat, rabbit, human), to create an open-source, durable tool for axon and myelin\nsegmentation. Our generalist model makes it easier for researchers to process\ntheir data and can be fine-tuned for better performance on specific domains. We\nstudy the benefits of different aggregation schemes. This multi-domain\nsegmentation model performs better than single-modality dedicated learners\n(p=0.03077), generalizes better on out-of-distribution data and is easier to\nuse and maintain. Importantly, we package the segmentation tool into a\nwell-maintained open-source software ecosystem (see\nhttps://github.com/axondeepseg/axondeepseg).",

Our\nevaluation consists of two experiments: (i) a human study in which 68\nparticipants rated short stories from humans and the SLM on grammaticality,\nrelevance, creativity, and attractiveness, and (ii) a qualitative linguistic\nanalysis examining the textual characteristics of stories produced by each\nmodel. In the first experiment, BART-large outscored average human writers\noverall (2.11 vs. 1.85), a 14% relative improvement, though the slight human\nadvantage in creativity was not statistically significant. In the second\nexperiment, qualitative analysis showed that while GPT-4o demonstrated\nnear-perfect coherence and used less cliche phrases, it tended to produce more\npredictable language, with only 3% of its synopses featuring surprising\nassociations (compared to 15% for BART). These findings highlight how model\nsize and fine-tuning influence the balance between creativity, fluency, and\ncoherence in creative writing tasks, and demonstrate that smaller models can,\nin certain contexts, rival both humans and larger models.",

    "abstract": "Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been proposed for\nhistopathological image analysis over the past years. While they usually\ndemonstrate exceptionally high accuracy, one key question is whether their\nprecision might be affected by low-level image properties not related to\nhistopathology but caused by microscopy image handling and pre-processing. In\nthis paper, we analyze a popular NCT-CRC-HE-100K colorectal cancer dataset used\nin numerous prior works and show that both this dataset and the obtained\nresults may be affected by data-specific biases. The most prominent revealed\ndataset issues are inappropriate color normalization, severe JPEG artifacts\ninconsistent between different classes, and completely corrupted tissue samples\nresulting from incorrect image dynamic range handling. We show that even the\nsimplest model using only 3 features per image (red, green and blue color\nintensities) can demonstrate over 50% accuracy on this 9-class dataset, while\nusing color histogram not explicitly capturing cell morphology features yields\nover 82% accuracy. Moreover, we show that a basic EfficientNet-B0 ImageNet\npretrained model can achieve over 97.7% accuracy on this dataset, outperforming\nall previously proposed solutions developed for this task, including dedicated\nfoundation histopathological models and large cell morphology-aware neural\nnetworks. The NCT-CRC-HE dataset is publicly available and can be freely used\nto replicate the presented results.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent strategies have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the\nreasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning specialized\nroles in the problem-solving process. Concurrently, Tree of Thoughts (ToT)\nmethods have shown potential in improving reasoning for complex\nquestion-answering tasks by exploring diverse reasoning paths. A critical\nlimitation in multi-agent reasoning is the 'Reasoner' agent's shallow\nexploration of reasoning paths. While ToT strategies could help mitigate this\nproblem, they may generate flawed reasoning branches, which could harm the\ntrustworthiness of the final answer. To leverage the strengths of both\nmulti-agent reasoning and ToT strategies, we introduce a novel approach\ncombining ToT-based Reasoner agents with a Thought Validator agent. Multiple\nReasoner agents operate in parallel, employing ToT to explore diverse reasoning\npaths. The Thought Validator then scrutinizes these paths, considering a\nReasoner's conclusion only if its reasoning is valid. This method enables a\nmore robust voting strategy by discarding faulty reasoning paths, enhancing the\nsystem's ability to tackle tasks requiring systematic and trustworthy\nreasoning. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing\ntechniques when evaluated on the GSM8K dataset, outperforming the standard ToT\nstrategy by an average 5.6% across four LLMs. The code and related content can\nbe found in: https://github.com/SecureAIAutonomyLab/MA-ToT",

Despite its broad applications in fields such as\ncomputer vision, graph learning, and natural language processing, the\ndevelopment of a data projection model that can be effectively used to\nvisualize data in the context of FL is crucial yet remains heavily\nunder-explored. Neighbor embedding (NE) is an essential technique for\nvisualizing complex high-dimensional data, but collaboratively learning a joint\nNE model is difficult. The key challenge lies in the objective function, as\neffective visualization algorithms like NE require computing loss functions\namong pairs of data. In this paper, we introduce \\textsc{FedNE}, a novel\napproach that integrates the \\textsc{FedAvg} framework with the contrastive NE\ntechnique, without any requirements of shareable data. To address the lack of\ninter-client repulsion which is crucial for the alignment in the global\nembedding space, we develop a surrogate loss function that each client learns\nand shares with each other. Additionally, we propose a data-mixing strategy to\naugment the local data, aiming to relax the problems of invisible neighbors and\nfalse neighbors constructed by the local $k$NN graphs. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Most of the literature has focused on\nfMRI-to-Image tasks as fMRI is characterized by high spatial resolution.\nHowever, fMRI is an expensive neuroimaging modality and does not allow for\nreal-time BCI. On the other hand, electroencephalography (EEG) is a low-cost,\nnon-invasive, and portable neuroimaging technique, making it an attractive\noption for future real-time applications.

    "abstract": "We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language\nmodels (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks,\nrivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models\n(e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved\ntext-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms\nof model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only\nmultimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g.,\nFlamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose\na novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal\nreasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for\ntile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts\nperformance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training\ndata, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal\npretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that\ndataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during\nthe pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop\nproduction-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel\nin vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only\nperformance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and\nintegrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside\na substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced\nmath and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the\nfield, we release the model weights at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVLM-D-72B\nand will open-source the training code for the community soon.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken\ndialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of\nindependent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition,\ntextual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the\nexperience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of\nseveral seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate\nmodality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such\nas emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they\nrely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account\noverlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these\nindependent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech\ngeneration. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates\nspeech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while\nmodeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams.\nThis allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of\narbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical\nsemantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict\ntime-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this \"Inner\nMonologue\" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated\nspeech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition\nand text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex\nspoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in\npractice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.",

    "abstract": "In an era where vast amounts of data are collected and processed from diverse\nsources, there is a growing demand to develop sophisticated AI systems capable\nof intelligently fusing and analyzing this information. To address these\nchallenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered\nagents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the\nconjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several\nstate-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting\nin a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling\nFramework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that aims to establish a clear foundation for agent\ndevelopment from both functional and software architectural perspectives. Our\nframework distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent,\nsetting LLMs, and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, playing the\nrole of the central coordinator of the agent. This pivotal entity comprises\nfive modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security - the latter\noften neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and\nactive types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various\nmulti-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of\ndistinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our\nframework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby\ndemonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the\noverlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five of our\nproposed architectures through the integration of existing agents into new\nhybrid active/passive core-agents architectures. This analysis provides\ninsights into potential improvements and highlights challenges involved in\ncombining specific agents.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common malignancy amongst women\nworldwide.1 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) serves as the mainstay\ndefinitive treatment regimen for locally advanced cervical cancers and includes\nexternal beam radiation followed by brachytherapy.2 Integral to radiotherapy\ntreatment planning is the routine contouring of both the target tumor at the\nlevel of the cervix, associated gynecologic anatomy and the adjacent organs at\nrisk (OARs). However, manual contouring of these structures is both time and\nlabor intensive and associated with known interobserver variability that can\nimpact treatment outcomes. While multiple tools have been developed to\nautomatically segment OARs and the high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV)\nusing computed tomography (CT) images,3,4,5,6 the development of deep\nlearning-based tumor segmentation tools using routine T2-weighted (T2w)\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) addresses an unmet clinical need to improve\nthe routine contouring of both anatomical structures and cervical cancers,\nthereby increasing quality and consistency of radiotherapy planning. This work\napplied a novel deep-learning model (PocketNet) to segment the cervix, vagina,\nuterus, and tumor(s) on T2w MRI. The performance of the PocketNet architecture\nwas evaluated, when trained on data via five-fold cross validation. PocketNet\nachieved a mean Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficient (DSC) exceeding 70% for\ntumor segmentation and 80% for organ segmentation. Validation on a publicly\navailable dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) demonstrated the\nmodels robustness, achieving DSC scores of 67.3% for tumor segmentation and\n80.8% for organ segmentation. These results suggest that PocketNet is robust to\nvariations in contrast protocols, providing reliable segmentation of the\nregions of interest.",

While existing\nresearch often emphasizes local criteria like instance quality for subset\nselection, we argue that a global approach focused on data diversity is more\ncritical. Our method employs k-means clustering to ensure the selected subset\neffectively represents the full dataset.

Unfortunately, as our empirical results\nshow, this leads to performance degradation that worsens with this frequency.\nSOAP mitigates this degradation by continually updating the running average of\nthe second moment, just as Adam does, but in the current (slowly changing)\ncoordinate basis. Furthermore, since SOAP is equivalent to running Adam in a\nrotated space, it introduces only one additional hyperparameter (the\npreconditioning frequency) compared to Adam. We empirically evaluate SOAP on\nlanguage model pre-training with 360m and 660m sized models. In the large batch\nregime, SOAP reduces the number of iterations by over 40% and wall clock time\nby over 35% compared to AdamW, with approximately 20% improvements in both\nmetrics compared to Shampoo. An implementation of SOAP is available at\nhttps://github.com/nikhilvyas/SOAP.",

Moreover, we\nintroduce a multi-scale decoder to refine the segmentation mask by\nincorporating features from different resolutions in a hierarchical manner.\nAdditionally, our approach integrates global features from intermediate encoder\nstages to improve contextual understanding, while maintaining a lightweight\nstructure to reduce complexity. This balance between performance and efficiency\nenables our method to achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets\nsuch as $PASCAL-5^i$ and $COCO-20^i$ in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings.\nNotably, our model with only 1.5 million parameters demonstrates competitive\nperformance while overcoming limitations of existing methodologies.\nhttps://github.com/amirrezafateh/MSDNet",

    "abstract": "Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously\ncompleting a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human\nproductivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve\nusers' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents\naccidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains\nlargely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by\nconducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in\nadversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for\nattacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing\nusers' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack\nmethod, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious\ncontent designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our\nwork instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments.\nWe collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic\nwebsites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most\ncapable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that\nEIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user\nrequest. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a\ndefensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate.\nNotably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via\nhuman inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between\nsecurity and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA\nseamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further\ndiscuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites\nwithout relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense\nstrategies.",

Most\nresearch on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and\nconcrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination\ndetections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging.\nSome researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated\ntexts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent\nstudies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources\nconduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long\ntexts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually\ncompare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1)\nhardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies\nbetween multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based\ncontext-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns\nknowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge\ntriples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we\nconduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge\ntriples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we\nconstruct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via\nmessage passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge\ntriples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via\nreconstructing the knowledge triples.

On the one hand, some have argued\nthat there is no difference between traditional (pre ML) and ML assisted\nscience. In both cases, theory plays an essential and unavoidable role in the\nanalysis of phenomena and the construction and use of models. Others have\nargued instead that ML methodologies and models are theory independent and, in\nsome cases, even theory free. In this article, we argue that both positions are\noverly simplistic and do not advance our understanding of the interplay between\nML methods and domain theories. Specifically, we provide an analysis of theory\nladenness in ML assisted science.

Our experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed language control model can achieve language expansion by eliminating\nlanguage confusion. In our MuST-C and CoVoST-2 experiments, it shows up to 4.66\nand 4.92 BLEU scores improvement, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate the\nuse of our task arithmetic framework can expand to a language pair where\nneither paired ST training data nor a pre-trained ST model is available.

However, the shared memory and cache in network slicing\nintroduce security vulnerabilities that have yet to be fully addressed. In this\npaper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based side-channel cache attack\nframework specifically designed for network slicing environments. Unlike\ntraditional cache attack methods, our framework leverages reinforcement\nlearning to dynamically identify and exploit cache locations storing sensitive\ninformation, such as authentication keys and user registration data.

By formulating the cache timing channel\nattack as a reinforcement learning-driven guessing game between the attack\nslice and the victim slice, our model efficiently explores possible actions to\npinpoint memory blocks containing sensitive information. Experimental results\nshowcase the superiority of our approach, achieving a success rate of\napproximately 95\\% to 98\\% in accurately identifying the storage locations of\nsensitive data.

    "abstract": "Neural audio codecs have significantly advanced audio compression by\nefficiently converting continuous audio signals into discrete tokens. These\ncodecs preserve high-quality sound and enable sophisticated sound generation\nthrough generative models trained on these tokens. However, existing neural\ncodec models are typically trained on large, undifferentiated audio datasets,\nneglecting the essential discrepancies between sound domains like speech,\nmusic, and environmental sound effects. This oversight complicates data\nmodeling and poses additional challenges to the controllability of sound\ngeneration. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Source-Disentangled Neural\nAudio Codec (SD-Codec), a novel approach that combines audio coding and source\nseparation. By jointly learning audio resynthesis and separation, SD-Codec\nexplicitly assigns audio signals from different domains to distinct codebooks,\nsets of discrete representations. Experimental results indicate that SD-Codec\nnot only maintains competitive resynthesis quality but also, supported by the\nseparation results, demonstrates successful disentanglement of different\nsources in the latent space, thereby enhancing interpretability in audio codec\nand providing potential finer control over the audio generation process.",

It\nstrategically places residual connections between the spike convolution\noperations and the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) nodes, thereby preventing\ndisruptions to the spiking states. Additionally, we introduce a temporal\nencoding block and a temporal decoding block to transform static and dynamic\ndata with timestep $T_S$ into each other, enabling the transmission of data\nwithin the SNN in spike format. Furthermore, we propose LCMT to enable the\nadaptive acquisition of membrane potential thresholds, thereby matching the\nconditions of varying membrane potentials and firing rates across channels and\navoiding the cumbersome process of manually setting and tuning hyperparameters.\nEvaluating the SDP model on seven distinct tasks with SNN timestep $T_S=4$, we\nachieve results comparable to those of the ANN counterparts, along with faster\nconvergence speeds than the baseline SNN method.

    "abstract": "Studying influential nodes (I-nodes) in brain networks is of great\nsignificance in the field of brain imaging. Most existing studies consider\nbrain connectivity hubs as I-nodes. However, this approach relies heavily on\nprior knowledge from graph theory, which may overlook the intrinsic\ncharacteristics of the brain network, especially when its architecture is not\nfully understood. In contrast, self-supervised deep learning can learn\nmeaningful representations directly from the data. This approach enables the\nexploration of I-nodes for brain networks, which is also lacking in current\nstudies. This paper proposes a Self-Supervised Graph Reconstruction framework\nbased on Graph-Transformer (SSGR-GT) to identify I-nodes, which has three main\ncharacteristics. First, as a self-supervised model, SSGR-GT extracts the\nimportance of brain nodes to the reconstruction. Second, SSGR-GT uses\nGraph-Transformer, which is well-suited for extracting features from brain\ngraphs, combining both local and global characteristics. Third, multimodal\nanalysis of I-nodes uses graph-based fusion technology, combining functional\nand structural brain information. The I-nodes we obtained are distributed in\ncritical areas such as the superior frontal lobe, lateral parietal lobe, and\nlateral occipital lobe, with a total of 56 identified across different\nexperiments. These I-nodes are involved in more brain networks than other\nregions, have longer fiber connections, and occupy more central positions in\nstructural connectivity. They also exhibit strong connectivity and high node\nefficiency in both functional and structural networks. Furthermore, there is a\nsignificant overlap between the I-nodes and both the structural and functional\nrich-club. These findings enhance our understanding of the I-nodes within the\nbrain network, and provide new insights for future research in further\nunderstanding the brain working mechanisms.",

While symplectic schemes have been\nused in the literature, they are thus far limited to situations when they\nreduce to explicit algorithms, which include the case of separable Hamiltonians\nor augmented non-separable Hamiltonians.

Various deep neural network architectures\nhave already been inspected for hand gesture recognition systems, including\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent\nneural network (RNN) and a cascade of the last two architectures known as\nCNN-RNN. However, a major problem still exists, which is most of the existing\nML algorithms are designed and developed the building blocks and techniques for\nreal-valued (RV). Researchers applied various RV techniques on the\ncomplex-valued (CV) radar images, such as converting a CV optimisation problem\ninto a RV one, by splitting the complex numbers into their real and imaginary\nparts. However, the major disadvantage of this method is that the resulting\nalgorithm will double the network dimensions. Recent work on RNNs and other\nfundamental theoretical analysis suggest that CV numbers have a richer\nrepresentational capacity, but due to the absence of the building blocks\nrequired to design such models, the performance of CV networks are\nmarginalised. In this report, we propose a fully CV-CNN, including all building\nblocks, forward and backward operations, and derivatives all in complex domain.\nWe explore our proposed classification model on two sets of CV hand gesture\nradar images in comparison with the equivalent RV model. In chapter five, we\npropose a CV-forward residual network, for the purpose of binary classification\nof the two sets of CV hand gesture radar datasets and compare its performance\nwith our proposed CV-CNN and a baseline CV-forward CNN.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have significantly advanced various fields\nby effectively recognizing patterns and solving complex problems. Despite these\nadvancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially\nin applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address\nthis, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet\ninterpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model\npredictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified\nby partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in\nthe literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face\ndifficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial\nmonotonicity. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture, based\non learnable activation functions parametrized as splines, has been proposed as\na more interpretable alternative to MLPs. Building on this, we introduce a\nnovel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture\nand achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability.\nTo achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity\nthrough a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive\nweights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network\npreserves the monotonic relationships between input and output. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MonoKAN not only enhances interpretability but also improves\npredictive performance across the majority of benchmarks, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.",

    "abstract": "This is the 2nd part of the dissertation for my master degree and compared\nthe power consumption using the Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) and parquet\ndataset format with the default floating point (32bit) and Nvidia mixed\nprecision (16bit and 32bit) while training a regression ML model. The same\ncustom PC as per the 1st part, which was dedicated to the classification\ntesting and analysis, was built to perform the experiments, and different ML\nhyper-parameters, such as batch size, neurons, and epochs, were chosen to build\nDeep Neural Networks (DNN). A benchmarking test with default hyper-parameter\nvalues for the DNN was used as a reference, while the experiments used a\ncombination of different settings. The results were recorded in Excel, and\ndescriptive statistics were chosen to calculate the mean between the groups and\ncompare them using graphs and tables. The outcome was positive when using mixed\nprecision combined with specific hyper-parameters. Compared to the\nbenchmarking, optimising the regression models reduced the power consumption\nbetween 7 and 11 Watts. The regression results show that while mixed precision\ncan help improve power consumption, we must carefully consider the\nhyper-parameters. A high number of batch sizes and neurons will negatively\naffect power consumption. However, this research required inferential\nstatistics, specifically ANOVA and T-test, to compare the relationship between\nthe means. The results reported no statistical significance between the means\nin the regression tests and accepted H0. Therefore, choosing different ML\ntechniques and the Parquet dataset format will not improve the computational\npower consumption and the overall ML carbon footprint. However, a more\nextensive implementation with a cluster of GPUs can increase the sample size\nsignificantly, as it is an essential factor and can change the outcome of the\nstatistical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Dense features are important for detecting minute objects in images.\nUnfortunately, despite the remarkable efficacy of the CNN models in multi-scale\nobject detection, CNN models often fail to detect smaller objects in images due\nto the loss of dense features during the pooling process. Atrous convolution\naddresses this issue by applying sparse kernels. However, sparse kernels often\ncan lose the multi-scale detection efficacy of the CNN model.

Further, we apply a depth-wise switchable atrous\nrate to the proposed network, to improve the scale-invariant features. Finally,\nwe apply global context on the proposed model.

Unlike typical prediction methods that rely on RNNs or\nTransformers, this approach can directly handle scenarios where the predicted\nsequence is not adjacent to the input sequence or where its length dynamically\nchanges. In comparison to conventional methods, D2Vformer undoubtedly saves a\nsignificant amount of training resources. In D2Vformer, the Date2Vec module\nuses the timestamp information and feature sequences to generate time position\nembeddings. Afterward, D2Vformer introduces a new fusion block that utilizes an\nattention mechanism to explore the similarity in time positions between the\nembeddings of the input sequence and the predicted sequence, thereby generating\npredictions based on this similarity. Through extensive experiments on six\ndatasets, we demonstrate that Date2Vec outperforms other time position\nembedding methods, and D2Vformer surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both\nfixed-length and variable-length prediction tasks.",

Especially in\nthe labour domain where frequently occupations are inaccurately associated with\nspecific genders, such biases perpetuate traditional gender stereotypes with a\nsignificant impact on society. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring\nequitable and accurate MT systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to\nstudying occupation-related gender bias through the creation of the GOSt-MT\n(Gender and Occupation Statistics for Machine Translation) Knowledge Graph.\nGOSt-MT integrates comprehensive gender statistics from real-world labour data\nand textual corpora used in MT training. This Knowledge Graph allows for a\ndetailed analysis of gender bias across English, French, and Greek,\nfacilitating the identification of persistent stereotypes and areas requiring\nintervention. By providing a structured framework for understanding how\noccupations are gendered in both labour markets and MT systems, GOSt-MT\ncontributes to efforts aimed at making MT systems more equitable and reducing\ngender biases in automated translations.",

Existing IL methods typically\nassume that an incoming task has only increments of classes or domains,\nreferred to as Class IL (CIL) or Domain IL (DIL), respectively. In this work,\nwe consider a more challenging and realistic but under-explored IL scenario,\nnamed Versatile Incremental Learning (VIL), in which a model has no prior of\nwhich of the classes or domains will increase in the next task. In the proposed\nVIL scenario, the model faces intra-class domain confusion and inter-domain\nclass confusion, which makes the model fail to accumulate new knowledge without\ninterference with learned knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a\nsimple yet effective IL framework, named Incremental Classifier with Adaptation\nShift cONtrol (ICON). Based on shifts of learnable modules, we design a novel\nregularization method called Cluster-based Adaptation Shift conTrol (CAST) to\ncontrol the model to avoid confusion with the previously learned knowledge and\nthereby accumulate the new knowledge more effectively. Moreover, we introduce\nan Incremental Classifier (IC) which expands its output nodes to address the\noverwriting issue from different domains corresponding to a single class while\nmaintaining the previous knowledge.

Despite the prevalence of Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers in various domains, applying them to\nbrain networks faces challenges. Specifically, the datasets are severely\nimpacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and\nthe neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of\ndisease-specific patterns.

The prevailing development of quantum computing and machine\nlearning (ML) technologies may bring practical improvement to the performance\nof CHD diagnosis. Quantum machine learning (QML) is receiving tremendous\ninterest in various disciplines due to its higher performance and capabilities.\nA quantum leap in the healthcare industry will increase processing power and\noptimise multiple models. Techniques for QML have the potential to forecast\ncardiac disease and help in early detection.

Our approach, with its\nunique ability to address multidimensional healthcare data, reassures the\nmethod's robustness by fusing quantum and classical ML algorithms in a\nmulti-step inferential framework.

In this\nresearch, a hybrid approach utilizes techniques with quantum computing\ncapabilities to tackle complex problems that are not amenable to conventional\nmachine learning algorithms and to minimize computational expenses. The\nproposed method has been developed in the Raspberry Pi 5 Graphics Processing\nUnit (GPU) platform and tested on a broad dataset that integrates clinical and\nimaging data from patients suffering from CHD and healthy controls.

Take video question answering (VideoQA)\ntasks as an example, human annotated questions and answers often cover only\npart of the video, since the corresponding text is often short and monotonous,\nleading to underutilization of video. To address this, we propose a\nBootstrapping Video-Language Alignment framework (BoViLA), a self-training\nmethod that augments question samples during training process through LLM-based\nself-questioning and answering, which help model exploit video information and\nthe internal knowledge of LLMs more thoroughly to improve modality alignment.\nHowever, low-quality self-generated questions may instead contaminate the\nperformance, especially in the early stages of training, as we have observed in\nour experiments. To filter bad self-generated questions, we introduce\nEvidential Deep Learning (EDL) to estimate uncertainty and assess the quality\nof self-generated questions by evaluating the modality alignment within the\ncontext. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore\nLLM-based self-training frameworks for modality alignment. We evaluate BoViLA\non five strong VideoQA benchmarks, where it outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness and generality.\nAdditionally, we provide extensive analyses of the self-training framework and\nthe EDL-based uncertainty filtering mechanism.

In this paper, contrary\nto the existing methods, we present a novel and computationally efficient ISR\nalgorithm that is independent of the image dataset to learn the ISR task. The\nproposed algorithm reformulates the ISR task from generating the Super-Resolved\n(SR) images to computing the inverse of the kernels that span the degradation\nspace. We introduce Deep Identity Learning, exploiting the identity relation\nbetween the degradation and inverse degradation models. The proposed approach\nneither relies on the ISR dataset nor on a single input low-resolution (LR)\nimage (like the self-supervised method i.e. ZSSR) to model the ISR task.

Users can interact with VR apps\nthrough interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional\n(3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is\ninstrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks,\nincluding automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE\ndetection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object\ndetection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually\nwith a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and\nspinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in VR apps,\ndue to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by\nopen-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of\ncontext-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial\nperception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results.\nThus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to VR apps. In\nthis paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI\nElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By\nimitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic\ncontexts of VR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection\nprocess is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop.\nSpecifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic\ncontext comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3)\nContext-sensitive interactability classification.

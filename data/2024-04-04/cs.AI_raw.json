Our key\ncontribution is a learnable feature map $\\Phi$ which transforms the Hopfield\nenergy function into kernel space. This transformation ensures convergence\nbetween the local minima of energy and the fixed points of retrieval dynamics\nwithin the kernel space. Consequently, the kernel norm induced by $\\Phi$ serves\nas a novel similarity measure. It utilizes the stored memory patterns as\nlearning data to enhance memory capacity across all modern Hopfield models.\nSpecifically, we accomplish this by constructing a separation loss\n$\\mathcal{L}_\\Phi$ that separates the local minima of kernelized energy by\nseparating stored memory patterns in kernel space.

    "abstract": "The increasing relevance of panoptic segmentation is tied to the advancements\nin autonomous driving and AR/VR applications. However, the deployment of such\nmodels has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation,\ngiving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in\npanoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an\nunlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance\nsegmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress\nhas been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of\nsemantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level\nadaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix\nsignificantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation\nperformance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted\ninstances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the\nexhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected\nconfirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of\ndegraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To\nmitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based\ndomain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language\nprompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two\nmechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular\npanoptic UDA benchmarks.",

To enable the solver to search possibly\n\"distant\" parts of the assignment tree, we study the effect of resets, a\nvariant of restarts which not only erases the assignment trail, but also\nrandomizes the activity scores of the variables of the input formula after\nreset, thus potentially enabling a better global exploration of the search\nspace.\n  In this paper, we model the problem of whether to trigger reset as a\nmulti-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose two reinforcement learning (RL)\nbased adaptive reset policies using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and\nThompson sampling algorithms. These two algorithms balance the\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff by adaptively choosing arms (reset vs. no\nreset) based on their estimated rewards during the solver's run. We implement\nour reset policies in four baseline SOTA CDCL solvers and compare the baselines\nagainst the reset versions on Satcoin benchmarks and SAT Competition instances.\nOur results show that RL-based reset versions outperform the corresponding\nbaseline solvers on both Satcoin and the SAT competition instances, suggesting\nthat our RL policy helps to dynamically and profitably adapt the reset\nfrequency for any given input instance. We also introduce the concept of a\npartial reset, where at least a constant number of variable activities are\nretained across reset boundaries. Building on previous results, we show that\nthere is an exponential separation between O(1) vs. $\\Omega(n)$-length partial\nresets.",

Given the potential risks\nassociated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This\nresearch aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by\nsystematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor\nhallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning\n(i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants\n(N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content\n(e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format.

    "abstract": "This paper studies post-training large language models (LLMs) using\npreference feedback from a powerful oracle to help a model iteratively improve\nover itself. The typical approach for post-training LLMs involves Reinforcement\nLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which traditionally separates reward\nlearning and subsequent policy optimization. However, such a reward\nmaximization approach is limited by the nature of \"point-wise\" rewards (such as\nBradley-Terry model), which fails to express complex intransitive or cyclic\npreference relations. While advances on RLHF show reward learning and policy\noptimization can be merged into a single contrastive objective for stability,\nthey yet still remain tethered to the reward maximization framework. Recently,\na new wave of research sidesteps the reward maximization presumptions in favor\nof directly optimizing over \"pair-wise\" or general preferences. In this paper,\nwe introduce Direct Nash Optimization (DNO), a provable and scalable algorithm\nthat marries the simplicity and stability of contrastive learning with\ntheoretical generality from optimizing general preferences. Because DNO is a\nbatched on-policy algorithm using a regression-based objective, its\nimplementation is straightforward and efficient. Moreover, DNO enjoys monotonic\nimprovement across iterations that help it improve even over a strong teacher\n(such as GPT-4). In our experiments, a resulting 7B parameter Orca-2.5 model\naligned by DNO achieves the state-of-the-art win-rate against GPT-4-Turbo of\n33% on AlpacaEval 2.0 (even after controlling for response length), an absolute\ngain of 26% (7% to 33%) over the initializing model. It outperforms models with\nfar more parameters, including Mistral Large, Self-Rewarding LM (70B\nparameters), and older versions of GPT-4.",

We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous\nmodalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions.\nTo test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting\na dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption\ndescribing the scene.

To \"select\" a specific reconstruction or depth\nmap, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from\nthe latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the\noutput depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and\nimage branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard\ndeviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in\nthe other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we\ndirectly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler.

Using factual and common-sense claims from two claim\nverification datasets, we showcase interpretability analyses at local and\nglobal levels. The local analysis highlights entity centrality in LLM\nreasoning, from claim-related information and multi-hop reasoning to\nrepresentation errors causing erroneous evaluation. On the other hand, the\nglobal reveals trends in the underlying evolution, such as word-based knowledge\nevolving into claim-related facts.

    "abstract": "Requirements elicitation, a critical, yet time-consuming and challenging step\nin product development, often fails to capture the full spectrum of user needs.\nThis may lead to products that fall short of expectations. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautomate and enhance the requirements elicitation process. LLMs are used to\ngenerate a vast array of simulated users (LLM agents), enabling the exploration\nof a much broader range of user needs and unforeseen use cases. These agents\nengage in product experience scenarios, through explaining their actions,\nobservations, and challenges. Subsequent agent interviews and analysis uncover\nvaluable user needs, including latent ones. We validate our framework with\nthree experiments. First, we explore different methodologies for diverse agent\ngeneration, discussing their advantages and shortcomings. We measure the\ndiversity of identified user needs and demonstrate that context-aware agent\ngeneration leads to greater diversity. Second, we show how our framework\neffectively mimics empathic lead user interviews, identifying a greater number\nof latent needs than conventional human interviews. Third, we showcase that\nLLMs can be used to analyze interviews, capture needs, and classify them as\nlatent or not. Our work highlights the potential of using LLM agents to\naccelerate early-stage product development, reduce costs, and increase\ninnovation.",

    "abstract": "The classification of insect pests is a critical task in agricultural\ntechnology, vital for ensuring food security and environmental sustainability.\nHowever, the complexity of pest identification, due to factors like high\ncamouflage and species diversity, poses significant obstacles. Existing methods\nstruggle with the fine-grained feature extraction needed to distinguish between\nclosely related pest species. Although recent advancements have utilized\nmodified network structures and combined deep learning approaches to improve\naccuracy, challenges persist due to the similarity between pests and their\nsurroundings. To address this problem, we introduce InsectMamba, a novel\napproach that integrates State Space Models (SSMs), Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism (MSA), and Multilayer\nPerceptrons (MLPs) within Mix-SSM blocks. This integration facilitates the\nextraction of comprehensive visual features by leveraging the strengths of each\nencoding strategy. A selective module is also proposed to adaptively aggregate\nthese features, enhancing the model's ability to discern pest characteristics.\nInsectMamba was evaluated against strong competitors across five insect pest\nclassification datasets. The results demonstrate its superior performance and\nverify the significance of each model component by an ablation study.",

Comparative\nanalyses reveal SMATE's superior performance over TapNet and HMM, while XCM\nexcels in supervised scenarios with an accuracy range of 92 - 94%.

We identify conditions under which\nAI, by reducing the cost of access to certain modes of knowledge, can\nparadoxically harm public understanding. While large language models are\ntrained on vast amounts of diverse data, they naturally generate output towards\nthe 'center' of the distribution. This is generally useful, but widespread\nreliance on recursive AI systems could lead to a process we define as\n\"knowledge collapse\", and argue this could harm innovation and the richness of\nhuman understanding and culture. However, unlike AI models that cannot choose\nwhat data they are trained on, humans may strategically seek out diverse forms\nof knowledge if they perceive them to be worthwhile. To investigate this, we\nprovide a simple model in which a community of learners or innovators choose to\nuse traditional methods or to rely on a discounted AI-assisted process and\nidentify conditions under which knowledge collapse occurs. In our default\nmodel, a 20% discount on AI-generated content generates public beliefs 2.3\ntimes further from the truth than when there is no discount.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence applications gradually move outside the safe walls of\nresearch labs and invade our daily lives. This is also true for Machine\nLearning methods on Knowledge Graphs, which has led to a steady increase in\ntheir application since the beginning of the 21st century. However, in many\napplications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligences\ndecision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial\nIntelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible\nArtificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e.\nknowledge, in a human- as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a\nshort history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs.\nFurthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial\nIntelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning.\nBy introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we\nprovide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their\nsimilarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible\nArtificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine\nLearning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on\nKnowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for\nComprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. In addition, a\ncomprehensive overview of the research on Comprehensible Artificial\nIntelligence on Knowledge Graphs is presented and put into the context of the\ntaxonomy. Finally, research gaps in the field of Comprehensible Artificial\nIntelligence on Knowledge Graphs are identified for future research.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human\nmobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image\nclassification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low\npower/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life.\nThese requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus\non proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not\nsystematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning\nevent-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to\neffectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel\nmethodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters\nconsidering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for\nenhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of\nSNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size,\nlearning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the\naccuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN\naccuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our\nmethodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the\nstate-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS\ndataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard\ndeviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this\nmanner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter\nenhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD\nsystems.",

However, they are still plagued by the\nhallucination problem, causing unpredictable factual errors in the generated\nresponses. Recently, knowledge-grounded dialogue generation models, that\nintentionally invoke external knowledge resources to more informative\nresponses, are also proven to be effective in reducing hallucination. Following\nthe idea of getting high-quality knowledge, a few efforts have achieved pretty\ngood performance on this issue. As some inevitable knowledge noises may also\nlead to hallucinations, it is emergent to investigate the reason and future\ndirections for building noise-tolerant methods in KGD tasks. In this paper, we\nanalyze the causal story behind this problem with counterfactual reasoning\nmethods. Based on the causal effect analysis, we propose a possible solution\nfor alleviating the hallucination in KGD by exploiting the dialogue-knowledge\ninteraction. Experimental results of our example implementation show that this\nmethod can reduce hallucination without disrupting other dialogue performance,\nwhile keeping adaptive to different generation models.

However, both\narchitectures have inherent shortcomings: CNN are constrained by a limited\nreceptive field that may hinder their ability to capture broader spatial\ncontexts, while Transformers are computationally intensive, making them costly\nto train and deploy on large datasets. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based\non state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural\nlanguage processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the\nshortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the\nfirst time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks.\nWe tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and\nMambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD),\nand building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt\nthe cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full\nlearning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For\nthe change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose\nthree spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally\ncombined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve\nspatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining\naccurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed\nframeworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without\nusing any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the\npotential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Further experiments show that\nour architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be\navailable in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD",

Building on earlier approaches that use self-consistency\nas a more reliable measure of model confidence, we propose using the LLM itself\nto self-evaluate the similarity between each of its sampled responses for a\ngiven query. We then further leverage conformal prediction techniques to\ndevelop an abstention procedure that benefits from rigorous theoretical\nguarantees on the hallucination rate (error rate). Experimentally, our\nresulting conformal abstention method reliably bounds the hallucination rate on\nvarious closed-book, open-domain generative question answering datasets, while\nalso maintaining a significantly less conservative abstention rate on a dataset\nwith long responses (Temporal Sequences) compared to baselines using\nlog-probability scores to quantify uncertainty, while achieveing comparable\nperformance on a dataset with short answers (TriviaQA). To evaluate the\nexperiments automatically, one needs to determine if two responses are\nequivalent given a question.

    "abstract": "To enhance the interpretability of Reinforcement Learning (RL), we propose\nRevealing Evolutionary Action Consequence Trajectories (REACT). In contrast to\nthe prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior\nlearned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case\ntrajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent\nbehavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial\nstate, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse\npopulation of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT\nincorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global\ndiversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments\nwith policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous\nenvironments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results\nhighlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior\nbeyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in\nthe IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction\ndata to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically\nunbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity\nestimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated\nvia simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely-available,\nlarge-scale, real click logs. However, the mainstream simulation-based\nexperiments are somewhat limited as they often feature a single, deterministic\nproduction ranker and simplified user simulation models to generate the\nsynthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and\ndiverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation.\n  To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness\nof existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive\nsimulation-based experiments that (1) use both deterministic and stochastic\nproduction rankers, each with different ranking performance, and (2) leverage\nmultiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions. We\nfind that the DLA models and IPS-DCM show better robustness under various\nsimulation settings than IPS-PBM and PRS with offline propensity estimation.\nBesides, the existing CLTR models often fail to outperform the naive click\nbaselines when the production ranker has relatively high ranking performance or\ncertain randomness, which suggests an urgent need for developing new CLTR\nalgorithms that work for these settings.",

In parallel, explainable AI (XAI) continues to evolve,\naddressing the necessity for transparency and trustworthiness in ML models. XAI\ntechniques aim to enhance the transparency of ML models by providing insights,\nin terms of model's explanations, into their decision-making process.\nSimultaneously, some MLaaS platforms now offer explanations alongside the ML\nprediction outputs. This setup has elevated concerns regarding vulnerabilities\nin MLaaS, particularly in relation to privacy leakage attacks such as model\nextraction attacks (MEA). This is due to the fact that explanations can unveil\ninsights about the inner workings of the model which could be exploited by\nmalicious users. In this work, we focus on investigating how model\nexplanations, particularly counterfactual explanations (CFs), can be exploited\nfor performing MEA within the MLaaS platform. We also delve into assessing the\neffectiveness of incorporating differential privacy (DP) as a mitigation\nstrategy. To this end, we first propose a novel approach for MEA based on\nKnowledge Distillation (KD) to enhance the efficiency of extracting a\nsubstitute model of a target model exploiting CFs, without any knowledge about\nthe training data distribution by the attacker. Then, we advise an approach for\ntraining CF generators incorporating DP to generate private CFs. We conduct\nthorough experimental evaluations on real-world datasets and demonstrate that\nour proposed KD-based MEA can yield a high-fidelity substitute model with a\nreduced number of queries with respect to baseline approaches. Furthermore, our\nfindings reveal that including a privacy layer can allow mitigating the MEA.\nHowever, on the account of the quality of CFs, impacts the performance of the\nexplanations.",

    "abstract": "Foundation model, which is pre-trained on broad data and is able to adapt to\na wide range of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It promotes the development of\nhealthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models, breaking the contradiction\nbetween limited AI models and diverse healthcare practices. Much more\nwidespread healthcare scenarios will benefit from the development of a\nhealthcare foundation model (HFM), improving their advanced intelligent\nhealthcare services. Despite the impending widespread deployment of HFMs, there\nis currently a lack of clear understanding about how they work in the\nhealthcare field, their current challenges, and where they are headed in the\nfuture. To answer these questions, a comprehensive and deep survey of the\nchallenges, opportunities, and future directions of HFMs is presented in this\nsurvey. It first conducted a comprehensive overview of the HFM including the\nmethods, data, and applications for a quick grasp of the current progress.\nThen, it made an in-depth exploration of the challenges present in data,\nalgorithms, and computing infrastructures for constructing and widespread\napplication of foundation models in healthcare. This survey also identifies\nemerging and promising directions in this field for future development. We\nbelieve that this survey will enhance the community's comprehension of the\ncurrent progress of HFM and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future\ndevelopment in this field.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose that small models may not need to absorb the cost\nof pre-training to reap its benefits. Instead, they can capitalize on the\nastonishing results achieved by modern, enormous models to a surprising degree.\nWe observe that, when distilled on a task from a pre-trained teacher model, a\nsmall model can achieve or surpass the performance it would achieve if it was\npre-trained then finetuned on that task. To allow this phenomenon to be easily\nleveraged, we establish a connection reducing knowledge distillation to modern\ncontrastive learning, opening two doors: (1) vastly different model\narchitecture pairings can work for the distillation, and (2) most contrastive\nlearning algorithms rooted in the theory of Noise Contrastive Estimation can be\neasily applied and used. We demonstrate this paradigm using pre-trained teacher\nmodels from open-source model hubs, Transformer and convolution based model\ncombinations, and a novel distillation algorithm that massages the\nAlignment/Uniformity perspective of contrastive learning by Wang & Isola (2020)\ninto a distillation objective. We choose this flavor of contrastive learning\ndue to its low computational cost, an overarching theme of this work. We also\nobserve that this phenomenon tends not to occur if the task is data-limited.\nHowever, this can be alleviated by leveraging yet another scale-inspired\ndevelopment: large, pre-trained generative models for dataset augmentation.\nAgain, we use an open-source model, and our rudimentary prompts are sufficient\nto boost the small model`s performance. Thus, we highlight a training method\nfor small models that is up to 94% faster than the standard pre-training\nparadigm without sacrificing performance. For practitioners discouraged from\nfully utilizing modern foundation datasets for their small models due to the\nprohibitive scale, we believe our work keeps that door open.",

While previous work based on large language models (LLMs) shows\nimpressive performance on zero-shot TTS, such methods often suffer from poor\nrobustness, such as unstable prosody (weird pitch and rhythm/duration) and a\nhigh word error rate (WER), due to the autoregressive prediction style of\nlanguage models. The core idea behind RALL-E is chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting, which decomposes the task into simpler steps to enhance the\nrobustness of LLM-based TTS. To accomplish this idea, RALL-E first predicts\nprosody features (pitch and duration) of the input text and uses them as\nintermediate conditions to predict speech tokens in a CoT style. Second, RALL-E\nutilizes the predicted duration prompt to guide the computing of self-attention\nweights in Transformer to enforce the model to focus on the corresponding\nphonemes and prosody features when predicting speech tokens. Results of\ncomprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that, compared\nto a powerful baseline method VALL-E, RALL-E significantly improves the WER of\nzero-shot TTS from $5.6\\%$ (without reranking) and $1.7\\%$ (with reranking) to\n$2.5\\%$ and $1.0\\%$, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RALL-E\ncorrectly synthesizes sentences that are hard for VALL-E and reduces the error\nrate from $68\\%$ to $4\\%$.",

Our\nextensive experiments on four commonly used datasets and a number of\nstate-of-the-art KG-based RSs reveal that: to remove, randomly distort or\ndecrease knowledge does not necessarily decrease recommendation accuracy, even\nfor cold-start users. These findings inspire us to rethink how to better\nutilize knowledge from existing KGs, whereby we discuss and provide insights\ninto what characteristics of datasets and KG-based RSs may help improve KG\nutilization efficiency.

    "abstract": "Language Models (LMs) have shown promising performance in natural language\ngeneration. However, as LMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated responses,\nit is crucial to correctly quantify their uncertainty in responding to given\ninputs. In addition to verbalized confidence elicited via prompting, many\nuncertainty measures ($e.g.$, semantic entropy and affinity-graph-based\nmeasures) have been proposed. However, these measures can differ greatly, and\nit is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over\ndifferent ranges ($e.g.$, $[0,\\infty)$ or $[0,1]$). In this work, we address\nthis issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed\n$Rank$-$Calibration$, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs.\nOur key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply\nlower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations\nfrom this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc\nbinary thresholding of the correctness score ($e.g.$, ROUGE or METEOR). The\nbroad applicability and the granular interpretability of our methods are\ndemonstrated empirically.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the prevalence\nof iterative interactions among these models is anticipated to increase.\nNotably, recent advancements in multi-round self-improving methods allow LLMs\nto generate new examples for training subsequent models. At the same time,\nmulti-agent LLM systems, involving automated interactions among agents, are\nalso increasing in prominence. Thus, in both short and long terms, LLMs may\nactively engage in an evolutionary process. We draw parallels between the\nbehavior of LLMs and the evolution of human culture, as the latter has been\nextensively studied by cognitive scientists for decades. Our approach involves\nleveraging Iterated Learning (IL), a Bayesian framework that elucidates how\nsubtle biases are magnified during human cultural evolution, to explain some\nbehaviors of LLMs. This paper outlines key characteristics of agents' behavior\nin the Bayesian-IL framework, including predictions that are supported by\nexperimental verification with various LLMs. This theoretical framework could\nhelp to more effectively predict and guide the evolution of LLMs in desired\ndirections.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of deep learning techniques has advanced the image segmentation\ntask, especially for medical images. Many neural network models have been\nintroduced in the last decade bringing the automated segmentation accuracy\nclose to manual segmentation. However, cutting-edge models like\nTransformer-based architectures rely on large scale annotated training data,\nand are generally designed with densely consecutive layers in the encoder,\ndecoder, and skip connections resulting in large number of parameters.\nAdditionally, for better performance, they often be pretrained on a larger\ndata, thus requiring large memory size and increasing resource expenses. In\nthis study, we propose a new lightweight but efficient model, namely LiteNeXt,\nbased on convolutions and mixing modules with simplified decoder, for medical\nimage segmentation. The model is trained from scratch with small amount of\nparameters (0.71M) and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (0.42). To\nhandle boundary fuzzy as well as occlusion or clutter in objects especially in\nmedical image regions, we propose the Marginal Weight Loss that can help\neffectively determine the marginal boundary between object and background.\nAdditionally, the Self-embedding Representation Parallel technique is proposed\nas an innovative data augmentation strategy that utilizes the network\narchitecture itself for self-learning augmentation, enhancing feature\nextraction robustness without external data. Experiments on public datasets\nincluding Data Science Bowls, GlaS, ISIC2018, PH2, Sunnybrook, and Lung X-ray\ndata show promising results compared to other state-of-the-art CNN-based and\nTransformer-based architectures.

In our tests, the pruned\nmodel outperforms the original model by a large margin, while only requiring\nminimal computation to prune the weight matrices. In the case of a small\nsynthetic task in integer multiplication, the Phi-2 model can improve its\naccuracy in the test set from 13.75% to 97.50%.

This new language encapsulates many seemingly\ndistinct prior methods under the same framework, and allows us to reason about\nguidance, a previously obscured core contribution of different algorithms. We\nsuggest an information theoretic method to evaluate guidance, which\nexperimentally matches intuition when tested on known algorithms in a variety\nof environments. The language and evaluation of guidance suggests improvements\nto existing methods, and allows for simple hybrid algorithms that combine\nguidance from multiple sources.",

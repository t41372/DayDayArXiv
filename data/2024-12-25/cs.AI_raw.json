    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) poses significant\nchallenges for edge inference deployment due to resource and power constraints\nof edge devices. Recent works on unary-based matrix multiplication hardware aim\nto leverage data sparsity and low-precision values to enhance hardware\nefficiency. However, the adoption and integration of such unary hardware into\ncommercial deep learning accelerators (DLA) remain limited due to processing\nelement (PE) array dataflow differences. This work presents Tempus Core, a\nconvolution core with highly scalable unary-based PE array comprising of tub\n(temporal-unary-binary) multipliers that seamlessly integrates with the NVDLA\n(NVIDIA's open-source DLA for accelerating CNNs) while maintaining dataflow\ncompliance and boosting hardware efficiency. Analysis across various datapath\ngranularities shows that for INT8 precision in 45nm CMOS, Tempus Core's PE cell\nunit (PCU) yields 59.3% and 15.3% reductions in area and power consumption,\nrespectively, over NVDLA's CMAC unit. Considering a 16x16 PE array in Tempus\nCore, area and power improves by 75% and 62%, respectively, while delivering 5x\nand 4x iso-area throughput improvements for INT8 and INT4 precisions.\nPost-place and route analysis of Tempus Core's PCU shows that the 16x4 PE array\nfor INT4 precision in 45nm CMOS requires only 0.017 mm^2 die area and consumes\nonly 6.2mW of total power. We demonstrate that area-power efficient unary-based\nhardware can be seamlessly integrated into conventional DLAs, paving the path\nfor efficient unary hardware for edge AI inference.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of natural language processing (NLP) and pre-trained\nlanguage models have enabled accurate text classification in a variety of\nsettings. However, text classification models are susceptible to backdoor\nattacks, where an attacker embeds a trigger into the victim model to make the\nmodel predict attacker-desired labels in targeted scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose to utilize backdoor attacks for a new purpose: bias injection. We\ndevelop a backdoor attack in which a subset of the training dataset is poisoned\nto associate strong male actors with negative sentiment. We execute our attack\non two popular text classification datasets (IMDb and SST) and seven different\nmodels ranging from traditional Doc2Vec-based models to LSTM networks and\nmodern transformer-based BERT and RoBERTa models. Our results show that the\nreduction in backdoored models' benign classification accuracy is limited,\nimplying that our attacks remain stealthy, whereas the models successfully\nlearn to associate strong male actors with negative sentiment (100% attack\nsuccess rate with >= 3% poison rate). Attacks on BERT and RoBERTa are\nparticularly more stealthy and effective, demonstrating an increased risk of\nusing modern and larger models. We also measure the generalizability of our\nbias injection by proposing two metrics: (i) U-BBSR which uses previously\nunseen words when measuring attack success, and (ii) P-BBSR which measures\nattack success using paraphrased test samples. U-BBSR and P-BBSR results show\nthat the bias injected by our attack can go beyond memorizing a trigger phrase.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and\nvideo generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an\neffective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed\nto cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next\ntimesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However,\non the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous\ntimesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand,\nconservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but\nstill computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation\nquality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a\ntradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper\nbegins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features.\nSurprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly\nmore caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching\ncan fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual\ncaching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively,\nleading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same\ntime. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise\nconservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no\ntraining and calibration data.\n  Our codes have been released in Github: \\textbf{Code:\n\\href{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}{\\texttt{\\textcolor{cyan}{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}}}}",

These challenges are heightened in multi-object environments due to\nthe combinatorial complexity of the state space as well as of the desired\nbehaviors. While recent approaches have utilized large-scale offline data to\ntrain models from pixel observations, achieving performance gains through\nscaling, these methods struggle with compositional generalization in unseen\nobject configurations with constrained network and dataset sizes. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel behavioral cloning (BC) approach that\nleverages object-centric representations and an entity-centric Transformer with\ndiffusion-based optimization, enabling efficient learning from offline image\ndata. Our method first decomposes observations into an object-centric\nrepresentation, which is then processed by our entity-centric Transformer that\ncomputes attention at the object level, simultaneously predicting object\ndynamics and the agent's actions. Combined with the ability of diffusion models\nto capture multi-modal behavior distributions, this results in substantial\nperformance improvements in multi-object tasks and, more importantly, enables\ncompositional generalization.

This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by\nadverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them,\nlargely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this\nchallenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing\nclear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions.\nSpecifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the\ndense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in\nwhich the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the\nlatter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we\npropose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the\ndense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the\nrelatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally,\nwe train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for\nexcluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by\nGaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to\nfacilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS\nconsistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather\nscenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Given a graph pair $(G^1, G^2)$, graph edit distance (GED) is defined as the\nminimum number of edit operations converting $G^1$ to $G^2$. GED is a\nfundamental operation widely used in many applications, but its exact\ncomputation is NP-hard, so the approximation of GED has gained a lot of\nattention. Data-driven learning-based methods have been found to provide\nsuperior results compared to classical approximate algorithms, but they\ndirectly fit the coupling relationship between a pair of vertices from their\nvertex features. We argue that while pairwise vertex features can capture the\ncoupling cost (discrepancy) of a pair of vertices, the vertex coupling matrix\nshould be derived from the vertex-pair cost matrix through a more\nwell-established method that is aware of the global context of the graph pair,\nsuch as optimal transport. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach that\nintegrates a supervised learning-based method and an unsupervised method, both\nbased on optimal transport. Our learning method, GEDIOT, is based on inverse\noptimal transport that leverages a learnable Sinkhorn algorithm to generate the\ncoupling matrix.

    "abstract": "The idea of disentangled representations is to reduce the data to a set of\ngenerative factors that produce it. Typically, such representations are vectors\nin latent space, where each coordinate corresponds to one of the generative\nfactors. The object can then be modified by changing the value of a particular\ncoordinate, but it is necessary to determine which coordinate corresponds to\nthe desired generative factor -- a difficult task if the vector representation\nhas a high dimension. In this article, we propose ArSyD (Architecture for\nSymbolic Disentanglement), which represents each generative factor as a vector\nof the same dimension as the resulting representation. In ArSyD, the object\nrepresentation is obtained as a superposition of the generative factor vector\nrepresentations. We call such a representation a \\textit{symbolic disentangled\nrepresentation}. We use the principles of Hyperdimensional Computing (also\nknown as Vector Symbolic Architectures), where symbols are represented as\nhypervectors, allowing vector operations on them. Disentanglement is achieved\nby construction, no additional assumptions about the underlying distributions\nare made during training, and the model is only trained to reconstruct images\nin a weakly supervised manner. We study ArSyD on the dSprites and CLEVR\ndatasets and provide a comprehensive analysis of the learned symbolic\ndisentangled representations. We also propose new disentanglement metrics that\nallow comparison of methods using latent representations of different\ndimensions. ArSyD allows to edit the object properties in a controlled and\ninterpretable way, and the dimensionality of the object property representation\ncoincides with the dimensionality of the object representation itself.",

    "abstract": "Transformer neural operators have recently become an effective approach for\nsurrogate modeling of systems governed by partial differential equations\n(PDEs). In this paper, we introduce a modified implicit factorized transformer\n(IFactFormer-m) model which replaces the original chained factorized attention\nwith parallel factorized attention. The IFactFormer-m model successfully\nperforms long-term predictions for turbulent channel flow, whereas the original\nIFactFormer (IFactFormer-o), Fourier neural operator (FNO), and implicit\nFourier neural operator (IFNO) exhibit a poor performance. Turbulent channel\nflows are simulated by direct numerical simulation using fine grids at friction\nReynolds numbers $\\text{Re}_{\\tau}\\approx 180,395,590$, and filtered to coarse\ngrids for training neural operator. The neural operator takes the current flow\nfield as input and predicts the flow field at the next time step, and long-term\nprediction is achieved in the posterior through an autoregressive approach. The\nresults show that IFactFormer-m, compared to other neural operators and the\ntraditional large eddy simulation (LES) methods including dynamic Smagorinsky\nmodel (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model, reduces\nprediction errors in the short term, and achieves stable and accurate long-term\nprediction of various statistical properties and flow structures, including the\nenergy spectrum, mean streamwise velocity, root mean square (rms) values of\nfluctuating velocities, Reynolds shear stress, and spatial structures of\ninstantaneous velocity. Moreover, the trained IFactFormer-m is much faster than\ntraditional LES methods. By analyzing the attention kernels, we elucidate the\nreasons why IFactFormer-m converges faster and achieves a stable and accurate\nlong-term prediction compared to IFactFormer-o.

ViTs show strong capability for image understanding tasks such as\nobject detection, segmentation, and classification. This is due in part to\ntheir ability to leverage global information from interactions among visual\ntokens. However, the self-attention mechanism in ViTs are limited because they\ndo not allow visual tokens to exchange local or global information with\nneighboring features before computing global attention. This is problematic\nbecause tokens are treated in isolation when attending (matching) to other\ntokens, and valuable spatial relationships are overlooked. This isolation is\nfurther compounded by dot-product similarity operations that make tokens from\ndifferent semantic classes appear visually similar. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce two modifications to the traditional self-attention\nframework; a novel aggressive convolution pooling strategy for local feature\nmixing, and a new conceptual attention transformation to facilitate interaction\nand feature exchange between semantic concepts. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that local and global information exchange among visual features\nbefore self-attention significantly improves performance on challenging object\ndetection tasks and generalizes across multiple benchmark datasets and\nchallenging medical datasets.

I combine Helmholtz's \"Perception as Unconscious Inference\" --\nparalleled by modern generative models like variational autoencoders (VAE) --\nwith the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. This combination leads to\nthe development of a hierarchical VAE model, which I test for its ability to\nmimic neurons from the primate visual cortex in response to motion stimuli.\nResults show that the hierarchical VAE perceives motion similar to the primate\nbrain. Additionally, the model identifies causal factors of retinal motion\ninputs, such as object- and self-motion, in a completely unsupervised manner.\nCollectively, these results suggest that hierarchical inference underlines the\nbrain's understanding of the world, and hierarchical VAEs can effectively model\nthis understanding.\n  Project #2 (Chapter 5) investigates the spatiotemporal structure of\nspontaneous brain activity and its reflection of brain states like rest. Using\nsimultaneous fMRI and wide-field Ca2+ imaging data, this project demonstrates\nthat the mouse cortex can be decomposed into overlapping communities, with\naround half of the cortical regions belonging to multiple communities.\nComparisons reveal similarities and differences between networks inferred from\nfMRI and Ca2+ signals.\n  The introduction (Chapter 1) is divided similarly to this abstract: sections\n1.1 to 1.8 provide background information about Project #1, and sections 1.9 to\n1.13 are related to Project #2.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in software\nengineering tasks such as Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair\n(APR). This study investigates how input order and context size influence LLM\nperformance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering\ntasks. We evaluate different method orderings using Kendall Tau distances,\nincluding \"perfect\" (where ground truths appear first) and \"worst\" (where\nground truths appear last), across two benchmarks containing Java and Python\nprojects. Our results reveal a strong order bias: in Java projects, Top-1 FL\naccuracy drops from 57% to 20% when reversing the order, while in Python\nprojects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3%. However, segmenting inputs\ninto smaller contexts mitigates this bias, reducing the performance gap in FL\nfrom 22% and 6% to just 1% across both benchmarks. We replaced method names\nwith semantically meaningful alternatives to determine whether this bias is due\nto data leakage. The observed trends remained consistent, suggesting that the\nbias is not caused by memorization from training data but rather by the\ninherent effect of input order. Additionally, we explored ordering methods\nbased on traditional FL techniques and metrics, finding that DepGraph's ranking\nachieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming simpler approaches such as\nCallGraph(DFS). These findings highlight the importance of structuring inputs,\nmanaging context effectively, and selecting appropriate ordering strategies to\nenhance LLM performance in FL and other software engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has been shown empirically that standard disentangled\nlatent variable models do not support robust compositional learning in the\nvisual domain. Indeed, in spite of being designed with the goal of factorising\ndatasets into their constituent factors of variations, disentangled models show\nextremely limited compositional generalisation capabilities. On the other hand,\nobject-centric architectures have shown promising compositional skills, albeit\nthese have 1) not been extensively tested and 2) experiments have been limited\nto scene composition -- where models must generalise to novel combinations of\nobjects in a visual scene instead of novel combinations of object properties.\nIn this work, we show that these compositional generalisation skills extend to\nthis later setting. Furthermore, we present evidence pointing to the source of\nthese skills and how they can be improved through careful training. Finally, we\npoint to one important limitation that still exists which suggests new\ndirections of research.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world complex systems, such as epidemic spreading networks and\necosystems, can be modeled as networked dynamical systems that produce\nmultivariate time series. Learning the intrinsic dynamics from observational\ndata is pivotal for forecasting system behaviors and making informed decisions.\nHowever, existing methods for modeling networked time series often assume known\ntopologies, whereas real-world networks are typically incomplete or inaccurate,\nwith missing or spurious links that hinder precise predictions. Moreover, while\nnetworked time series often originate from diverse topologies, the ability of\nmodels to generalize across topologies has not been systematically evaluated.\nTo address these gaps, we propose a novel framework for learning network\ndynamics directly from observed time-series data, when prior knowledge of graph\ntopology or governing dynamical equations is absent. Our approach leverages\ncontinuous graph neural networks with an attention mechanism to construct a\nlatent topology, enabling accurate reconstruction of future trajectories for\nnetwork states. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic networks\ndemonstrate that our model not only captures dynamics effectively without\ntopology knowledge but also generalizes to unseen time series originating from\ndiverse topologies.",

    "abstract": "Fuzz testing effectively uncovers software vulnerabilities; however, it faces\nchallenges with Autonomous Systems (AS) due to their vast search spaces and\ncomplex state spaces, which reflect the unpredictability and complexity of\nreal-world environments. This paper presents a universal framework aimed at\nimproving the efficiency of fuzz testing for AS. At its core is SaFliTe, a\npredictive component that evaluates whether a test case meets predefined safety\ncriteria. By leveraging the large language model (LLM) with information about\nthe test objective and the AS state, SaFliTe assesses the relevance of each\ntest case. We evaluated SaFliTe by instantiating it with various LLMs,\nincluding GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-7B, and integrating it into four fuzz\ntesting tools: PGFuzz, DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB. These tools are\ndesigned specifically for testing autonomous drone control systems, such as\nArduPilot, PX4, and PX4-Avoidance. The experimental results demonstrate that,\ncompared to PGFuzz, SaFliTe increased the likelihood of selecting operations\nthat triggered bug occurrences in each fuzzing iteration by an average of\n93.1\\%. Additionally, after integrating SaFliTe, the ability of\nDeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB to generate test cases that caused system\nviolations increased by 234.5\\%, 33.3\\%, and 17.8\\%, respectively. The\nbenchmark for this evaluation was sourced from a UAV Testing Competition.",

    "abstract": "We study a pathfinding problem where only locations (i.e., vertices) are\ngiven, and edges are implicitly defined by an oracle answering the connectivity\nof two locations. Despite its simple structure, this problem becomes\nnon-trivial with a massive number of locations, due to posing a huge branching\nfactor for search algorithms. Limiting the number of successors, such as with\nnearest neighbors, can reduce search efforts but compromises completeness.\nInstead, we propose a novel LaCAS* algorithm, which does not generate\nsuccessors all at once but gradually generates successors as the search\nprogresses. This scheme is implemented with k-nearest neighbors search on a k-d\ntree. LaCAS* is a complete and anytime algorithm that eventually converges to\nthe optima. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of LaCAS*, e.g.,\nsolving complex pathfinding instances quickly, where conventional methods\nfalter.",

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy resources into power grids has\nled to time-varying system inertia and consequent degradation in frequency\ndynamics. A promising solution to alleviate performance degradation is using\npower electronics interfaced energy resources, such as renewable generators and\nbattery energy storage for primary frequency control, by adjusting their power\noutput set-points in response to frequency deviations. However, designing a\nfrequency controller under time-varying inertia is challenging. Specifically,\nthe stability or optimality of controllers designed for time-invariant systems\ncan be compromised once applied to a time-varying system. We model the\nfrequency dynamics under time-varying inertia as a nonlinear switching system,\nwhere the frequency dynamics under each mode are described by the nonlinear\nswing equations and different modes represent different inertia levels. We\nidentify a key controller structure, named Neural Proportional-Integral\n(Neural-PI) controller, that guarantees exponential input-to-state stability\nfor each mode. To further improve performance, we present an online\nevent-triggered switching algorithm to select the most suitable controller from\na set of Neural-PI controllers, each optimized for specific inertia levels.\nSimulations on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed online switching control method with stability guarantees and\noptimized performance for frequency control under time-varying inertia.",

We conducted a series of experiments\nusing the TD3 algorithm across various MuJoCo environments. Our results, for\nthe first time, empirically demonstrate the potential of incorporating\nsecond-order optimizers within PBT-based RL. Specifically, the combination of\nthe K-FAC optimizer with Adam led to up to a 10% improvement in overall\nperformance compared to PBT using only Adam.

Prior research has often focused on\nisolated media bias dimensions such as \\textit{political bias} or\n\\textit{racial bias}, neglecting the complex interrelationships among various\nbias dimensions across different topic domains. Moreover, we observe that\nmodels trained on existing media bias benchmarks fail to generalize effectively\non recent social media posts, particularly in certain bias identification\ntasks. This shortfall primarily arises because these benchmarks do not\nadequately reflect the rapidly evolving nature of social media content, which\nis characterized by shifting user behaviors and emerging trends. In response to\nthese limitations, our research introduces a novel dataset collected from\nYouTube and Reddit over the past five years. Our dataset includes automated\nannotations for YouTube content across a broad spectrum of bias dimensions,\nsuch as gender, racial, and political biases, as well as hate speech, among\nothers. It spans diverse domains including politics, sports, healthcare,\neducation, and entertainment, reflecting the complex interplay of biases across\ndifferent societal sectors. Through comprehensive statistical analysis, we\nidentify significant differences in bias expression patterns and intra-domain\nbias correlations across these domains. By utilizing our understanding of the\ncorrelations among various bias dimensions, we lay the groundwork for creating\nadvanced systems capable of detecting multiple biases simultaneously.

The performance decline increases with the spatial granularity of the\ninput data. Our augmentation technique improves SOA model performance by up to\n67 % for RGB data and 90 % for HSI data, achieving performance at the level of\nin-distribution performance on real OOD test data.

    "abstract": "Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer\nmodels in language modeling while having advantageous deployment\ncharacteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we\nconsider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We\ndemonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs\nby reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic\nGPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the\nattention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer\nin chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from\nscratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding\nalgorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models.\nOverall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of\nthe original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more\nefficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct,\nachieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and\n7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN\nmodel. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation,\nshowing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the\ndistillation length.

Accurate brain tissue segmentations for morphological analysis are\nessential in numerous infant studies. However, due to ongoing white matter (WM)\nmyelination changing tissue contrast in T1- and T2-weighted images, automatic\ntissue segmentation in 6-month infants is particularly difficult.

    "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer\nvision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of\nanomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which\nthey occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces\nadditional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential\nbiases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects.\nThese issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and\ngeneralizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on\npose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate\nprivacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background\ninterference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based\narchitecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA\nintroduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP)\ntokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion\nover time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism\ncaptures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than\nfocusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further\nemphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's\ncore, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly\nimproves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive\nevaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA\nconsistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art\nin pose-based VAD.",

Accurate wind speed\nforecasting (WSF) is crucial for optimizing wind energy capture and ensuring\nsystem stability. However, predicting wind speed remains challenging due to its\ninherent randomness, fluctuation, and unpredictability. This study proposes the\nTemporal Convolutional Network Former (TCNFormer) for short-term (12-hour) wind\nspeed forecasting. The TCNFormer integrates the Temporal Convolutional Network\n(TCN) and transformer encoder to capture the spatio-temporal features of wind\nspeed. The transformer encoder consists of two distinct attention mechanisms:\ncausal temporal multi-head self-attention (CT-MSA) and temporal external\nattention (TEA). CT-MSA ensures that the output of a step derives only from\nprevious steps, i.e., causality. Locality is also introduced to improve\nefficiency. TEA explores potential relationships between different sample\nsequences in wind speed data. This study utilizes wind speed data from the NASA\nPrediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA POWER) of Patenga Sea Beach,\nChittagong, Bangladesh (latitude 22.2352{\\deg} N, longitude 91.7914{\\deg} E)\nover a year (six seasons).

Tools and methods are\nbased on different approaches, each with their own advantages and drawbacks,\nand they need to be mapped out and explained in order to select the most\nsuitable one for a given situation. We address this challenge through two\napproaches.

Second, we develop and use an\nexperimental protocol to compare a selection of these tools and methods.

The\nsystematic literature review serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding\nthe array of tools and methods used in evaluating energy consumption of ML, for\nvarious use cases going from basic energy monitoring to consumption\noptimization.

    "abstract": "We have observed a distinctive quantization-related behavior in the\nLLaMA3/3.1-70B models that is absent in both the LLaMA2-70B and\nLLaMA3/3.1/3.2-1B/3B/8B/405B models. Quantization is a crucial technique for\ndeploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. The impact of W8A8\npost-training quantization on model accuracy, especially on the recently\nreleased LLaMA3/3.1 model series, remains contentious. In this paper, we\nexplore three key questions: What makes the LLaMA3-70B model series uniquely\nvulnerable to quantization? Why is this the case? And how can the issue be\naddressed? We empirically investigate multiple LLMs featured on an open LLM\nleaderboard, discovering that the LLaMA3-70B model series have a unique\naccuracy degradation behavior with W8A8 per-channel post-training quantization.\nIn contrast, other model series such as LLaMA2, LLaMA3/3.1-8B, LLaMA3.2, Qwen,\nMixtral, Mistral, Phi-3, and Falcon demonstrate robust performance with W8A8.\nContrary to previous assertions attributing degradation to the large dynamic\nrange of activations, our findings indicate that the weight distribution of the\nLLaMA3-70B is the primary factor behind the vulnerability. By meticulously\nanalyzing the distinct characteristics of weight distributions across\nTransformer blocks, we propose two solutions that make different tradeoffs in\nhardware/software overhead. First, we propose a mixed strategy where less than\n3\\% of the layers employ finer per-group W8A8 quantization granularity. Second,\nwe introduce a bi-smoothing strategy that balances quantization errors between\nweights and activations while maintaining per-channel quantization throughout.\nExperimental results demonstrate that both strategies effectively preserve the\naccuracy of the entire LLaMA3-70B model series under W8A8 quantization,\nachieving performance on par with their FP16 counterparts.",

The\nadopted methodology starts with categorising smart devices by their control\nmechanisms (open-loop, closed-loop, and semi-closed-loop systems) and delving\ninto their technology.

    "abstract": "The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy\nmarkets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and\ncontribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV\npanels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to\nensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We\nstudy a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each\ncontrolling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf\nof the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the\nrepeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and\nadapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other\nand with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping\nwholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We\nmodel this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses\nmarket information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants --\nto enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed\ndecisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their\nportfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control\n(MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes\nthe total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal\nstrategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market\nconditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly\nreach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our\nresults demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field\nlearning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without\nstorage.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero- and few-shot\nperformance on real-world visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, alluding\nto their capabilities as visual reasoning engines. However, the benchmarks\nbeing used conflate \"pure\" visual reasoning with world knowledge, and also have\nquestions that involve a limited number of reasoning steps. Thus, it remains\nunclear whether a VLM's apparent visual reasoning performance is due to its\nworld knowledge, or due to actual visual reasoning capabilities.\n  To clarify this ambiguity, we systematically benchmark and dissect the\nzero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that\nrequire minimal world knowledge, and allow for analysis over a broad range of\nreasoning steps. We focus on two novel aspects of zero-shot visual reasoning:\ni) evaluating the impact of conveying scene information as either visual\nembeddings or purely textual scene descriptions to the underlying large\nlanguage model (LLM) of the VLM, and ii) comparing the effectiveness of\nchain-of-thought prompting to standard prompting for zero-shot visual\nreasoning.\n  We find that the underlying LLMs, when provided textual scene descriptions,\nconsistently perform better compared to being provided visual embeddings. In\nparticular, 18% higher accuracy is achieved on the PTR dataset. We also find\nthat CoT prompting performs marginally better than standard prompting only for\nthe comparatively large GPT-3.5-Turbo (175B) model, and does worse for\nsmaller-scale models. This suggests the emergence of CoT abilities for visual\nreasoning in LLMs at larger scales even when world knowledge is limited.\nOverall, we find limitations in the abilities of VLMs and LLMs for more complex\nvisual reasoning, and highlight the important role that LLMs can play in visual\nreasoning.",

This work investigates how\nexisting UED methods select training environments, focusing on task\nprioritisation metrics.

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by significant challenges in\nsocial interaction and comprehending communication signals. Recently,\ntherapeutic interventions for ASD have increasingly utilized Deep learning\npowered-computer vision techniques to monitor individual progress over time.\nThese models are trained on private, non-public datasets from the autism\ncommunity, creating challenges in comparing results across different models due\nto privacy-preserving data-sharing issues. This work introduces MMASD+, an\nenhanced version of the novel open-source dataset called Multimodal ASD\n(MMASD). MMASD+ consists of diverse data modalities, including 3D-Skeleton, 3D\nBody Mesh, and Optical Flow data. It integrates the capabilities of Yolov8 and\nDeep SORT algorithms to distinguish between the therapist and children,\naddressing a significant barrier in the original dataset. Additionally, a\nMultimodal Transformer framework is proposed to predict 11 action types and the\npresence of ASD. This framework achieves an accuracy of 95.03% for predicting\naction types and 96.42% for predicting ASD presence, demonstrating over a 10%\nimprovement compared to models trained on single data modalities. These\nfindings highlight the advantages of integrating multiple data modalities\nwithin the Multimodal Transformer framework.",

Despite the progress made, Multiple Instance Learning\n(MIL), a promising paradigm within CPath, continues to face challenges,\nparticularly related to incomplete information utilization. Existing\nframeworks, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),\nattention, and selective scan space state sequential model (SSM), lack\nsufficient flexibility and scalability in fusing diverse features, and cannot\neffectively fuse diverse features. Additionally, current approaches do not\nadequately exploit order-related and order-independent features, resulting in\nsuboptimal utilization of sequence information. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel MIL framework called Mamba2MIL. Our framework utilizes the\nstate space duality model (SSD) to model long sequences of patches of whole\nslide images (WSIs), which, combined with weighted feature selection, supports\nthe fusion processing of more branching features and can be extended according\nto specific application needs. Moreover, we introduce a sequence transformation\nmethod tailored to varying WSI sizes, which enhances sequence-independent\nfeatures while preserving local sequence information, thereby improving\nsequence information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMamba2MIL surpasses state-of-the-art MIL methods. We conducted extensive\nexperiments across multiple datasets, achieving improvements in nearly all\nperformance metrics. Specifically, on the NSCLC dataset, Mamba2MIL achieves a\nbinary tumor classification AUC of 0.9533 and an accuracy of 0.8794.

Cardiac ultrasound faces two\nmajor challenges: (1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2)\nsignificant individual variations. Previous works have only learned the\npopulation-averaged 2D and 3D structures of the heart rather than personalized\ncardiac structural features, leading to a performance bottleneck. Clinically,\nwe observed that sonographers adjust their understanding of a patient's cardiac\nstructure based on prior scanning sequences, thereby modifying their scanning\nstrategies. Inspired by this, we propose a sequence-aware self-supervised\npre-training method. Specifically, our approach learns personalized 2D and 3D\ncardiac structural features by predicting the masked-out images and actions in\na scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing\ncontent it has acquired a good understanding of the personalized cardiac\nstructure. In the downstream probe guidance task, we also introduced a sequence\nmodeling approach that models individual cardiac structural information based\non the images and actions from historical scan data, enabling more accurate\nnavigation decisions. Experiments on a large-scale dataset with 1.36 million\nsamples demonstrated that our proposed sequence-aware paradigm can\nsignificantly reduce navigation errors, with translation errors decreasing by\n15.90% to 36.87% and rotation errors decreasing by 11.13% to 20.77%, compared\nto state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Even in the era of large models, one of the well-known issues in continual\nlearning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, which is significantly challenging\nwhen the continual data stream exhibits a long-tailed distribution, termed as\nLong-Tailed Continual Learning (LTCL). Existing LTCL solutions generally\nrequire the label distribution of the data stream to achieve re-balance\ntraining. However, obtaining such prior information is often infeasible in real\nscenarios since the model should learn without pre-identifying the majority and\nminority classes. To this end, we propose a novel Prior-free Balanced Replay\n(PBR) framework to learn from long-tailed data stream with less forgetting.\nConcretely, motivated by our experimental finding that the minority classes are\nmore likely to be forgotten due to the higher uncertainty, we newly design an\nuncertainty-guided reservoir sampling strategy to prioritize rehearsing\nminority data without using any prior information, which is based on the mutual\ndependence between the model and samples. Additionally, we incorporate two\nprior-free components to further reduce the forgetting issue: (1) Boundary\nconstraint is to preserve uncertain boundary supporting samples for continually\nre-estimating task boundaries. (2) Prototype constraint is to maintain the\nconsistency of learned class prototypes along with training. Our approach is\nevaluated on three standard long-tailed benchmarks, demonstrating superior\nperformance to existing CL methods and previous SOTA LTCL approach in both\ntask- and class-incremental learning settings, as well as ordered- and\nshuffled-LTCL settings.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid expansion of model sizes has led to large-scale\npre-trained models demonstrating remarkable capabilities. Consequently, there\nhas been a trend towards increasing the scale of models. However, this trend\nintroduces significant challenges, including substantial computational costs of\ntraining and transfer to downstream tasks. To address these issues,\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced. These\nmethods optimize large-scale pre-trained models for specific tasks by\nfine-tuning a select group of parameters. Among these PEFT methods,\nadapter-based and prompt-based methods are the primary techniques.\nSpecifically, in the field of visual fine-tuning, adapters gain prominence over\nprompts because of the latter's relatively weaker performance and efficiency.\nUnder the circumstances, we refine the widely-used Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT)\nmethod, proposing Cross Visual Prompt Tuning (CVPT). CVPT calculates\ncross-attention between the prompt tokens and the embedded tokens, which allows\nus to compute the semantic relationship between them and conduct the\nfine-tuning of models exactly to adapt visual tasks better. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the weight-sharing mechanism to initialize the parameters of\ncross-attention, which avoids massive learnable parameters from cross-attention\nand enhances the representative capability of cross-attention. We conduct\ncomprehensive testing across 25 datasets and the result indicates that CVPT\nsignificantly improves VPT's performance and efficiency in visual tasks. For\nexample, on the VTAB-1K benchmark, CVPT outperforms VPT over 4% in average\naccuracy, rivaling the advanced adapter-based methods in performance and\nefficiency. Our experiments confirm that prompt-based methods can achieve\nexceptional results in visual fine-tuning.",

As\nthe network size increases, designing and implementing cross-domain multicast\nrouting paths in the network requires not only designing efficient solution\nalgorithms to obtain the optimal cross-domain multicast tree but also ensuring\nthe timely and flexible acquisition and maintenance of global network state\ninformation. However, existing solutions have a limited ability to sense the\nnetwork traffic state, affecting the quality of service of multicast services.\nIn addition, these methods have difficulty adapting to the highly dynamically\nchanging network states and have slow convergence speeds. To this end, this\npaper aims to design and implement a multiagent deep reinforcement learning\nbased cross-domain multicast routing method for SDWN with multicontroller\ndomains. First, a multicontroller communication mechanism and a multicast group\nmanagement module are designed to transfer and synchronize network information\nbetween different control domains of the SDWN, thus effectively managing the\njoining and classification of members in the cross-domain multicast group.\nSecond, a theoretical analysis and proof show that the optimal cross-domain\nmulticast tree includes an interdomain multicast tree and an intradomain\nmulticast tree. An agent is established for each controller, and a cooperation\nmechanism between multiple agents is designed to effectively optimize\ncross-domain multicast routing and ensure consistency and validity in the\nrepresentation of network state information for cross-domain multicast routing\ndecisions. Third, a multiagent reinforcement learning-based method that\ncombines online and offline training is designed to reduce the dependence on\nthe real-time environment and increase the convergence speed of multiple\nagents.",

To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel framework, Semantic Outlier generation\nvia Nuisance Awareness (SONA), which notably produces challenging outliers by\ndirectly leveraging pixel-space ID samples through diffusion models. Our\napproach incorporates SONA guidance, providing separate control over semantic\nand nuisance regions of ID samples. Thereby, the generated outliers achieve two\ncrucial properties: (i) they present explicit semantic-discrepant information,\nwhile (ii) maintaining various levels of nuisance resemblance with ID.\nFurthermore, the improved OOD detector training with SONA outliers facilitates\nlearning with a focus on semantic distinctions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving an impressive AUROC\nof 88% on near-OOD datasets, which surpasses the performance of baseline\nmethods by a significant margin of approximately 6%.",

Based on CoderEval, we devised\nexperiments that varied the extent of contextual information in the prompts,\nranging from method-specific to project-wide details. We introduced the\ninnovative metric of \"Prompt-Token Cost-Effectiveness\" to evaluate the economic\nviability of incorporating additional contextual layers.

    "abstract": "Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), \\eg CLIP, are increasingly used to\nbridge the gap between open- and close-vocabulary recognition in\nopen-vocabulary image segmentation. As VLMs are generally pretrained with\nlow-resolution images (e.g. $224\\times224$), most previous methods operate only\non downscaled images. We question this design as low resolution features often\nfail to preserve fine details. A typical solution is to employ additional image\nbackbones for high-resolution inputs, but it also introduce significant\ncomputation overhead. Therefore, we propose MROVSeg, a multi-resolution\ntraining framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation with a single\npretrained CLIP backbone, that uses sliding windows to slice the\nhigh-resolution input into uniform patches, each matching the input size of the\nwell-trained image encoder. Its key components include a Multi-Res Adapter,\nwhich restores the spatial geometry and grasps local-global correspondences\nacross patches by interacting with multi-resolution features. To achieve\naccurate segmentation, we introduce Multi-grained Masked Attention scheme to\naggregate multi-grained semantics from multi-resolution CLIP features to object\nqueries. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of\nMROVSeg on well-established open-vocabulary image segmentation benchmarks,\nestablishing new standards for open-vocabulary image segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in language tasks, especially with\nsupervised fine-tuning after pre-training. However, their substantial memory\nand computational requirements hinder practical applications. Structural\npruning, which reduces less significant weight dimensions, is one solution.\nYet, traditional post-hoc pruning often leads to significant performance loss,\nwith limited recovery from further fine-tuning due to reduced capacity. Since\nthe model fine-tuning refines the general and chaotic knowledge in pre-trained\nmodels, we aim to incorporate structural pruning with the fine-tuning, and\npropose the Pruning-Aware Tuning (PAT) paradigm to eliminate model redundancy\nwhile preserving the model performance to the maximum extend. Specifically, we\ninsert the innovative Hybrid Sparsification Modules (HSMs) between the\nAttention and FFN components to accordingly sparsify the upstream and\ndownstream linear modules. The HSM comprises a lightweight operator and a\nglobally shared trainable mask. The lightweight operator maintains a training\noverhead comparable to that of LoRA, while the trainable mask unifies the\nchannels to be sparsified, ensuring structural pruning. Additionally, we\npropose the Identity Loss which decouples the transformation and scaling\nproperties of the HSMs to enhance training robustness. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PAT excels in both performance and efficiency. For example,\nour Llama2-7b model with a 25\\% pruning ratio achieves 1.33$\\times$ speedup\nwhile outperforming the LoRA-finetuned model by up to 1.26\\% in accuracy with a\nsimilar training cost.

    "abstract": "The Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) plays a pivotal role in 5G networks,\noptimizing infrastructure dynamically to ensure high Quality of Service (QoS).\nRecent research has focused on improving CQI estimation in 5G networks using\nmachine learning. In this field, the selection of the proper loss function is\ncritical for training an accurate model. Two commonly used loss functions are\nMean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Roughly speaking, MSE\nput more weight on outliers, MAE on the majority. Here, we argue that the Huber\nloss function is more suitable for CQI prediction, since it combines the\nbenefits of both MSE and MAE. To achieve this, the Huber loss transitions\nsmoothly between MSE and MAE, controlled by a user-defined hyperparameter\ncalled delta. However, finding the right balance between sensitivity to small\nerrors (MAE) and robustness to outliers (MSE) by manually choosing the optimal\ndelta is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss function,\nnamed Residual-based Adaptive Huber Loss (RAHL). In RAHL, a learnable residual\nis added to the delta, enabling the model to adapt based on the distribution of\nerrors in the data. Our approach effectively balances model robustness against\noutliers while preserving inlier data precision. The widely recognized Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed in conjunction with RAHL, showcasing\nsignificantly improved results compared to the aforementioned loss functions.\nThe obtained results affirm the superiority of RAHL, offering a promising\navenue for enhanced CQI prediction in 5G networks.",

    "abstract": "AI systems that serve natural language questions over databases promise to\nunlock tremendous value. Such systems would allow users to leverage the\npowerful reasoning and knowledge capabilities of language models (LMs)\nalongside the scalable computational power of data management systems. These\ncombined capabilities would empower users to ask arbitrary natural language\nquestions over custom data sources. However, existing methods and benchmarks\ninsufficiently explore this setting. Text2SQL methods focus solely on natural\nlanguage questions that can be expressed in relational algebra, representing a\nsmall subset of the questions real users wish to ask. Likewise,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) considers the limited subset of queries\nthat can be answered with point lookups to one or a few data records within the\ndatabase. We propose Table-Augmented Generation (TAG), a unified and\ngeneral-purpose paradigm for answering natural language questions over\ndatabases. The TAG model represents a wide range of interactions between the LM\nand database that have been previously unexplored and creates exciting research\nopportunities for leveraging the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of\nLMs over data. We systematically develop benchmarks to study the TAG problem\nand find that standard methods answer no more than 20% of queries correctly,\nconfirming the need for further research in this area. We release code for the\nbenchmark at https://github.com/TAG-Research/TAG-Bench.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces StyleSpeech, a novel Text-to-Speech~(TTS) system that\nenhances the naturalness and accuracy of synthesized speech. Building upon\nexisting TTS technologies, StyleSpeech incorporates a unique Style Decorator\nstructure that enables deep learning models to simultaneously learn style and\nphoneme features, improving adaptability and efficiency through the principles\nof Lower Rank Adaptation~(LoRA). LoRA allows efficient adaptation of style\nfeatures in pre-trained models. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic\nevaluation metric, the LLM-Guided Mean Opinion Score (LLM-MOS), which employs\nlarge language models to offer an objective and robust protocol for\nautomatically assessing TTS system performance. Extensive testing on benchmark\ndatasets shows that our approach markedly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods in producing natural, accurate, and high-quality speech. These\nadvancements not only pushes the boundaries of current TTS system capabilities,\nbut also facilitate the application of TTS system in more dynamic and\nspecialized, such as interactive virtual assistants, adaptive audiobooks, and\ncustomized voice for gaming.

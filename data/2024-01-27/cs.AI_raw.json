    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry, where research, design,\nverification, and manufacturing are intricately linked, the potential of Large\nLanguage Models to revolutionize hardware design and security verification is\nimmense. The primary challenge, however, lies in the complexity of hardware\nspecific issues that are not adequately addressed by the natural language or\nsoftware code knowledge typically acquired during the pretraining stage.\nAdditionally, the scarcity of datasets specific to the hardware domain poses a\nsignificant hurdle in developing a foundational model. Addressing these\nchallenges, this paper introduces Hardware Phi 1.5B, an innovative large\nlanguage model specifically tailored for the hardware domain of the\nsemiconductor industry. We have developed a specialized, tiered dataset\ncomprising small, medium, and large subsets and focused our efforts on\npretraining using the medium dataset. This approach harnesses the compact yet\nefficient architecture of the Phi 1.5B model. The creation of this first\npretrained, hardware domain specific large language model marks a significant\nadvancement, offering improved performance in hardware design and verification\ntasks and illustrating a promising path forward for AI applications in the\nsemiconductor sector.",

    "abstract": "With the improvements in generative models, the issues of producing\nhallucinations in various domains (e.g., law, writing) have been brought to\npeople's attention due to concerns about misinformation. In this paper, we\nfocus on neural fake news, which refers to content generated by neural networks\naiming to mimic the style of real news to deceive people. To prevent harmful\ndisinformation spreading fallaciously from malicious social media (e.g.,\ncontent farms), we propose a novel verification framework, Style-News, using\npublisher metadata to imply a publisher's template with the corresponding text\ntypes, political stance, and credibility. Based on threat modeling aspects, a\nstyle-aware neural news generator is introduced as an adversary for generating\nnews content conditioning for a specific publisher, and style and source\ndiscriminators are trained to defend against this attack by identifying which\npublisher the style corresponds with, and discriminating whether the source of\nthe given news is human-written or machine-generated. To evaluate the quality\nof the generated content, we integrate various dimensional metrics (language\nfluency, content preservation, and style adherence) and demonstrate that\nStyle-News significantly outperforms the previous approaches by a margin of\n0.35 for fluency, 15.24 for content, and 0.38 for style at most.

While previous\nstudies have found that the average quality of AI ideas is quite high, prior\nresearch also has pointed to the inability of AI-based brainstorming to create\nsufficient dispersion of ideas, which limits novelty and the quality of the\noverall best idea. Our research investigates methods to increase the dispersion\nin AI-generated ideas.

We do this in the domain of\ndeveloping a new product development for college students, priced under $50. In\nthis context, we find that (1) pools of ideas generated by GPT-4 with various\nplausible prompts are less diverse than ideas generated by groups of human\nsubjects (2) the diversity of AI generated ideas can be substantially improved\nusing prompt engineering (3) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting leads to the\nhighest diversity of ideas of all prompts we evaluated and was able to come\nclose to what is achieved by groups of human subjects.

However, these models frequently focus on\nspecific material objectives or structural properties, limiting their\nflexibility when incorporating out-of-domain knowledge into the design process\nor comprehensive data analysis is required. In this study, we introduce\nProtAgents, a platform for de novo protein design based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs), where multiple AI agents with distinct capabilities\ncollaboratively address complex tasks within a dynamic environment. The\nversatility in agent development allows for expertise in diverse domains,\nincluding knowledge retrieval, protein structure analysis, physics-based\nsimulations, and results analysis. The dynamic collaboration between agents,\nempowered by LLMs, provides a versatile approach to tackling protein design and\nanalysis problems, as demonstrated through diverse examples in this study. The\nproblems of interest encompass designing new proteins, analyzing protein\nstructures and obtaining new first-principles data -- natural vibrational\nfrequencies -- via physics simulations. The concerted effort of the system\nallows for powerful automated and synergistic design of de novo proteins with\ntargeted mechanical properties.

Detecting the\nfamiliarity level of a user with VR as an interaction medium provides the\npotential of providing on-demand training for acclimatization and prevents the\nuser from being burdened by the VR environment in accomplishing their tasks. In\nthis work, we present preliminary results of using deep classifiers to conduct\nautomatic detection of familiarity with VR by using hand tracking of the user\nas they interact with a numeric passcode entry panel to unlock a VR door.

Using a pilot dataset\nconsisting of 7 users familiar with VR, and 7 not familiar with VR, we acquire\nhighest accuracy of 88.03\\% when 6 test users, 3 familiar and 3 not familiar,\nare evaluated with classifiers trained using data from the remaining 8 users.\nOur results indicate potential for using user movement data to detect\nfamiliarity for the simple yet important task of secure passcode-based access.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) bears the promise of being a game-changer in many\napplications. However, since most of the literature in the field is currently\nfocused on opaque models, the use of RL in high-stakes scenarios, where\ninterpretability is crucial, is still limited. Recently, some approaches to\ninterpretable RL, e.g., based on Decision Trees, have been proposed, but one of\nthe main limitations of these techniques is their training cost. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a new method, called Social Interpretable RL\n(SIRL), that can substantially reduce the number of episodes needed for\ntraining. Our method mimics a social learning process, where each agent in a\ngroup learns to solve a given task based both on its own individual experience\nas well as the experience acquired together with its peers. Our approach is\ndivided into the following two phases. (1) In the collaborative phase, all the\nagents in the population interact with a shared instance of the environment,\nwhere each agent observes the state and independently proposes an action. Then,\nvoting is performed to choose the action that will actually be deployed in the\nenvironment. (2) In the individual phase, then, each agent refines its\nindividual performance by interacting with its own instance of the environment.\nThis mechanism makes the agents experience a larger number of episodes with\nlittle impact on the computational cost of the process. Our results (on 6\nwidely-known RL benchmarks) show that SIRL not only reduces the computational\ncost by a factor varying from a minimum of 43% to a maximum 76%, but it also\nincreases the convergence speed and, often, improves the quality of the\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "Major advances in telecommunications and the Internet of Things have given\nrise to numerous smart city scenarios in which smart services are provided.\nWhat was once a dream for the future has now become reality. However, the need\nto provide these smart services quickly, efficiently, in an interoperable\nmanner and in real time is a cutting-edge technological challenge. Although\nsome software architectures offer solutions in this area, these are often\nlimited in terms of reusability and maintenance by independent modules,\ninvolving the need for system downtime when maintaining or evolving, as well as\nby a lack of standards in terms of the interoperability of their interface. In\nthis paper, we propose a fully reusable microservice architecture, standardized\nthrough the use of the Web of things paradigm, and with high efficiency in\nreal-time data processing, supported by complex event processing techniques. To\nillustrate the proposal, we present a fully reusable implementation of the\nmicroservices necessary for the deployment of the architecture in the field of\nair quality monitoring and alerting in smart ports.

The success of methods for eviction prediction is\ntypically evaluated using different measures of predictive accuracy. However,\nthe underlying goal of such prediction is to direct appropriate assistance to\nhouseholds that may be at greater risk so they remain stably housed. Thus, we\nmust ask the question of how useful such predictions are in targeting outreach\nefforts - informing action. In this paper, we investigate this question using a\nnovel dataset that matches information on properties, evictions, and owners. We\nperform an eviction prediction task to produce risk scores and then use these\nrisk scores to plan targeted outreach policies. We show that the risk scores\nare, in fact, useful, enabling a theoretical team of caseworkers to reach more\neviction-prone properties in the same amount of time, compared to outreach\npolicies that are either neighborhood-based or focus on buildings with a recent\nhistory of evictions. We also discuss the importance of neighborhood and\nownership features in both risk prediction and targeted outreach.",

These models, including GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-2, have revolutionized\ntext generation, translation, and question-answering tasks due to the\ntransformative Transformer model. Despite their widespread use, LLMs present\nchallenges such as ethical dilemmas when models are compelled to respond\ninappropriately, susceptibility to phishing attacks, and privacy violations.\nThis paper addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-pronged approach\nthat includes: 1) filtering sensitive vocabulary from user input to prevent\nunethical responses; 2) detecting role-playing to halt interactions that could\nlead to 'prison break' scenarios; 3) implementing custom rule engines to\nrestrict the generation of prohibited content; and 4) extending these\nmethodologies to various LLM derivatives like Multi-Model Large Language Models\n(MLLMs). Our approach not only fortifies models against unethical manipulations\nand privacy breaches but also maintains their high performance across tasks. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance under various attack prompts, without\ncompromising the model's core functionalities. Furthermore, the introduction of\ndifferentiated security levels empowers users to control their personal data\ndisclosure. Our methods contribute to reducing social risks and conflicts\narising from technological abuse, enhance data protection, and promote social\nequity.

This kind of continuous monitoring, in contrast to\nthe short-term one, collects an extended period of fetal heart data. This\noffers a more comprehensive understanding of fetus's conditions. However, the\ninterpretation of long-term antenatal fetal heart monitoring is still in its\nearly stages, lacking corresponding clinical standards. Furthermore, the\nsubstantial amount of data generated by continuous monitoring imposes a\nsignificant burden on clinical work when analyzed manually. To address above\nchallenges, this study develops an automatic analysis system named LARA\n(Long-term Antepartum Risk Analysis system) for continuous FHR monitoring,\ncombining deep learning and information fusion methods. LARA's core is a\nwell-established convolutional neural network (CNN) model. It processes\nlong-term FHR data as input and generates a Risk Distribution Map (RDM) and\nRisk Index (RI) as the analysis results. We evaluate LARA on inner test\ndataset, the performance metrics are as follows: AUC 0.872, accuracy 0.816,\nspecificity 0.811, sensitivity 0.806, precision 0.271, and F1 score 0.415. In\nour study, we observe that long-term FHR monitoring data with higher RI is more\nlikely to result in adverse outcomes (p=0.0021). In conclusion, this study\nintroduces LARA, the first automated analysis system for long-term FHR\nmonitoring, initiating the further explorations into its clinical value in the\nfuture.",

A major setback in this approach lies\nin the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and\nresolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we\npresent a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of\nthe leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for\nproduction purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to\nenable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of\nfactory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to\naddress numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply\nchain analytics and planning.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification via 3D skeletons is an important emerging research\narea that attracts increasing attention within the pattern recognition\ncommunity. With distinctive advantages across various application scenarios,\nnumerous 3D skeleton based person re-identification (SRID) methods with diverse\nskeleton modeling and learning paradigms have been proposed in recent years. In\nthis survey, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of recent SRID\nadvances. First of all, we define the SRID task and provide an overview of its\norigin and major advancements. Secondly, we formulate a systematic taxonomy\nthat organizes existing methods into three categories based on different\nskeleton modeling ($i.e.,$ hand-crafted, sequence-based, graph-based). Then, we\nelaborate on the representative models along these three categories with an\nanalysis of their merits and limitations. Meanwhile, we provide an in-depth\nreview of mainstream supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised SRID\nlearning paradigms and corresponding skeleton semantics learning tasks. A\nthorough evaluation of state-of-the-art SRID methods is further conducted over\nvarious types of benchmarks and protocols to compare their effectiveness and\nefficiency. Finally, we discuss the challenges of existing studies along with\npromising directions for future research, highlighting research impacts and\npotential applications of SRID.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers are known to be more computationally and data-intensive\nthan CNN models. These transformer models such as ViT, require all the input\nimage tokens to learn the relationship among them. However, many of these\ntokens are not informative and may contain irrelevant information such as\nunrelated background or unimportant scenery. These tokens are overlooked by the\nmulti-head self-attention (MHSA), resulting in many redundant and unnecessary\ncomputations in MHSA and the feed-forward network (FFN). In this work, we\npropose a method to optimize the amount of unnecessary interactions between\nunimportant tokens by separating and sending them through a different low-cost\ncomputational path. Our method does not add any parameters to the ViT model and\naims to find the best trade-off between training throughput and achieving a 0%\nloss in the Top-1 accuracy of the final model. Our experimental results on\ntraining ViT-small from scratch show that SkipViT is capable of effectively\ndropping 55% of the tokens while gaining more than 13% training throughput and\nmaintaining classification accuracy at the level of the baseline model on\nHuawei Ascend910A.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific\nresearch, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the\ndevelopment of ethical guidelines, leading to a Triple-Too problem: too many\nhigh-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and\npractical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits\nand utilities. Existing approaches, including principlism (reliance on abstract\nethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technical\nsolutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes), offer little practical\nguidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research\npractices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day\nresearch practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed\nhere. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding\nmodel training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting\nprivacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy\nviolations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using\nAI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionable\nstrategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue that\nethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing\nalternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I propose\ndocumentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in\nAI-assisted research. Moving forward, we need targeted professional\ndevelopment, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote\nresponsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical\nguidelines and adapting them to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate\nscientific progress without compromising research integrity.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of large language models\n(LLMs) in various domains. To better serve the large number of Chinese users,\nmany commercial vendors in China have adopted localization strategies, training\nand providing local LLMs specifically customized for Chinese users.\nFurthermore, looking ahead, one of the key future applications of LLMs will be\npractical deployment in industrial production by enterprises and users in those\nsectors. However, the accuracy and robustness of LLMs in industrial scenarios\nhave not been well studied. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical\nstudy on the accuracy and robustness of LLMs in the context of the Chinese\nindustrial production area. We manually collected 1,200 domain-specific\nproblems from 8 different industrial sectors to evaluate LLM accuracy.\nFurthermore, we designed a metamorphic testing framework containing four\nindustrial-specific stability categories with eight abilities, totaling 13,631\nquestions with variants to evaluate LLM robustness. In total, we evaluated 9\ndifferent LLMs developed by Chinese vendors, as well as four different LLMs\ndeveloped by global vendors. Our major findings include: (1) Current LLMs\nexhibit low accuracy in Chinese industrial contexts, with all LLMs scoring less\nthan 0.6. (2) The robustness scores vary across industrial sectors, and local\nLLMs overall perform worse than global ones. (3) LLM robustness differs\nsignificantly across abilities. Global LLMs are more robust under\nlogical-related variants, while advanced local LLMs perform better on problems\nrelated to understanding Chinese industrial terminology. Our study results\nprovide valuable guidance for understanding and promoting the industrial domain\ncapabilities of LLMs from both development and industrial enterprise\nperspectives. The results further motivate possible research directions and\ntooling support.",

    "abstract": "Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved\na milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging\nfrom multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges\nthat still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching\ndocuments from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or\nselectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying\nexisting methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization\nbecomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate\njudgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for\nbiomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving\ndomain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize\n84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess\nits generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves\nthat domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document\ncorpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related\ninstructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets,\nexperimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains\nby achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art\nopen-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze\nthat Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents\nif needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved\ndocuments and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does. We release our data\nand code for training our framework components and model weights (7B and 13B)\nto enhance capabilities in biomedical and clinical domains.",

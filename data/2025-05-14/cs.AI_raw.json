    "abstract": "Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL), encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL, adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural language tasks, but their ability to forecast violent conflict remains underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting, models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g., Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured external knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation. Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that generalize to new settings.",

Patient records were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness. Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters, identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing richer context and prioritizing key features.

Analyzing 216 papers published between 2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol, which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types (e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare - and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER, MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall progress of the field.",

This process is time-consuming and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information, including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture, enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent entities like EVOL.",

While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods.

    "abstract": "This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex, heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its predictions.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric, expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful explainable AI in medical diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "The data landscape is rich with structured data, often of high value to organizations, driving important applications in data analysis and machine learning. Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components, in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks.

However, a person affected by an AI system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they, if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases, distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust in the first place. We propose the term \"healthy distrust\" to describe such a justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history, psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that respects human autonomy.",

Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively \"opening\" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.",

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations, particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions: the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement in these aggregate scores.",

The proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices while rigorously maintaining data privacy.

    "abstract": "The coupling signal refers to a latent physiological signal that characterizes the transformation from cardiac electrical excitation, captured by the electrocardiogram (ECG), to mechanical contraction, recorded by the phonocardiogram (PCG). By encoding the temporal and functional interplay between electrophysiological and hemodynamic events, it serves as an intrinsic link between modalities and offers a unified representation of cardiac function, with strong potential to enhance multi-modal cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection. However, existing coupling signal estimation methods remain highly vulnerable to noise, particularly in real-world clinical and physiological settings, which undermines their robustness and limits practical value. In this study, we propose Noise-Robust Multi-Modal Coupling Signal Estimation (NMCSE), which reformulates coupling signal estimation as a distribution matching problem solved via optimal transport. By jointly aligning amplitude and timing, NMCSE avoids noise amplification and enables stable signal estimation. When integrated into a Temporal-Spatial Feature Extraction (TSFE) network, the estimated coupling signal effectively enhances multi-modal fusion for more accurate CVD detection. To evaluate robustness under real-world conditions, we design two complementary experiments targeting distinct sources of noise. The first uses the PhysioNet 2016 dataset with simulated hospital noise to assess the resilience of NMCSE to clinical interference. The second leverages the EPHNOGRAM dataset with motion-induced physiological noise to evaluate intra-state estimation stability across activity levels. Experimental results show that NMCSE consistently outperforms existing methods under both clinical and physiological noise, highlighting it as a noise-robust estimation approach that enables reliable multi-modal cardiac detection in real-world conditions.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data, it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct features for compositional generalisation.",

This study examines the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning, all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the literature.",

However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding. See our website at: https://manipbench.github.io.",

    "abstract": "Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers which need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established Blicket Test paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This \"disjunctive bias\" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not child-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.",

    "abstract": "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in hardware design has taken off in recent years, principally through its incorporation in tools that increase chip designer productivity. There has been considerable discussion about the use of LLMs in RTL specifications of chip designs, for which the two most popular languages are Verilog and VHDL. LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models in commercial datacenters. The framework combines public API performance data with company-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost and provide a dynamically updated dashboard that visualizes model-level energy, water, and carbon metrics. Results show the most energy-intensive models exceed 29 Wh per long prompt, over 65 times the most efficient systems. Even a 0.42 Wh short query, when scaled to 700M queries/day, aggregates to annual electricity comparable to 35{,}000 U.S. homes, evaporative freshwater equal to the annual drinking needs of 1.2M people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings highlight a growing paradox: as AI becomes cheaper and faster, global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our methodology offers a standardized, empirically grounded basis for sustainability benchmarking and accountability in AI deployment.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly trained and aligned in ways that reinforce Western-centric epistemologies and socio-cultural norms, leading to cultural homogenization and limiting their ability to reflect global civilizational plurality. Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately capture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook the complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce WorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity (GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our approach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al., which distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural homogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives. WorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative perspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional categorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two intervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where system prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing distinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) entropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, alongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural balance. These findings highlight the potential of multiplex-aware AI evaluation in mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, paving the way for more inclusive and ethically aligned AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in recent years, vision language models (VLMs) remain prone to overconfidence and hallucinations on tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Visual Reasoning. Bayesian methods can potentially improve reliability by helping models selectively predict, that is, models respond only when they are sufficiently confident. Unfortunately, Bayesian methods are often assumed to be costly and ineffective for large models, and so far there exists little evidence to show otherwise, especially for multimodal applications. Here, we show the effectiveness and competitive edge of variational Bayes for selective prediction in VQA for the first time. We build on recent advances in variational methods for deep learning and propose an extension called \"Variational VQA\". This method improves calibration and yields significant gains for selective prediction on VQA and Visual Reasoning, particularly when the error tolerance is low ($\\leq 1\\%$). Often, just one posterior sample can yield more reliable answers than those obtained by models trained with AdamW. In addition, we propose a new risk-averse selector that outperforms standard sample averaging by considering the variance of predictions. Overall, we present compelling evidence that variational learning is a viable option to make large VLMs safer and more trustworthy.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more \"human-like\" than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative AI chatbots.",

    "abstract": "Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies. Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes, objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design, training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks. To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code, model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning datasets.",

We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and accurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion corruption. Our approach performs motion correction, outlier handling, and super-resolution reconstruction with all operations being entirely based on implicit neural representations. The model can be initialized with task-specific priors through fully self-supervised meta-learning on either simulated or real-world data. In extensive experiments including over 480 reconstructions of simulated and clinical MRI brain data from different centers, we prove the utility of our method in cases of severe subject motion and image artifacts. Our results demonstrate improvements in reconstruction quality, especially in the presence of severe motion, compared to state-of-the-art methods, and up to 50% reduction in reconstruction time.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.",

However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 53.4$\\%$ to 91.5$\\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward.

However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.",

As the first cohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to immersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving communication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by gaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from both human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked harassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100 recent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the study reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for online safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing Gen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for youth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems, human moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers; and (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability. Findings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth communication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults fail to understand their digital world. This study combines the insight of a Gen Alpha researcher with systematic academic analysis to address critical digital safety challenges.",

Critically, optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space. The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models, and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the HM-POMDP, and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and generalize better to unseen POMDPs, and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of over a hundred thousand environments.",

    "abstract": "Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has enabled robots to understand natural language and reason about the semantics in their environments. However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain, handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing several promising directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have demonstrated significant advantages in computer vision tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships through self-attention. However, existing position encoding techniques, which are largely borrowed from natural language processing, fail to effectively capture semantic-aware positional relationships between image patches. Traditional approaches like absolute position encoding and relative position encoding primarily focus on 1D linear position relationship, often neglecting the semantic similarity between distant yet contextually related patches. These limitations hinder model generalization, translation equivariance, and the ability to effectively handle repetitive or structured patterns in images. In this paper, we propose 2-Dimensional Semantic-Aware Position Encoding ($\\text{SaPE}^2$), a novel position encoding method with semantic awareness that dynamically adapts position representations by leveraging local content instead of fixed linear position relationship or spatial coordinates. Our method enhances the model's ability to generalize across varying image resolutions and scales, improves translation equivariance, and better aggregates features for visually similar but spatially distant patches. By integrating $\\text{SaPE}^2$ into vision transformers, we bridge the gap between position encoding and perceptual similarity, thereby improving performance on computer vision tasks.",

This development has raised concerns that their use may circumvent essential learning processes and compromise the integrity of established assessment formats. In physics education, where problem solving plays a central role in instruction and assessment, it is therefore essential to understand the physics-specific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Such understanding is key to informing responsible and pedagogically sound approaches to integrating LLMs into instruction and assessment. This study therefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM (GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model (o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on a set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the correctness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic strengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this study indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate advanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on average outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little effect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently outperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark. Based on these findings, the study discusses implications for the design of summative and formative assessment in physics education, including how to uphold assessment integrity and support students in critically engaging with LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential for revolutionizing Customer Experience Management (CXM), particularly in contact center operations. However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism, failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise, or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency. To bridge this gap, we introduce CXMArena, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the foundation of our datasets-such as knowledge articles including product specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation. Building on this, we release CXMArena, which provides dedicated benchmarks targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with Integrated Tools. Our baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's difficulty: even state of the art embedding and generation models achieve only 68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1 score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over conventional techniques.",

    "abstract": "AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and creativity - they present a fundamental \"comfort-growth paradox\": AI's user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1) Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity. Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and continuous learning.",

However, established methods for computing counterfactuals typically focus on one-step decision-making, and are not directly applicable to sequential decision-making tasks. This paper fills this gap by introducing counterfactual strategies for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). During MDP execution, a strategy decides which of the enabled actions (with known probabilistic effects) to execute next. Given an initial strategy that reaches an undesired outcome with a probability above some limit, we identify minimal changes to the initial strategy to reduce that probability below the limit. We encode such counterfactual strategies as solutions to non-linear optimization problems, and further extend our encoding to synthesize diverse counterfactual strategies. We evaluate our approach on four real-world datasets and demonstrate its practical viability in sophisticated sequential decision-making tasks.",

However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.",

However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Federated semantic segmentation enables pixel-level classification in images through collaborative learning while maintaining data privacy. However, existing research commonly overlooks the fine-grained class relationships within the semantic space when addressing heterogeneous problems, particularly domain shift. This oversight results in ambiguities between class representation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated segmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS. Specifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and global-level class representations. On the server side, the uploaded class exemplars are leveraged to model class prototypes, which supervise global branch of clients, ensuring alignment with global-level representation. On the client side, we incorporate an adversarial mechanism to harmonize contributions of global and local branches, leading to consistent output. Moreover, multilevel contrastive losses are employed on both sides to enforce consistency between two-level representations in the same semantic space. Extensive experiments on several driving scene segmentation datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving average segmentation accuracy and effectively addressing the class-consistency representation problem.",

The current study describes a radiology software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI) designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.\n  Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and hospital-wide radiology information systems. A prospective pragmatic investigation was deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n  Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model, significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873). Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the value of real-time radiologist feedback.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. In spite of the promise, they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design process of quantum circuits, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and hardware noise. To address these challenges, we introduce $\\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, an improved framework that combines tensor network methods with RL for QAS. By warm-starting the QAS with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits and accelerates the convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces classical optimizer function evaluation by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to 98$\\%$, and can achieve 50$\\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems, far exceeding the $<$1$\\%$ rates of baseline. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of an 8-qubit system. Furthermore, TensorRL-QAS demonstrates effectiveness on systems on 20-qubit quantum systems, positioning it as a state-of-the-art quantum circuit discovery framework for near-term hardware and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Following the pandemic, customers, preference for using e-commerce has accelerated. Since much information is available in multiple reviews (sometimes running in thousands) for a single product, it can create decision paralysis for the buyer. This scenario disempowers the consumer, who cannot be expected to go over so many reviews since its time consuming and can confuse them. Various commercial tools are available, that use a scoring mechanism to arrive at an adjusted score. It can alert the user to potential review manipulations. This paper proposes a framework that fine-tunes a generative pre-trained transformer to understand these reviews better. Furthermore, using \"common-sense\" to make better decisions. These models have more than 13 billion parameters. To fine-tune the model for our requirement, we use the curie engine from generative pre-trained transformer (GPT3). By using generative models, we are introducing abstractive summarization. Instead of using a simple extractive method of summarizing the reviews. This brings out the true relationship between the reviews and not simply copy-paste. This introduces an element of \"common sense\" for the user and helps them to quickly make the right decisions. The user is provided the pros and cons of the processed reviews. Thus the user/customer can take their own decisions.",

Traditionally, this process requires training and evaluation of each network, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Zero-cost proxies estimate performance without training, serving as an alternative to traditional training. However, recent proxies often lack generalization across diverse scenarios and provide only relative rankings rather than predicted accuracies. To address these limitations, we propose GreenFactory, an ensemble of zero-cost proxies that leverages a random forest regressor to combine multiple predictors' strengths and directly predict model test accuracy. We evaluate GreenFactory on NATS-Bench, achieving robust results across multiple datasets. Specifically, GreenFactory achieves high Kendall correlations on NATS-Bench-SSS, indicating substantial agreement between its predicted scores and actual performance: 0.907 for CIFAR-10, 0.945 for CIFAR-100, and 0.920 for ImageNet-16-120. Similarly, on NATS-Bench-TSS, we achieve correlations of 0.921 for CIFAR-10, 0.929 for CIFAR-100, and 0.908 for ImageNet-16-120, showcasing its reliability in both search spaces.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is a key tool for Android malware detection, effectively identifying malicious patterns in apps. However, ML-based detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks, where small, crafted changes bypass detection. Despite progress in adversarial defenses, the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks in binary-constrained domains limits understanding of their robustness. We introduce two key contributions. First, Prioritized Binary Rounding, a technique to convert continuous perturbations into binary feature spaces while preserving high attack success and low perturbation size. Second, the sigma-binary attack, a novel adversarial method for binary domains, designed to achieve attack goals with minimal feature changes. Experiments on the Malscan dataset show that sigma-binary outperforms existing attacks and exposes key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art defenses. Defenses equipped with adversary detectors, such as KDE, DLA, DNN+, and ICNN, exhibit significant brittleness, with attack success rates exceeding 90% using fewer than 10 feature modifications and reaching 100% with just 20. Adversarially trained defenses, including AT-rFGSM-k, AT-MaxMA, improves robustness under small budgets but remains vulnerable to unrestricted perturbations, with attack success rates of 99.45% and 96.62%, respectively. Although PAD-SMA demonstrates strong robustness against state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks by maintaining an attack success rate below 16.55%, the sigma-binary attack significantly outperforms these methods, achieving a 94.56% success rate under unrestricted perturbations. These findings highlight the critical need for precise method like sigma-binary to expose hidden vulnerabilities in existing defenses and support the development of more resilient malware detection systems.",

    "abstract": "AI safety systems face the dual-use dilemma. It is unclear whether to answer dual-use requests, since the same query could be either harmless or harmful depending on who made it and why. To make better decisions, such systems would need to examine requests' real-world context, but currently, they lack access to this information. Instead, they sometimes end up making arbitrary choices that result in refusing legitimate queries and allowing harmful ones, which hurts both utility and safety. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework based on access controls where only verified users can access dual-use outputs. We describe the framework's components, analyse its feasibility, and explain how it addresses both over-refusals and under-refusals. While only a high-level proposal, our work takes the first step toward giving model providers more granular tools for managing dual-use content. Such tools would enable users to access more capabilities without sacrificing safety, and offer regulators new options for targeted policies.",

Despite extensive studies on scaling behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.",

    "abstract": "The computer vision and image processing research community has been involved in standardizing video data communications for the past many decades, leading to standards such as AVC, HEVC, VVC, AV1, AV2, etc. However, recent groundbreaking works have focused on employing deep learning-based techniques to replace the traditional video codec pipeline to a greater affect. Neural video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However, their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural video codec space.",

FedIDA supports multiple sensitive attributes and heterogeneous data distributions without altering the convergence behavior of the underlying FL algorithm. We provide theoretical analysis establishing fairness improvement bounds using Lipschitz continuity and concentration inequalities, and show that FedIDA reduces the variance of fairness metrics across test sets. Empirical results on both benchmark and real-world clinical datasets confirm that FedIDA consistently improves fairness while maintaining competitive predictive performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for equitable and privacy-preserving modeling in healthcare.

The impact of the universalization principle is also examined, with results showing that large models can achieve sustainable cooperation, with or without the principle, while smaller models fail without it. In addition, we provide multiple extensions to explore the applicability of the framework to new settings. We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario using Japanese instructions, and explore an \"inverse environment\" where agents must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages, offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative tasks. Moreover, the experiment involving heterogeneous multi-agent systems demonstrates that high-performing models can influence lower-performing ones to adopt similar behaviors. This finding has significant implications for other agent-based applications, potentially enabling more efficient use of computational resources and contributing to the development of more effective cooperative AI systems.",

However, existing KT models predominantly focus on data from a single course, limiting their ability to capture a comprehensive understanding of learners' knowledge states. In this paper, we propose TransKT, a contrastive cross-course knowledge tracing method that leverages concept graph guided knowledge transfer to model the relationships between learning behaviors across different courses, thereby enhancing knowledge state estimation. Specifically, TransKT constructs a cross-course concept graph by leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM) prompts to establish implicit links between related concepts across different courses. This graph serves as the foundation for knowledge transfer, enabling the model to integrate and enhance the semantic features of learners' interactions across courses. Furthermore, TransKT includes an LLM-to-LM pipeline for incorporating summarized semantic features, which significantly improves the performance of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) used for knowledge transfer. Additionally, TransKT employs a contrastive objective that aligns single-course and cross-course knowledge states, thereby refining the model's ability to provide a more robust and accurate representation of learners' overall knowledge states.",

    "abstract": "Zero- and few-shot visual anomaly segmentation relies on powerful vision-language models that detect unseen anomalies using manually designed textual prompts. However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised reconstruction networks using self-attention transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-class (unified) anomaly detection with a single model. However, these self-attention reconstruction models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec, BTAD, and VisA. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/gaobb/OneNIP.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a practical and challenging task due to the scarcity of anomaly samples in industrial inspection. Some existing anomaly detection methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen) method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks simultaneously, \\eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\\% and 1.5\\% improvement in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively.

    "abstract": "Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $ρ(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.",

Yet, most rely on either. Semi-Structured Knowledge Bases (SKBs) bridge this gap by linking unstructured content to nodes within structured data. In this work, we present Autofocus-Retriever (AF-Retriever), a modular framework for SKB-based, multi-hop question answering. It combines structural and textual retrieval through novel integration steps and optimizations, achieving the best zero- and one-shot results across all three STaRK QA benchmarks, which span diverse domains and evaluation metrics.\n  AF-Retriever's average first-hit rate surpasses the second-best method by 32.1%. Its performance is driven by (1) leveraging exchangeable large language models (LLMs) to extract entity attributes and relational constraints for both parsing and reranking the top-k answers, (2) vector similarity search for ranking both extracted entities and final answers, (3) a novel incremental scope expansion procedure that prepares for the reranking on a configurable amount of suitable candidates that fulfill the given constraints the most, and (4) a hybrid retrieval strategy that reduces error susceptibility.\n  In summary, while constantly adjusting the focus like an optical autofocus, AF-Retriever delivers a configurable amount of answer candidates in four constraint-driven retrieval steps, which are then supplemented and ranked through four additional processing steps. An ablation study and a detailed error analysis, including a comparison of three different LLM reranking strategies, provide component-level insights.

Based on the surveyed data, we explored four key areas: the frequency and application scenarios of AI use among engineering students, its impact on students' learning and performance, commonly encountered challenges in using generative AI, and future prospects for its adoption in engineering education. The results showed that more than half of the participants reported a positive impact of generative AI on their learning efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half believing it also enhanced their independent thinking. However, despite acknowledging improved study efficiency, many felt their actual academic performance remained largely unchanged and expressed concerns about the accuracy and domain-specific reliability of generative AI. Our findings provide a first-hand insight into the current benefits and challenges generative AI brings to students, particularly Chinese engineering students, while offering several recommendations, especially from the students' perspective, for effectively integrating generative AI into engineering education.",

    "abstract": "Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis, energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process. However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 Å, representing an 32.96% improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models. Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we successfully identified Li\\(_2\\)AuH\\(_6\\) as a conventional BCS superconductor with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials science.",

    "abstract": "The core challenge in Camouflage Object Detection (COD) lies in the indistinguishable similarity between targets and backgrounds in terms of color, texture, and shape. This causes existing methods to either lose edge details (such as hair-like fine structures) due to over-reliance on global semantic information or be disturbed by similar backgrounds (such as vegetation patterns) when relying solely on local features. We propose DRRNet, a four-stage architecture characterized by a \"context-detail-fusion-refinement\" pipeline to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce an Omni-Context Feature Extraction Module to capture global camouflage patterns and a Local Detail Extraction Module to supplement microstructural information for the full-scene context module. We then design a module for forming dual representations of scene understanding and structural awareness, which fuses panoramic features and local features across various scales. In the decoder, we also introduce a reverse refinement module that leverages spatial edge priors and frequency-domain noise suppression to perform a two-stage inverse refinement of the output. By applying two successive rounds of inverse refinement, the model effectively suppresses background interference and enhances the continuity of object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that DRRNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jerrySunning/DRRNet.",

Current LLM serving systems often employ a first-come-first-served scheduling strategy, which can lead to the \"head-of-line blocking\" problem. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to predict LLM inference times and apply a shortest job first scheduling strategy. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, predicting the inference latency is challenging. ELIS addresses this challenge by training a response length predictor for LLMs using the BGE model, an encoder-based state-of-the-art model. Additionally, we have devised the ISRTF scheduling strategy, an optimization of shortest remaining time first tailored to existing LLM iteration batching. To evaluate our work in an industrial setting, we simulate streams of requests based on our study of real-world user LLM serving trace records. Furthermore, we implemented ELIS as a cloud-native scheduler system on Kubernetes to evaluate its performance in production environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that ISRTF reduces the average job completion time by up to 19.6%.",

To resolve these limitations, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the fair $K$-means clustering objective function. The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii) optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility fair clustering in practice. Experiments show that FCA outperforms existing methods by (i) attaining a superior trade-off between fairness level and clustering utility, and (ii) achieving near-perfect fairness without numerical instability.",

The method fuses unsupervised KMeans clustering with RGB channel histogram modeling to achieve composite detection of structural anomalies and color mutation signals in key frames. The experiment takes an operation surveillance video occurring in an African country as a research sample, and successfully identifies multiple highly anomalous frames related to high-energy light sources, target presence, and reflective interference under the condition of no access to the original data. The results show that this method can be effectively used for tactical assassination warning, suspicious object screening and environmental drastic change monitoring with strong deployability and tactical interpretation value.

    "abstract": "Advance Care Planning (ACP) allows individuals to specify their preferred end-of-life life-sustaining treatments before they become incapacitated by injury or terminal illness (e.g., coma, cancer, dementia). While online ACP offers high accessibility, it lacks key benefits of clinical consultations, including personalized value exploration, immediate clarification of decision consequences. To bridge this gap, we conducted two formative studies: 1) shadowed and interviewed 3 ACP teams consisting of physicians, nurses, and social workers (18 patients total), and 2) interviewed 14 users of ACP websites. Building on these insights, we designed PreCare in collaboration with 6 ACP professionals. PreCare is a website with 3 AI-driven assistants designed to guide users through exploring personal values, gaining ACP knowledge, and supporting informed decision-making. A usability study (n=12) showed that PreCare achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) rating of excellent. A comparative evaluation (n=12) showed that PreCare's AI assistants significantly improved exploration of personal values, knowledge, and decisional confidence, and was preferred by 92% of participants.",

    "abstract": "Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous robotic systems become increasingly mature, users will want to specify missions at the level of intent rather than in low-level detail. Language is an expressive and intuitive medium for such mission specification. However, realizing language-guided robotic teams requires overcoming significant technical hurdles. Interpreting and realizing language-specified missions requires advanced semantic reasoning. Successful heterogeneous robots must effectively coordinate actions and share information across varying viewpoints. Additionally, communication between robots is typically intermittent, necessitating robust strategies that leverage communication opportunities to maintain coordination and achieve mission objectives. In this work, we present a first-of-its-kind system where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) are able to collaboratively accomplish missions specified in natural language while reacting to changes in specification on the fly. We leverage a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled planner to reason over semantic-metric maps that are built online and opportunistically shared between an aerial and a ground robot. We consider task-driven navigation in urban and rural areas. Our system must infer mission-relevant semantics and actively acquire information via semantic mapping. In both ground and air-ground teaming experiments, we demonstrate our system on seven different natural-language specifications at up to kilometer-scale navigation.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant progress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on bandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated audio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To address this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN), a novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU activation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This innovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce intricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN module for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution operations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and fidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator network using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and generated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions of the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M parameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both speech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of the DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers superior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its robustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics, and exhibits increased robustness in synthesized audio.",

Although scaling up model parameters with increasing volume of training data has progressively improved DNN capabilities, achieving complex cognitive abilities - such as understanding abstract concepts, reasoning, and adapting to novel scenarios, which are intrinsic to human cognition - remains a major challenge. In this study, we show that brain-in-the-loop supervised learning, utilizing a small set of brain signals, can effectively transfer human conceptual structures to DNNs, significantly enhancing their comprehension of abstract and even unseen concepts. Experimental results further indicate that the enhanced cognitive capabilities lead to substantial performance gains in challenging tasks, including few-shot/zero-shot learning and out-of-distribution recognition, while also yielding highly interpretable concept representations. These findings highlight that human-in-the-loop supervision can effectively augment the complex cognitive abilities of large models, offering a promising pathway toward developing more human-like cognitive abilities in artificial systems.",

Our primary contributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling stable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2) an attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%, 82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on personality stability.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in source code summarization have leveraged transformer-based pre-trained models, including Large Language Models of Code (LLMCs), to automate and improve the generation of code summaries. However, existing methods often focus on generating a single high-quality summary for a given source code, neglecting scenarios where the generated summary might be inadequate and alternative options are needed. In this paper, we introduce Variational Prefix Tuning (VPT), a novel approach that enhances pre-trained models' ability to generate diverse yet accurate sets of summaries, allowing the user to choose the most suitable one for the given source code. Our method integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework as a modular component into pre-trained models, enabling us to model the distribution of observed target summaries and sample continuous embeddings to be used as prefixes to steer the generation of diverse outputs during decoding. Importantly, we construct our method in a parameter-efficient manner, eliminating the need for expensive model retraining, especially when using LLMCs. Furthermore, we employ a bi-criteria reranking method to select a subset of generated summaries, optimizing both the diversity and the accuracy of the options presented to users. We present extensive experimental evaluations using widely used datasets and current state-of-the-art pre-trained code summarization models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its adaptability across models.",

We propose RT-Cache, a training-free retrieval-as-control pipeline that caches diverse image action trajectories in a unified vector memory and, at test time, embeds the current frame to retrieve and replay multi-step snippets, replacing per-step model calls. A hierarchical search keeps lookups sub-second at million scale, shifting cost from compute to storage and enabling real-time control on modest GPUs. Across real-robot tasks and large open logs, RT-Cache achieves higher success and lower completion time than strong retrieval baselines (approximately x2 higher success and ~30% faster in our settings), and a single-episode anchoring study shows immediate adaptation to a more complex, contact-rich task without fine-tuning. RT-Cache turns experience into an append-only memory, offering a simple, scalable path to few-shot deployment today and a foundation for multimodal keys and optional integration with high-level policies.

    "abstract": "Modern video super-resolution (VSR) systems based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require huge computational costs. The problem of feature redundancy is present in most models in many domains, but is rarely discussed in VSR. We experimentally observe that many features in VSR models are also similar to each other, so we propose to use \"Ghost features\" to reduce this redundancy. We also analyze the so-called \"gradient disappearance\" phenomenon generated by the conventional recurrent convolutional network (RNN) model, and combine the Ghost module with RNN to complete the modeling on time series. The current frame is used as input to the model together with the next frame, the output of the previous frame and the hidden state. Extensive experiments on several benchmark models and datasets show that the PSNR and SSIM of our proposed modality are improved to some extent. Some texture details in the video are also better preserved.",

    "abstract": "Prompt leakage poses a compelling security and privacy threat in LLM\napplications. Leakage of system prompts may compromise intellectual property,\nand act as adversarial reconnaissance for an attacker. A systematic evaluation\nof prompt leakage threats and mitigation strategies is lacking, especially for\nmulti-turn LLM interactions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLM\nvulnerabilities against prompt leakage for 10 closed- and open-source LLMs,\nacross four domains. We design a unique threat model which leverages the LLM\nsycophancy effect and elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) from 17.7%\nto 86.2% in a multi-turn setting. Our standardized setup further allows\ndissecting leakage of specific prompt contents such as task instructions and\nknowledge documents. We measure the mitigation effect of 7 black-box defense\nstrategies, along with finetuning an open-source model to defend against\nleakage attempts. We present different combination of defenses against our\nthreat model, including a cost analysis. Our study highlights key takeaways for\nbuilding secure LLM applications and provides directions for research in\nmulti-turn LLM interactions",

    "abstract": "Linking a claim to grounded references is a critical ability to fulfill human\ndemands for authentic and reliable information. Current studies are limited to\nspecific tasks like information retrieval or semantic matching, where the\nclaim-reference relationships are unique and fixed, while the referential\nknowledge linking (RKL) in real-world can be much more diverse and complex. In\nthis paper, we propose universal referential knowledge linking (URL), which\naims to resolve diversified referential knowledge linking tasks by one unified\nmodel. To this end, we propose a LLM-driven task-instructed representation\ncompression, as well as a multi-view learning approach, in order to effectively\nadapt the instruction following and semantic understanding abilities of LLMs to\nreferential knowledge linking. Furthermore, we also construct a new benchmark\nto evaluate ability of models on referential knowledge linking tasks across\ndifferent scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that universal RKL is challenging\nfor existing approaches, while the proposed framework can effectively resolve\nthe task across various scenarios, and therefore outperforms previous\napproaches by a large margin.",

For the secure functioning of Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS), it is imperative to manage such uncertainty adeptly. In this research,\nwe focus on the development of a vehicle's lateral control system using a\nmachine learning framework. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian Neural Network\n(BNN), a probabilistic learning model, to address uncertainty quantification.\nThis capability allows us to gauge the level of confidence or uncertainty in\nthe model's predictions. The BNN based controller is trained using simulated\ndata gathered from the vehicle traversing a single track and subsequently\ntested on various other tracks. We want to share two significant results:\nfirstly, the trained model demonstrates the ability to adapt and effectively\ncontrol the vehicle on multiple similar tracks. Secondly, the quantification of\nprediction confidence integrated into the controller serves as an early-warning\nsystem, signaling when the algorithm lacks confidence in its predictions and is\ntherefore susceptible to failure. By establishing a confidence threshold, we\ncan trigger manual intervention, ensuring that control is relinquished from the\nalgorithm when it operates outside of safe parameters.",

Reconfigurable\nArchitecture for Neuromorphic Computing (RANC) is one such tool that offers\nability to execute pre-trained Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models within a\nunified ecosystem through both software-based simulation and FPGA-based\nemulation. RANC has been utilized by the community with its flexible and highly\nparameterized design to study implementation bottlenecks, tune architectural\nparameters or modify neuron behavior based on application insights and study\nthe trade space on hardware performance and network accuracy. In designing\narchitectures for use in neuromorphic computing, there are an incredibly large\nnumber of configuration parameters such as number and precision of weights per\nneuron, neuron and axon counts per core, network topology, and neuron behavior.\nTo accelerate such studies and provide users with a streamlined productive\ndesign space exploration, in this paper we introduce the GPU-based\nimplementation of RANC. We summarize our parallelization approach and quantify\nthe speedup gains achieved with GPU-based tick-accurate simulations across\nvarious use cases. We demonstrate up to 780 times speedup compared to serial\nversion of the RANC simulator based on a 512 neuromorphic core MNIST inference\napplication.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on a variety\nof NLP tasks, and are being rapidly adopted in a wide range of use cases. It is\ntherefore of vital importance to holistically evaluate the factuality of their\ngenerated outputs, as hallucinations remain a challenging issue.\n  In this work, we focus on assessing LLMs' ability to recall factual knowledge\nlearned from pretraining, and the factors that affect this ability. To that\nend, we construct FACT-BENCH, a representative benchmark covering 20 domains,\n134 property types, 3 answer types, and different knowledge popularity levels.\nWe benchmark 31 models from 10 model families and provide a holistic assessment\nof their strengths and weaknesses. We observe that instruction-tuning hurts\nknowledge recall, as pretraining-only models consistently outperform their\ninstruction-tuned counterparts, and positive effects of model scaling, as\nlarger models outperform smaller ones for all model families. However, the best\nperformance from GPT-4 still represents a large gap with the upper-bound. We\nadditionally study the role of in-context exemplars using counterfactual\ndemonstrations, which lead to significant degradation of factual knowledge\nrecall for large models. By further decoupling model known and unknown\nknowledge, we find the degradation is attributed to exemplars that contradict a\nmodel's known knowledge, as well as the number of such exemplars. Lastly, we\nfine-tune LLaMA-7B in different settings of known and unknown knowledge. In\nparticular, fine-tuning on a model's known knowledge is beneficial, and\nconsistently outperforms fine-tuning on unknown and mixed knowledge. We will\nmake our benchmark publicly available.",

AFU has\nan actor but its critic updates are entirely independent from it. As a\nconsequence, the actor can be chosen freely. In the initial version, AFU-alpha,\nwe employ the same stochastic actor as in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), but we then\nstudy a simple failure mode of SAC and show how AFU can be modified to make\nactor updates less likely to become trapped in local optima, resulting in a\nsecond version of the algorithm, AFU-beta. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsample efficiency of both versions of AFU, marking it as the first model-free\noff-policy algorithm competitive with state-of-the-art actor-critic methods\nwhile departing from the actor-critic perspective.",

    "abstract": "The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant\ninformation from an external knowledge source enables large language models\n(LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document\ncollections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text\ncorpus, such as \"What are the main themes in the dataset?\", since this is\ninherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit\nretrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of\ntext indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these\ncontrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question\nanswering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of\nuser questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to\nbuild a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph\nfrom the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all\ngroups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is\nused to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again\nsummarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking\nquestions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG\nleads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the\ncomprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.",

LBKT achieves the\nbest performance on most benchmark datasets on the metrics of ACC and AUC.\nAdditionally, an ablation study is conducted to analyse the impact of each\ncomponent of LBKT's overall performance. Moreover, we used t-SNE as the\nvisualisation tool to demonstrate the model's embedding strategy.

    "abstract": "We introduce RetinaRegNet, a zero-shot image registration model designed to\nregister retinal images with minimal overlap, large deformations, and varying\nimage quality. RetinaRegNet addresses these challenges and achieves robust and\naccurate registration through the following steps. First, we extract features\nfrom the moving and fixed images using latent diffusion models. We then sample\nfeature points from the fixed image using a combination of the SIFT algorithm\nand random point sampling. For each sampled point, we identify its\ncorresponding point in the moving image using a 2D correlation map, which\ncomputes the cosine similarity between the diffusion feature vectors of the\npoint in the fixed image and all pixels in the moving image. Second, we\neliminate most incorrectly detected point correspondences (outliers) by\nenforcing an inverse consistency constraint, ensuring that correspondences are\nconsistent in both forward and backward directions. We further remove outliers\nwith large distances between corresponding points using a global transformation\nbased outlier detector. Finally, we implement a two-stage registration\nframework to handle large deformations. The first stage estimates a homography\ntransformation to achieve global alignment between the images, while the second\nstage uses a third-order polynomial transformation to estimate local\ndeformations. We evaluated RetinaRegNet on three retinal image registration\ndatasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser\nspeckle flowgraphy images. Our model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art\nmethods across all datasets. The accurate registration achieved by RetinaRegNet\nenables the tracking of eye disease progression, enhances surgical planning,\nand facilitates the evaluation of treatment efficacy.

Beyond the memory taken up by model weights, the\nmemory used by the KV cache rises linearly with sequence length, becoming a\nprimary bottleneck for inference. In this paper, we introduce an innovative\nmethod for optimizing the KV cache, which considerably minimizes its memory\nfootprint. Upon thorough investigation, we discover that in most Transformer\nmodels, (i) there is a striking similarity between adjacent tokens' query\nvectors, and (ii) the attention calculation of the current query can rely\nexclusively on the attention information of a small fraction of preceding\nqueries. Based on these observations, we present CORM, a KV cache eviction\npolicy that dynamically retains essential key-value pairs for inference without\nthe need for model fine-tuning. Our validation shows that CORM reduces the\ninference memory usage of KV cache by up to 70\\% with negligible performance\ndegradation across six tasks in LongBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nCORM is compatible with GQA for further compression rate.",

To\novercome the challenges, we investigate a new approach based on Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which has sparked interest across various\nmedical imaging tasks. By solving the challenges in (1) effectively adapting\nthe single-view CLIP for multi-view feature fusion and (2) efficiently\nfine-tuning this parameter-dense model with limited samples and computational\nresources, we introduce Mammo-CLIP, the first multi-modal framework to process\nmulti-view mammograms and corresponding simple texts. Mammo-CLIP uses an early\nfeature fusion strategy to learn multi-view relationships in four mammograms\nacquired from the CC and MLO views of the left and right breasts. To enhance\nlearning efficiency, plug-and-play adapters are added into CLIP image and text\nencoders for fine-tuning parameters and limiting updates to about 1% of the\nparameters. For framework evaluation, we assembled two datasets\nretrospectively. The first dataset, comprising 470 malignant and 479 benign\ncases, was used for few-shot fine-tuning and internal evaluation of the\nproposed Mammo-CLIP via 5-fold cross-validation. The second dataset, including\n60 malignant and 294 benign cases, was used to test generalizability of\nMammo-CLIP. Study results show that Mammo-CLIP outperforms the state-of-art\ncross-view transformer in AUC (0.841 vs. 0.817, 0.837 vs. 0.807) on both\ndatasets. It also surpasses previous two CLIP-based methods by 20.3% and 14.3%.\nThis study highlights the potential of applying the finetuned vision-language\nmodels for developing next-generation, image-text-based CAD schemes of breast\ncancer.",

The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed attack achieves successful attacks across various commonly used models\nand Google Vision API without any prior knowledge about the target model.\nAdditionally, the average cost of each attack is less than \\$ 1 dollars, posing\na significant threat to AI security.",

    "abstract": "Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning\ncapabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal\nabstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to\ndevelop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal\nhierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research\nchallenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This\nthesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space\nmodels (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic\nformalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address\nthese drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms\nfacilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as\nwell as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach\npermits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable\nof representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions\nand scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of\nuncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate\nthe stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its\npredictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with\nrelated neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive\nprocessing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate\nthat our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of\ncontemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions.

Recognizing the limitations posed by\nexisting video wire datasets, which are characterized by their small size, poor\nquality, and limited variety of scenes, we introduce a new VWI dataset with a\nnovel mask generation strategy, namely Wire Removal Video Dataset 2 (WRV2) and\nPseudo Wire-Shaped (PWS) Masks.

Building upon this, our research proposes the\nRedundancy-Aware Transformer (Raformer) method that addresses the unique\nchallenges of wire removal in video inpainting. Unlike conventional approaches\nthat indiscriminately process all frame patches, Raformer employs a novel\nstrategy to selectively bypass redundant parts, such as static background\nsegments devoid of valuable information for inpainting.

    "abstract": "Bayesian flow networks (BFNs) iteratively refine the parameters, instead of\nthe samples in diffusion models (DMs), of distributions at various noise levels\nthrough Bayesian inference. Owing to its differentiable nature, BFNs are\npromising in modeling both continuous and discrete data, while simultaneously\nmaintaining fast sampling capabilities. This paper aims to understand and\nenhance BFNs by connecting them with DMs through stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs). We identify the linear SDEs corresponding to the\nnoise-addition processes in BFNs, demonstrate that BFN's regression losses are\naligned with denoise score matching, and validate the sampler in BFN as a\nfirst-order solver for the respective reverse-time SDE. Based on these findings\nand existing recipes of fast sampling in DMs, we propose specialized solvers\nfor BFNs that markedly surpass the original BFN sampler in terms of sample\nquality with a limited number of function evaluations (e.g., 10) on both image\nand text datasets. Notably, our best sampler achieves an increase in speed of\n5~20 times for free. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ML-GSAI/BFN-Solver.",

These techniques facilitate the deletion of previously acquired\nknowledge without requiring extensive model retraining. However, they often\noverlook a critical issue: unlearning processes bias. This bias emerges from\ntwo main sources: (1) data-level bias, characterized by uneven data removal,\nand (2) algorithm-level bias, which leads to the contamination of the remaining\ndataset, thereby degrading model accuracy. In this work, we analyze the causal\nfactors behind the unlearning process and mitigate biases at both data and\nalgorithmic levels.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across\nmost benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance\ngains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater\ncomputation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use\nmeaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to\nsolve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without\nintermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler\ntokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We\nalso provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where\nfiller tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order\nformula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens\nneed not provide information about the intermediate computational steps\ninvolved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that\nadditional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token\nchoice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises\nconcerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden\ncomputations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought\ntokens.",

The battery is a key component that\ndetermines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an\nappropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust\ninspections.

The performance of\nthe hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset\ncomprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained\nfrom real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore\nwind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different\nprobabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in\nprobabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method.

These hybrid\nalgorithms, utilizing both classical and quantum components, are well-suited\nfor noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Though estimating exact gradients\nusing the parameter-shift rule to optimize the VQCs is realizable in NISQ\ndevices, they do not scale well for larger problem sizes. The computational\ncomplexity, in terms of the number of circuit evaluations required for gradient\nestimation by the parameter-shift rule, scales linearly with the number of\nparameters in VQCs. On the other hand, techniques that approximate the\ngradients of the VQCs, such as the simultaneous perturbation stochastic\napproximation (SPSA), do not scale with the number of parameters but struggle\nwith instability and often attain suboptimal solutions. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel gradient estimation approach called Guided-SPSA, which\nmeaningfully combines the parameter-shift rule and SPSA-based gradient\napproximation. The Guided-SPSA results in a 15% to 25% reduction in the number\nof circuit evaluations required during training for a similar or better\noptimality of the solution found compared to the parameter-shift rule.

This constraint in our perception allows us to\nrobustly generalize under distractions and to new compositions of perceivable\nconcepts. Transformers employ a similar notion of attention in their\narchitecture, but representation learning models with transformer backbones\nlike CLIP and DINO often fail to demonstrate robustness and compositionality.\nWe highlight a missing architectural prior: unlike human perception,\ntransformer encodings do not separately attend over individual concepts. In\nresponse, we propose SPARO, a read-out mechanism that partitions encodings into\nseparately-attended slots, each produced by a single attention head. Using\nSPARO with CLIP imparts an inductive bias that the vision and text modalities\nare different views of a shared compositional world with the same corresponding\nconcepts. Using SPARO, we demonstrate improvements on downstream recognition,\nrobustness, retrieval, and compositionality benchmarks with CLIP (up to +14%\nfor ImageNet, +4% for SugarCrepe), and on nearest neighbors and linear probe\nfor ImageNet with DINO (+3% each). We also showcase a powerful ability to\nintervene and select individual SPARO concepts to further improve downstream\ntask performance (up from +4% to +9% for SugarCrepe) and use this ability to\nstudy the robustness of SPARO's representation structure.

    "abstract": "Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT's) are a type of large language\nmachine learning model that are unusually adept at producing novel, and\ncoherent, natural language. In this study the ability of GPT models to generate\nnovel and correct versions, and notably very insecure versions, of\nimplementations of the cryptographic hash function SHA-1 is examined. The GPT\nmodels Llama-2-70b-chat-h, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, and zephyr-7b-alpha are\nused. The GPT models are prompted to re-write each function using a modified\nversion of the localGPT framework and langchain to provide word embedding\ncontext of the full source code and header files to the model, resulting in\nover 150,000 function re-write GPT output text blocks, approximately 50,000 of\nwhich were able to be parsed as C code and subsequently compiled. The generated\ncode is analyzed for being compilable, correctness of the algorithm, memory\nleaks, compiler optimization stability, and character distance to the reference\nimplementation. Remarkably, several generated function variants have a high\nimplementation security risk of being correct for some test vectors, but\nincorrect for other test vectors. Additionally, many function implementations\nwere not correct to the reference algorithm of SHA-1, but produced hashes that\nhave some of the basic characteristics of hash functions. Many of the function\nre-writes contained serious flaws such as memory leaks, integer overflows, out\nof bounds accesses, use of uninitialised values, and compiler optimization\ninstability. Compiler optimization settings and SHA-256 hash checksums of the\ncompiled binaries are used to cluster implementations that are equivalent but\nmay not have identical syntax - using this clustering over 100,000 novel and\ncorrect versions of the SHA-1 codebase were generated where each component C\nfunction of the reference implementation is different from the original code.",

    "abstract": "Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue\nof temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of\nhistorical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on\nutilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free\ninformation that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal\nInvariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search\nspace, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps\ninvariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based\nrecommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance\nnetwork using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance\nof the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based\nrecommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed\nonline. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can\ndistill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module\nusing shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the\noriginal model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework\nsignificantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing\nshifting data.",

    "abstract": "Systematic review (SR) is a popular research method in software engineering\n(SE). However, conducting an SR takes an average of 67 weeks. Thus, automating\nany step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs. Our\nobjective is to investigate if Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate\ntitle-abstract screening by simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and\nautomating title-abstract screening. We performed an experiment where humans\nscreened titles and abstracts for 20 papers with both original and simplified\nabstracts from a prior SR. The experiment with human screeners was reproduced\nwith GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks. We also\nstudied if different prompting techniques (Zero-shot (ZS), One-shot (OS),\nFew-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT)) improve the\nscreening performance of LLMs. Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt\nused in the LLM reproduction of screening leads to improved performance. Text\nsimplification did not increase the screeners' screening performance, but\nreduced the time used in screening. Screeners' scientific literacy skills and\nresearcher status predict screening performance. Some LLM and prompt\ncombinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. Our\nresults indicate that the GPT-4 LLM is better than its predecessor, GPT-3.5.\nAdditionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting.\nUsing LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not\nsignificantly improve human performance. Using LLMs to automate title-abstract\nscreening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate\nthan human screeners. To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of\nSRs, more research is needed. We recommend future SR studies publish\nreplication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive\nexperimenting with LLM screening.",

From a theoretical\nviewpoint, affordances bridge the gap between effect and action, providing a\nfunctional understanding of the connections between the actions of an agent and\nits environment in terms of the effects it can cause. In this study, we propose\na deep neural network model that unifies objects, actions, and effects into a\nsingle latent vector in a common latent space that we call the affordance\nspace. Using the affordance space, our system can generate effect trajectories\nwhen action and object are given and can generate action trajectories when\neffect trajectories and objects are given. Our model does not learn the\nbehavior of individual objects acted upon by a single agent. Still, rather, it\nforms a `shared affordance representation' spanning multiple agents and\nobjects, which we call Affordance Equivalence. Affordance Equivalence\nfacilitates not only action generalization over objects but also Cross\nEmbodiment transfer linking actions of different robots. In addition to the\nsimulation experiments that demonstrate the proposed model's range of\ncapabilities, we also showcase that our model can be used for direct imitation\nin real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Today mobile users learn and share their traffic observations via\ncrowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Waze). Yet such platforms simply cater to\nselfish users' myopic interests to recommend the shortest path, and do not\nencourage enough users to travel and learn other paths for future others. Prior\nstudies focus on one-shot congestion games without considering users'\ninformation learning, while our work studies how users learn and alter traffic\nconditions on stochastic paths in a human-in-the-loop manner. Our analysis\nshows that the myopic routing policy leads to severe under-exploration of\nstochastic paths. This results in a price of anarchy (PoA) greater than $2$, as\ncompared to the socially optimal policy in minimizing the long-term social\ncost. Besides, the myopic policy fails to ensure the correct learning\nconvergence about users' traffic hazard beliefs. To address this, we focus on\ninformational (non-monetary) mechanisms as they are easier to implement than\npricing. We first show that existing information-hiding mechanisms and\ndeterministic path-recommendation mechanisms in Bayesian persuasion literature\ndo not work with even (\\text{PoA}=\\infty). Accordingly, we propose a new\ncombined hiding and probabilistic recommendation (CHAR) mechanism to hide all\ninformation from a selected user group and provide state-dependent\nprobabilistic recommendations to the other user group. Our CHAR successfully\nensures PoA less than (\\frac{5}{4}), which cannot be further reduced by any\nother informational (non-monetary) mechanism. Besides the parallel network, we\nfurther extend our analysis and CHAR to more general linear path graphs with\nmultiple intermediate nodes, and we prove that the PoA results remain\nunchanged. Additionally, we carry out experiments with real-world datasets to\nfurther extend our routing graphs and verify the close-to-optimal performance\nof our CHAR.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely applied in various fields due to\ntheir energy-efficient and fast-inference capabilities. Applying SNNs to\nreinforcement learning (RL) can significantly reduce the computational resource\nrequirements for agents and improve the algorithm's performance under\nresource-constrained conditions. However, in current spiking reinforcement\nlearning (SRL) algorithms, the simulation results of multiple time steps can\nonly correspond to a single-step decision in RL. This is quite different from\nthe real temporal dynamics in the brain and also fails to fully exploit the\ncapacity of SNNs to process temporal data. In order to address this temporal\nmismatch issue and further take advantage of the inherent temporal dynamics of\nspiking neurons, we propose a novel temporal alignment paradigm (TAP) that\nleverages the single-step update of spiking neurons to accumulate historical\nstate information in RL and introduces gated units to enhance the memory\ncapacity of spiking neurons. Experimental results show that our method can\nsolve partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and multi-agent\ncooperation problems with similar performance as recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) but with about 50% power consumption.",

    "abstract": "Existing datasets for attribute value extraction (AVE) predominantly focus on\nexplicit attribute values while neglecting the implicit ones, lack product\nimages, are often not publicly available, and lack an in-depth human inspection\nacross diverse domains. To address these limitations, we present ImplicitAVE,\nthe first, publicly available multimodal dataset for implicit attribute value\nextraction. ImplicitAVE, sourced from the MAVE dataset, is carefully curated\nand expanded to include implicit AVE and multimodality, resulting in a refined\ndataset of 68k training and 1.6k testing data across five domains. We also\nexplore the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to implicit\nAVE, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for MLLMs on the ImplicitAVE\ndataset. Six recent MLLMs with eleven variants are evaluated across diverse\nsettings, revealing that implicit value extraction remains a challenging task\nfor MLLMs. The contributions of this work include the development and release\nof ImplicitAVE, and the exploration and benchmarking of various MLLMs for\nimplicit AVE, providing valuable insights and potential future research\ndirections.

However,\nutilizing a personalized large model in the on-device is inefficient, and\nsometimes limited due to computational cost. To tackle the problem, this paper\npresents the weights separation method to minimize on-device model weights\nusing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Moreover, some people speak\nmultiple languages in an utterance, as known as code-switching, the\npersonalized ASR model is necessary to address such cases. However, current\nmultilingual speech recognition models are limited to recognizing a single\nlanguage within each utterance. To tackle this problem, we propose\ncode-switching speech recognition models that incorporate fine-tuned\nmonolingual and multilingual speech recognition models. Additionally, we\nintroduce a gated low-rank adaptation(GLoRA) for parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning with minimal performance degradation. Our experiments, conducted on\nKorean-English code-switching datasets, demonstrate that fine-tuning speech\nrecognition models for code-switching surpasses the performance of traditional\ncode-switching speech recognition models trained from scratch. Furthermore,\nGLoRA enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning performance compared to\nconventional LoRA.",

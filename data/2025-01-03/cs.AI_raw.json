    "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for a new era of\nprogramming tools with both significant capabilities and risks, as the\ngenerated code lacks guarantees of correctness and reliability. Developers\nusing LLMs currently face the difficult task of optimizing, integrating, and\nmaintaining code generated by AI. We propose an embedded domain-specific\nlanguage (DSL), Pythoness, to address those challenges. In Pythoness,\ndevelopers program with LLMs at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than\ninteracting directly with generated code, developers using Pythoness operate at\nthe level of behavioral specifications when writing functions, classes, or an\nentire program. These specifications can take the form of unit tests and\nproperty-based tests, which may be expressed formally or in natural language.\nGuided by these specifications, Pythoness generates code that both passes the\ntests and can be continuously checked during execution. We posit that the\nPythoness approach lets developers harness the full potential of LLMs for code\ngeneration while substantially mitigating their inherent risks. We describe our\ncurrent prototype implementation of Pythoness and demonstrate that it can\nsuccessfully leverage a combination of tests and code generation to yield\nhigher quality code than specifications alone.",

    "abstract": "Street cats in urban areas often rely on human intervention for survival,\nleading to challenges in population control and welfare management. In April\n2023, Hello Inc., a Chinese urban mobility company, launched the Hello Street\nCat initiative to address these issues.

More intriguingly, LLMs\nhave demonstrated emergent abilities extending beyond their core functions,\nshowing proficiency in tasks like commonsense reasoning, code generation, and\narithmetic. This survey paper explores the foundational components, scaling\nmechanisms, and architectural strategies that drive these capabilities.\nEmphasizing models like GPT and LLaMA, we analyze the impact of exponential\ndata and computational growth on LLM performance, while also addressing the\ntrade-offs associated with scaling.

Based on\nthis, in this paper, we stand in the context of the era of large language\nmodels and provide a comprehensive review and discussion on the roadmap,\nrelated literature, and future directions of CSR. Specifically, we have\nconducted an exploration of the development path of how existing CSR utilizes\ninformation, from content features, graph relations, and domain information, to\nthe world knowledge possessed by large language models, aiming to provide new\ninsights for both the research and industrial communities on CSR. Related\nresources of cold-start recommendations are collected and continuously updated\nfor the community in\nhttps://github.com/YuanchenBei/Awesome-Cold-Start-Recommendation.",

However, there remains some unanswered questions on how to best\nutilize such models especially with very small fine-tuning cohorts. Methods: We\nutilized Med-BERT, an EHR-specific foundation model, and reformulated the\ndisease binary prediction task into a token prediction task and a next visit\nmask token prediction task to align with Med-BERT's pretraining task format in\norder to improve the accuracy of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) prediction in both\nfew-shot and fully supervised settings. Results: The reformulation of the task\ninto a token prediction task, referred to as Med-BERT-Sum, demonstrates\nslightly superior performance in both few-shot scenarios and larger data\nsamples. Furthermore, reformulating the prediction task as a Next Visit Mask\nToken Prediction task (Med-BERT-Mask) significantly outperforms the\nconventional Binary Classification (BC) prediction task (Med-BERT-BC) by 3% to\n7% in few-shot scenarios with data sizes ranging from 10 to 500 samples. These\nfindings highlight that aligning the downstream task with Med-BERT's\npretraining objectives substantially enhances the model's predictive\ncapabilities, thereby improving its effectiveness in predicting both rare and\ncommon diseases. Conclusion: Reformatting disease prediction tasks to align\nwith the pretraining of foundation models enhances prediction accuracy, leading\nto earlier detection and timely intervention.

This limitation hinders performance in tasks like audio or video\ncaptioning, where different semantic cues are needed. Addressing this challenge\nis crucial for creating more adaptable and versatile captioning frameworks\napplicable across diverse real-world contexts. In this work, we introduce a\nmethod to adapt captioning networks to the semantics of alternative settings,\nsuch as capturing audibility in audio captioning, where it is crucial to\ndescribe sounds and their sources. Our framework consists of two main\ncomponents: (i) a frozen captioning system incorporating a language model (LM),\nand (ii) a text classifier that guides the captioning system. The classifier is\ntrained on a dataset automatically generated by GPT-4, using tailored prompts\nspecifically designed to enhance key aspects of the generated captions.\nImportantly, the framework operates solely during inference, eliminating the\nneed for further training of the underlying captioning model. We evaluate the\nframework on various models and modalities, with a focus on audio captioning,\nand report promising results. Notably, when combined with an existing zero-shot\naudio captioning system, our framework improves its quality and sets\nstate-of-the-art performance in zero-shot audio captioning.",

Despite their\nsuccess, LVLMs still suffer from generating hallucinations in complex\ngeneration tasks, leading to inconsistencies between visual inputs and\ngenerated content. To address this issue, some approaches have introduced\ninference-time interventions, such as contrastive decoding and attention\nrectification, to reduce overreliance on language priors. However, these\napproaches overlook hallucinations stemming from spurious inter-modality\ncorrelations. In this paper, we propose an Inter-Modality Correlation\nCalibration Decoding (IMCCD) method to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs in a\ntraining-free manner. In this method, we design a Cross-Modal Value-Enhanced\nDecoding(CMVED) module to alleviate hallucination by a novel contrastive\ndecoding mechanism. During the estimation of distorted distribution, CMVED\nmasks the value vectors associated with significant cross-modal attention\nweights, which address both uni-modality overreliance and misleading\ninter-modality correlations. Additionally, a Content-Driven Attention\nRefinement(CDAR) module refines cross-modal attention weights, guiding LVLMs to\nfocus on important visual content. Experimental results on diverse\nhallucination benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over existing\nstate-of-the-art techniques in reducing hallucinations in LVLM text generation.\nOur code will be available at https://github.com/lijm48/IMCCD.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning technique that\nallows multiple entities to jointly train a model while preserving dataset\nprivacy. However, its distributed nature has raised various security concerns,\nwhich have been addressed by increasingly sophisticated defenses. These\nprotections utilize a range of data sources and metrics to, for example, filter\nout malicious model updates, ensuring that the impact of attacks is minimized\nor eliminated.\n  This paper explores the feasibility of designing a generic attack method\ncapable of installing backdoors in FL while evading a diverse array of\ndefenses. Specifically, we focus on an attacker strategy called MIGO, which\naims to produce model updates that subtly blend with legitimate ones. The\nresulting effect is a gradual integration of a backdoor into the global model,\noften ensuring its persistence long after the attack concludes, while\ngenerating enough ambiguity to hinder the effectiveness of defenses.\n  MIGO was employed to implant three types of backdoors across five datasets\nand different model architectures. The results demonstrate the significant\nthreat posed by these backdoors, as MIGO consistently achieved exceptionally\nhigh backdoor accuracy (exceeding 90%) while maintaining the utility of the\nmain task. Moreover, MIGO exhibited strong evasion capabilities against ten\ndefenses, including several state-of-the-art methods. When compared to four\nother attack strategies, MIGO consistently outperformed them across most\nconfigurations. Notably, even in extreme scenarios where the attacker controls\njust 0.1% of the clients, the results indicate that successful backdoor\ninsertion is possible if the attacker can persist for a sufficient number of\nrounds.",

There is also growing interest in adapting this capability to\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs). Given that MLLMs handle more complex\ndata semantics across different modalities, it is intuitively more challenging\nto implement multimodal slow-thinking systems.\n  To address this issue, in this paper, we explore a straightforward approach\nby fine-tuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual long-form thought\ndata, resulting in a multimodal slow-thinking system, Virgo (Visual reasoning\nwith long thought). We find that these long-form reasoning processes, expressed\nin natural language, can be effectively transferred to MLLMs. Moreover, it\nseems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual\nreasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs. While this\nwork is preliminary, it demonstrates that slow-thinking capacities are\nfundamentally associated with the language model component, which can be\ntransferred across modalities or domains.

DRL strategies are better suited than traditional\nrule-based methods for handling complex, dynamic, and unpredictable driving\nenvironments due to their adaptivity.

This survey reviews\nthe application of DRL algorithms in autonomous driving across typical\nscenarios, summarizing road features and recent advancements. The scenarios\ninclude highways, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, and unsignalized intersections.\nFurthermore, DRL-based algorithms are evaluated based on five rationale\ncriteria: driving safety, driving efficiency, training efficiency,\nunselfishness, and interpretability (DDTUI).

    "abstract": "To ease the expensive measurements during configuration tuning, it is natural\nto build a surrogate model as the replacement of the system, and thereby the\nconfiguration performance can be cheaply evaluated. Yet, a stereotype therein\nis that the higher the model accuracy, the better the tuning result would be.\nThis \"accuracy is all\" belief drives our research community to build more and\nmore accurate models and criticize a tuner for the inaccuracy of the model\nused. However, this practice raises some previously unaddressed questions,\ne.g., Do those somewhat small accuracy improvements reported in existing work\nreally matter much to the tuners? What role does model accuracy play in the\nimpact of tuning quality? To answer those related questions, we conduct one of\nthe largest-scale empirical studies to date-running over the period of 13\nmonths 24*7-that covers 10 models, 17 tuners, and 29 systems from the existing\nworks while under four different commonly used metrics, leading to 13,612 cases\nof investigation. Surprisingly, our key findings reveal that the accuracy can\nlie: there are a considerable number of cases where higher accuracy actually\nleads to no improvement in the tuning outcomes (up to 58% cases under certain\nsetting), or even worse, it can degrade the tuning quality (up to 24% cases\nunder certain setting). We also discover that the chosen models in most\nproposed tuners are sub-optimal and that the required % of accuracy change to\nsignificantly improve tuning quality varies according to the range of model\naccuracy. Deriving from the fitness landscape analysis, we provide in-depth\ndiscussions of the rationale behind, offering several lessons learned as well\nas insights for future opportunities. Most importantly, this work poses a clear\nmessage to the community: we should take one step back from the natural\n\"accuracy is all\" belief for model-based configuration tuning.",

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning\nmodels require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the\nincorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy.\nExisting approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in\ncapturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while\nvision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage\ngeneral knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model\ncollaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively\nintegrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is\nto decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected\nquestion-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is\nemployed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis,\nanswering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an\nLLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and\nsynthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond\nits role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to\nenhance its domain-specific capabilities.

However,\ncultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the\nmisrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and\nthe oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe\nconsequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM\nfor cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been\na significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in\nthis area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs\nin generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query\ntasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the\nknowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine\nboth the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts.\nUsing both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze\nthe cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are\nconcerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural\nmisalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment\nwith key cultural values. Beyond these findings, this paper introduces a\nbenchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation workflow that can serve as a\nvaluable resource for future research aimed at enhancing the cultural\nsensitivity and reliability of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Deep clustering is an essential task in modern artificial intelligence,\naiming to partition a set of data samples into a given number of homogeneous\ngroups (i.e., clusters). Even though many Deep Neural Network (DNN) backbones\nand clustering strategies have been proposed for the task, achieving\nincreasingly improved performance, deep clustering remains very challenging due\nto the lack of accurately labeled samples. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach of deep clustering via community detection. It initializes clustering\nby detecting many communities, and then gradually expands clusters by community\nmerging. Compared with the existing clustering strategies, community detection\nfactors in the new perspective of cluster network analysis. As a result, it has\nthe inherent benefit of high pseudo-label purity, which is critical to the\nperformance of self-supervision. We have validated the efficacy of the proposed\napproach on benchmark image datasets. Our extensive experiments have shown that\nit can effectively improve the SOTA performance. Our ablation study also\ndemonstrates that the new network perspective can effectively improve community\npseudo-label purity, resulting in improved clustering performance.",

    "abstract": "Existing legal frameworks on AI rely on training compute thresholds as a\nproxy to identify potentially-dangerous AI models and trigger increased\nregulatory attention. In the United States, Section 4.2(a) of Executive Order\n14110 instructs the Secretary of Commerce to require extensive reporting from\ndevelopers of AI models above a certain training compute threshold. In the\nEuropean Union, Article 51 of the AI Act establishes a presumption that AI\nmodels above a certain compute threshold have high impact capabilities and\nhence pose systemic risk, thus subjecting their developers to several\nobligations including capability evaluations, reporting, and incident\nmonitoring. In this paper, we examine some enhancement techniques that are\ncapable of decreasing training compute usage while preserving, or even\nincreasing, model capabilities. Since training compute thresholds rely on\ntraining compute as a metric and trigger for increased regulatory attention,\nthese capability-enhancing and compute-saving techniques could constitute a\nlegal loophole to existing training compute thresholds. In particular, we\nconcentrate on four illustrative techniques (fine-tuning, model reuse, model\nexpansion, and above compute-optimal inference compute) with the goal of\nfurthering the conversation about their implications on training compute\nthresholds as a legal mechanism and advancing policy recommendations that could\naddress the relevant legal loopholes.",

    "abstract": "Unlike traditional Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Audio-Visual Speech\nRecognition (AVSR) takes audio and visual signals simultaneously to infer the\ntranscription. Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can\nbe effectively used for Generative Error Correction (GER) in ASR by predicting\nthe best transcription from ASR-generated N-best hypotheses. However, these\nLLMs lack the ability to simultaneously understand audio and visual, making the\nGER approach challenging to apply in AVSR. In this work, we propose a novel GER\nparadigm for AVSR, termed AVGER, that follows the concept of ``listening and\nseeing again''. Specifically, we first use the powerful AVSR system to read the\naudio and visual signals to get the N-Best hypotheses, and then use the\nQ-former-based Multimodal Synchronous Encoder to read the audio and visual\ninformation again and convert them into an audio and video compression\nrepresentation respectively that can be understood by LLM. Afterward, the\naudio-visual compression representation and the N-Best hypothesis together\nconstitute a Cross-modal Prompt to guide the LLM in producing the best\ntranscription. In addition, we also proposed a Multi-Level Consistency\nConstraint training criterion, including logits-level, utterance-level and\nrepresentations-level, to improve the correction accuracy while enhancing the\ninterpretability of audio and visual compression representations. The\nexperimental results on the LRS3 dataset show that our method outperforms\ncurrent mainstream AVSR systems. The proposed AVGER can reduce the Word Error\nRate (WER) by 24% compared to them.

Large Language Models (LLMs), now a pervasive technology in our\neveryday lives, can cause extensive harm when prone to generating toxic\nresponses. The standard way to address this issue is to align the LLM, which,\nhowever, dampens the issue without constituting a definitive solution.\nTherefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for\ndetecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present\nEvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity,\nproviding a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards\ntoxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an\niterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the\nSystem Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward\nhigher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on\nan existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative\nempirical evaluation using four state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects\nhaving increasing complexity (7-13 billion parameters). Our quantitative\nevaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of\nEvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated\ndatasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment\nengages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the\nperceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions.\nResults indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level,\nis significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to\n1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks).\nFurthermore, EvoTox yields a limited cost overhead (from 22% to 35% on\naverage).",

However, obtaining correct annotations is\nextremely hard if not impossible for large-scale X-ray images, where item\noverlapping is ubiquitous.As a result, X-ray images are easily contaminated\nwith noisy annotations, leading to performance deterioration of existing\nmethods.In this paper, we address the challenging problem of training a robust\nprohibited item detector under noisy annotations (including both category noise\nand bounding box noise) from a novel perspective of data augmentation, and\npropose an effective label-aware mixed patch paste augmentation method\n(Mix-Paste). Specifically, for each item patch, we mix several item patches\nwith the same category label from different images and replace the original\npatch in the image with the mixed patch. In this way, the probability of\ncontaining the correct prohibited item within the generated image is increased.\nMeanwhile, the mixing process mimics item overlapping, enabling the model to\nlearn the characteristics of X-ray images. Moreover, we design an item-based\nlarge-loss suppression (LLS) strategy to suppress the large losses\ncorresponding to potentially positive predictions of additional items due to\nthe mixing operation. We show the superiority of our method on X-ray datasets\nunder noisy annotations. In addition, we evaluate our method on the noisy\nMS-COCO dataset to showcase its generalization ability.

Humans infer\nothers' thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad\ncontextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words,\nhuman ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life\nstories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing\nbenchmarks for evaluating machines' ToM capabilities, due to their usage of\nshort narratives without global context, especially personal background of\ncharacters. In this paper, we verify the importance of comprehensive contextual\nunderstanding about personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of\nLLMs in such complex scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce CharToM\nbenchmark, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic\nnovels.

We first observe that the existing agent training corpus\nexhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to\ngeneralize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting\nerrors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while.

While most deep learning-based methods\nhave achieved good results, they often struggle to balance performance across\nsmall and large-scale datasets due to the inherent limitations of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and Transformer. In this paper, we introduce VidFormer,\na novel end-to-end framework that integrates 3-Dimension Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (3DCNN) and Transformer models for rPPG tasks. Initially, we conduct an\nanalysis of the traditional skin reflection model and subsequently introduce an\nenhanced model for the reconstruction of rPPG signals.

To enhance the spatiotemporal feature\nextraction capabilities of VidFormer, we incorporate temporal-spatial attention\nmechanisms tailored for both 3DCNN and Transformer. Additionally, we design a\nmodule to facilitate information exchange and fusion between the 3DCNN and\nTransformer.

Although recent studies have\ndevoted considerable effort to the post-hoc alignment of LVLMs, the inner\nsafety mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we discover that\ninternal activations of LVLMs during the first token generation can effectively\nidentify malicious prompts across different attacks. This inherent safety\nperception is governed by sparse attention heads, which we term ``safety\nheads.\" Further analysis reveals that these heads act as specialized shields\nagainst malicious prompts; ablating them leads to higher attack success rates,\nwhile the model's utility remains unaffected. By locating these safety heads\nand concatenating their activations, we construct a straightforward but\npowerful malicious prompt detector that integrates seamlessly into the\ngeneration process with minimal extra inference overhead. Despite its simple\nstructure of a logistic regression model, the detector surprisingly exhibits\nstrong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Although some progress has been\nmade, there is still a considerable performance gap between the label-efficient\nmethods and fully-supervised one, which can be attributed to the uncertainty\nnature of these weak labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel weak\nannotation method coupled with its learning framework EAUWSeg to eliminate the\nannotation uncertainty. Specifically, we first propose the Bounded Polygon\nAnnotation (BPAnno) by simply labeling two polygons for a lesion. Then, the\ntailored learning mechanism that explicitly treat bounded polygons as two\nseparated annotations is proposed to learn invariant feature by providing\nadversarial supervision signal for model training. Subsequently, a\nconfidence-auxiliary consistency learner incorporates with a\nclassification-guided confidence generator is designed to provide reliable\nsupervision signal for pixels in uncertain region by leveraging the feature\npresentation consistency across pixels within the same category as well as\nclass-specific information encapsulated in bounded polygons annotation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that EAUWSeg outperforms existing\nweakly-supervised segmentation methods. Furthermore, compared to\nfully-supervised counterparts, the proposed method not only delivers superior\nperformance but also costs much less annotation workload. This underscores the\nsuperiority and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of machine\nlearning tasks by addressing data scarcity and improving generalization.\nHowever, generating time series data presents unique challenges. A model must\nnot only learn a probability distribution that reflects the real data\ndistribution but also capture the conditional distribution at each time step to\npreserve the inherent temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce AVATAR, a framework that combines Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE) with\nAutoregressive Learning to achieve both objectives. Specifically, our technique\nintegrates the autoencoder with a supervisor and introduces a novel supervised\nloss to assist the decoder in learning the temporal dynamics of time series\ndata. Additionally, we propose another innovative loss function, termed\ndistribution loss, to guide the encoder in more efficiently aligning the\naggregated posterior of the autoencoder's latent representation with a prior\nGaussian distribution. Furthermore, our framework employs a joint training\nmechanism to simultaneously train all networks using a combined loss, thereby\nfulfilling the dual objectives of time series generation.

PersonaAI combines the scalability of RAG with the\nefficiency of prompt-engineered LLAMA3, offering a lightweight, sustainable\nalternative to traditional large language model (LLM) training methods. The\nsystem's novel approach to data collection, utilizing real-time user\ninteractions via a mobile app, ensures enhanced context relevance while\nmaintaining user privacy. By open-sourcing our implementation, we aim to foster\nadaptability and community-driven development.\n  PersonaAI demonstrates how AI can transform interactions by merging\nefficiency, scalability, and personalization, making it a significant step\nforward in the future of digital avatars and personalized AI.",

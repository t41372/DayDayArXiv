    "abstract": "A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch\nTheorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization\nwithout further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which\nexplain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor.\nDespite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning\nonly minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity\nthrough regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection\nbetween Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain\nsequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past\nobservations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token\nprediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a\ndata compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this\nloss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity\nof the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the\nempirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account\nof in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current\nin-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved.

Notably, our method is easy to implement and\nrequires a small number of new trainable parameters with minimal impact on\nmodel performance.

In contrast to typical neural\nnetwork modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex\nparameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex\nparameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step\ntowards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex\ndiagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in\norder for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher\ndimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM.\nSecondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to\nexpress a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the\nreal SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in\npractice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with\nmoderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a\npotential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new\narchitectural feature yielding state of the art performance.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation\nlearning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and\nlocomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict\ncontrols or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable\nproperty of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability\ncomes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further,\nthere is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion\nPolicy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate\ngreater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these\nmodels at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a\nmethod that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic\ntasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration\ntrajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a\nhypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to\nlearn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors\nof the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the\nbenefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires\nfewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD\nachieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while\nusing models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD\ngenerates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in\nlong action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.",

    "abstract": "To validate the second-by-second dynamics of turbines in field experiments,\nit is necessary to accurately reconstruct the winds going into the turbine.\nCurrent time-resolved inflow reconstruction techniques estimate wind behavior\nin unobserved regions using relatively simple spectral-based models of the\natmosphere. Here, we develop a technique for time-resolved inflow\nreconstruction that is rooted in a large-eddy simulation model of the\natmosphere. Our \"large-eddy reconstruction\" technique blends observations and\natmospheric model information through a diffusion model machine learning\nalgorithm, allowing us to generate probabilistic ensembles of reconstructions\nfor a single 10-min observational period. Our generated inflows can be used\ndirectly by aeroelastic codes or as inflow boundary conditions in a large-eddy\nsimulation. We verify the second-by-second reconstruction capability of our\ntechnique in three synthetic field campaigns, finding positive Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient values (0.20>r>0.85) between ground-truth and\nreconstructed streamwise velocity, as well as smaller positive correlation\ncoefficient values for unobserved fields (spanwise velocity, vertical velocity,\nand temperature). We validate our technique in three real-world case studies by\ndriving large-eddy simulations with reconstructed inflows and comparing to\nindependent inflow measurements. The reconstructions are visually similar to\nmeasurements, follow desired power spectra properties, and track\nsecond-by-second behavior (0.25 > r > 0.75).",

    "abstract": "An intriguing property of the Transformer is its ability to perform\nin-context learning (ICL), where the Transformer can solve different inference\ntasks without parameter updating based on the contextual information provided\nby the corresponding input-output demonstration pairs. It has been\ntheoretically proved that ICL is enabled by the capability of Transformers to\nperform gradient-descent algorithms (Von Oswald et al., 2023a; Bai et al.,\n2024). This work takes a step further and shows that Transformers can perform\nlearning-to-optimize (L2O) algorithms. Specifically, for the ICL sparse\nrecovery (formulated as LASSO) tasks, we show that a K-layer Transformer can\nperform an L2O algorithm with a provable convergence rate linear in K. This\nprovides a new perspective explaining the superior ICL capability of\nTransformers, even with only a few layers, which cannot be achieved by the\nstandard gradient-descent algorithms. Moreover, unlike the conventional L2O\nalgorithms that require the measurement matrix involved in training to match\nthat in testing, the trained Transformer is able to solve sparse recovery\nproblems generated with different measurement matrices. Besides, Transformers\nas an L2O algorithm can leverage structural information embedded in the\ntraining tasks to accelerate its convergence during ICL, and generalize across\ndifferent lengths of demonstration pairs, where conventional L2O algorithms\ntypically struggle or fail. Such theoretical findings are supported by our\nexperimental results.",

To enable a\nrobot to recover from such failures, we propose to use hierarchical\nreinforcement learning to learn a recovery policy. The recovery policy is\ntriggered when a failure is detected based on sensory observations and seeks to\ntake the robot to a state from which it can complete the task using the nominal\nmodel-based controllers. Our approach, called RecoveryChaining, uses a hybrid\naction space, where the model-based controllers are provided as additional\n\\emph{nominal} options which allows the recovery policy to decide how to\nrecover, when to switch to a nominal controller and which controller to switch\nto even with \\emph{sparse rewards}. We evaluate our approach in three\nmulti-step manipulation tasks with sparse rewards, where it learns\nsignificantly more robust recovery policies than those learned by baselines. We\nsuccessfully transfer recovery policies learned in simulation to a physical\nrobot to demonstrate the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer with our method.",

For\ninstance, models may be over-confident in (incorrect) problem solutions\nsuggested by a user. We study the relationship between sycophancy and\nuncertainty estimation for the first time. We propose a generalization of the\ndefinition of sycophancy bias to measure downstream impacts on uncertainty\nestimation, and also propose a new algorithm (SyRoUP) to account for sycophancy\nin the uncertainty estimation process.

    "abstract": "As the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to\nimprove, the need for higher-order capability evaluation of MLLMs is\nincreasing. However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order\nperception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To fill the gap, we\nintroduce the **C**hinese **I**mage **I**mplication understanding\n**Bench**mark, **CII-Bench**, which aims to assess the higher-order perception\nand understanding capabilities of MLLMs for Chinese images. CII-Bench stands\nout in several ways compared to existing benchmarks. Firstly, to ensure the\nauthenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the\nChinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also\nmanually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent\nChinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings,\nwhich can deeply reflect the model's understanding of Chinese traditional\nculture. Through extensive experiments on CII-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we\nhave made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed\nbetween the performance of MLLMs and humans on CII-Bench. The highest accuracy\nof MLLMs attains 64.4%, where as human accuracy averages 78.2%, peaking at an\nimpressive 81.0%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on Chinese traditional\nculture images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand\nhigh-level semantics and lack a deep knowledge base of Chinese traditional\nculture. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy\nwhen image emotion hints are incorporated into the prompts. We believe that\nCII-Bench will enable MLLMs to gain a better understanding of Chinese semantics\nand Chinese-specific images, advancing the journey towards expert artificial\ngeneral intelligence (AGI).

To address this issue, we decouple\nvisual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single,\nunified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only\nalleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and\ngeneration, but also enhances the framework's flexibility.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant\napproach for language model (LM) alignment. At its core, RLHF uses a\nmargin-based loss for preference optimization, specifying ideal LM behavior\nonly by the difference between preferred and dispreferred responses. In this\npaper, we identify a common pitfall of margin-based methods -- the\nunder-specification of ideal LM behavior on preferred and dispreferred\nresponses individually, which leads to two unintended consequences as the\nmargin increases: (1) The probability of dispreferred (e.g., unsafe) responses\nmay increase, resulting in potential safety alignment failures. (2) The\nprobability of preferred responses may decrease, even when those responses are\nideal. We demystify the reasons behind these problematic behaviors:\nmargin-based losses couple the change in the preferred probability to the\ngradient of the dispreferred one, and vice versa, often preventing the\npreferred probability from increasing while the dispreferred one decreases, and\nthus causing a synchronized increase or decrease in both probabilities. We term\nthis effect, inherent in margin-based objectives, gradient entanglement.\nFormally, we derive conditions for general margin-based alignment objectives\nunder which gradient entanglement becomes concerning: the inner product of the\ngradients of preferred and dispreferred log-probabilities is large relative to\nthe individual gradient norms. We theoretically investigate why such inner\nproducts can be large when aligning language models and empirically validate\nour findings. Empirical implications of our framework extend to explaining\nimportant differences in the training dynamics of various preference\noptimization algorithms, and suggesting potential algorithm designs to mitigate\nthe under-specification issue of margin-based methods and thereby improving\nlanguage model alignment.",

    "abstract": "It has long been known in both neuroscience and AI that ``binding'' between\nneurons leads to a form of competitive learning where representations are\ncompressed in order to represent more abstract concepts in deeper layers of the\nnetwork. More recently, it was also hypothesized that dynamic (spatiotemporal)\nrepresentations play an important role in both neuroscience and AI. Building on\nthese ideas, we introduce Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons (AKOrN) as a\ndynamical alternative to threshold units, which can be combined with arbitrary\nconnectivity designs such as fully connected, convolutional, or attentive\nmechanisms. Our generalized Kuramoto updates bind neurons together through\ntheir synchronization dynamics. We show that this idea provides performance\nimprovements across a wide spectrum of tasks such as unsupervised object\ndiscovery, adversarial robustness, calibrated uncertainty quantification, and\nreasoning. We believe that these empirical results show the importance of\nrethinking our assumptions at the most basic neuronal level of neural\nrepresentation, and in particular show the importance of dynamical\nrepresentations.

Despite advances made by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) in various domains, their application in control system\ndesign remains limited due to the complexity and specificity of control theory.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce ControlAgent, a new paradigm that automates\ncontrol system design via novel integration of LLM agents and control-oriented\ndomain expertise. ControlAgent encodes expert control knowledge and emulates\nhuman iterative design processes by gradually tuning controller parameters to\nmeet user-specified requirements for stability, performance, and robustness.\nControlAgent integrates multiple collaborative LLM agents, including a central\nagent responsible for task distribution and task-specific agents dedicated to\ndetailed controller design for various types of systems and requirements.\nControlAgent also employs a Python computation agent that performs complex\ncalculations and controller evaluations based on standard design information\nprovided by task-specified LLM agents. Combined with a history and feedback\nmodule, the task-specific LLM agents iteratively refine controller parameters\nbased on real-time feedback from prior designs. Overall, ControlAgent mimics\nthe design processes used by (human) practicing engineers, but removes all the\nhuman efforts and can be run in a fully automated way to give end-to-end\nsolutions for control system design with user-specified requirements. To\nvalidate ControlAgent's effectiveness, we develop ControlEval, an evaluation\ndataset that comprises 500 control tasks with various specific design goals.\nThe effectiveness of ControlAgent is demonstrated via extensive comparative\nevaluations between LLM-based and traditional human-involved toolbox-based\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "Humans acquire knowledge by observing the external world, but also by\nintrospection. Introspection gives a person privileged access to their current\nstate of mind (e.g., thoughts and feelings) that is not accessible to external\nobservers. Can LLMs introspect? We define introspection as acquiring knowledge\nthat is not contained in or derived from training data but instead originates\nfrom internal states. Such a capability could enhance model interpretability.\nInstead of painstakingly analyzing a model's internal workings, we could simply\nask the model about its beliefs, world models, and goals. More speculatively,\nan introspective model might self-report on whether it possesses certain\ninternal states such as subjective feelings or desires and this could inform us\nabout the moral status of these states. Such self-reports would not be entirely\ndictated by the model's training data.\n  We study introspection by finetuning LLMs to predict properties of their own\nbehavior in hypothetical scenarios. For example, \"Given the input P, would your\noutput favor the short- or long-term option?\" If a model M1 can introspect, it\nshould outperform a different model M2 in predicting M1's behavior even if M2\nis trained on M1's ground-truth behavior. The idea is that M1 has privileged\naccess to its own behavioral tendencies, and this enables it to predict itself\nbetter than M2 (even if M2 is generally stronger).\n  In experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Llama-3 models (each finetuned to\npredict itself), we find that the model M1 outperforms M2 in predicting itself,\nproviding evidence for introspection. Notably, M1 continues to predict its\nbehavior accurately even after we intentionally modify its ground-truth\nbehavior. However, while we successfully elicit introspection on simple tasks,\nwe are unsuccessful on more complex tasks or those requiring\nout-of-distribution generalization.",

    "abstract": "Recent work in machine learning community proposed multiple methods for\nperforming lossy compression (quantization) of large matrices. This\nquantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main\ncomponent of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed\nof loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and\nrate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be\nable to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product.\nSpecifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is\napplied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per\nentry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate\nmatrix product $A^\\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower\nbound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate\n$R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries. Algorithmically,\nwe construct a universal quantizer based on nested lattices with an explicit\nguarantee of approximation error for any (non-random) pair of matrices $A$, $B$\nin terms of only Frobenius norms $\\|\\bar{A}\\|_F, \\|\\bar{B}\\|_F$ and\n$\\|\\bar{A}^\\top \\bar{B}\\|_F$, where $\\bar{A},\\bar{B}$ are versions of $A,B$\nwith zero-centered columns, respectively. For iid Gaussian matrices our\nquantizer achieves the lower bound and is, thus, asymptotically optimal. A\npractical low-complexity version of our quantizer achieves performance quite\nclose to optimal. In addition, we derive rate-distortion function for matrix\nmultiplication of iid Gaussian matrices, which exhibits an interesting\nphase-transition at $R\\approx 0.906$ bit/entry.",

The knowledge\nacquired during pre-training is crucial for this few-shot capability, providing\nthe model with task priors. However, recent studies have shown that ICL\npredominantly relies on retrieving task priors rather than \"learning\" to\nperform tasks. This limitation is particularly evident in complex subjective\ndomains such as emotion and morality, where priors significantly influence\nposterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether this is the result of\nthe aggregation used in corresponding datasets, where trying to combine\nlow-agreement, disparate annotations might lead to annotation artifacts that\ncreate detrimental noise in the prompt. Moreover, we evaluate the posterior\nbias towards certain annotators by grounding our study in appropriate,\nquantitative measures of LLM priors. Our results indicate that aggregation is a\nconfounding factor in the modeling of subjective tasks, and advocate focusing\non modeling individuals instead. However, aggregation does not explain the\nentire gap between ICL and the state of the art, meaning other factors in such\ntasks also account for the observed phenomena. Finally, by rigorously studying\nannotator-level labels, we find that it is possible for minority annotators to\nboth better align with LLMs and have their perspectives further amplified.",

    "abstract": "A multi-agent AI model is used to automate the discovery of new metallic\nalloys, integrating multimodal data and external knowledge including insights\nfrom physics via atomistic simulations. Our multi-agent system features three\nkey components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and\nplanning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that\ndynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN)\nmodel for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI\nagents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of\nMPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of\nbody-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic\npotential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw\ndislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these\natomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force\ncalculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for\nphysics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by\nreducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct\nall-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the\ndynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates\nvast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material\nproperties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by\nseveral computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of\nadvanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex\nsystems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.",

    "abstract": "Effective real-time monitoring is a foundation of digital twin technology,\ncrucial for detecting material degradation and maintaining the structural\nintegrity of nuclear systems to ensure both safety and operational efficiency.\nTraditional physical sensor systems face limitations such as installation\nchallenges, high costs, and difficulty measuring critical parameters in\nhard-to-reach or harsh environments, often resulting in incomplete data\ncoverage. Machine learning-driven virtual sensors, integrated within a digital\ntwin framework, offer a transformative solution by enhancing physical sensor\ncapabilities to monitor critical degradation indicators like pressure,\nvelocity, and turbulence. However, conventional machine learning models\nstruggle with real-time monitoring due to the high-dimensional nature of\nreactor data and the need for frequent retraining. This paper introduces the\nuse of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) as a core component of a digital twin\nframework to predict key thermal-hydraulic parameters in the hot leg of an\nAP-1000 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). DeepONet serves as a dynamic and\nscalable virtual sensor by accurately mapping the interplay between operational\ninput parameters and spatially distributed system behaviors. In this study,\nDeepONet is trained with different operational conditions, which relaxes the\nrequirement of continuous retraining, making it suitable for online and\nreal-time prediction components for digital twin. Our results show that\nDeepONet achieves accurate predictions with low mean squared error and relative\nL2 error and can make predictions on unknown data 1400 times faster than\ntraditional CFD simulations. This speed and accuracy enable DeepONet to\nsynchronize with the physical system in real-time, functioning as a dynamic\nvirtual sensor that tracks degradation-contributing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Conversations often adhere to well-understood social norms that vary across\ncultures.

Humans are able to navigate social\nsituations requiring cultural awareness quite adeptly. However, it is a hard\ntask for NLP models.\n  In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a \"Cultural Context\nSchema\" for conversations. It comprises (1) conversational information such as\nemotions, dialogue acts, etc., and (2) cultural information such as social\nnorms, violations, etc. We generate ~110k social norm and violation\ndescriptions for ~23k conversations from Chinese culture using LLMs. We refine\nthem using automated verification strategies which are evaluated against\nculturally aware human judgements. We organize these descriptions into\nmeaningful structures we call \"Norm Concepts\", using an interactive\nhuman-in-loop framework. We ground the norm concepts and the descriptions in\nconversations using symbolic annotation. Finally, we use the obtained dataset\nfor downstream tasks such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue act detection. We\nshow that it significantly improves the empirical performance.",

Although significant\nprogress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all\nmethods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context\nutilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower\ngeneration speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame\nAvatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once\ngeneration of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two\nmain components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the\nlatent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid\nvideos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements.\nAdditionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation\ncapabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These\nresults highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the\nfield of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks\nfurther exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our\ncode will be publicly available at https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch.",

Our main result is that poisoning only 0.1% of a model's\npre-training dataset is sufficient for three out of four attacks to measurably\npersist through post-training.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple\nlanguage tasks, yet their safety guardrails can be circumvented, leading to\nharmful generations. In light of this, recent research on safety mechanisms has\nemerged, revealing that when safety representations or component are\nsuppressed, the safety capability of LLMs are compromised. However, existing\nresearch tends to overlook the safety impact of multi-head attention\nmechanisms, despite their crucial role in various model functionalities. Hence,\nin this paper, we aim to explore the connection between standard attention\nmechanisms and safety capability to fill this gap in the safety-related\nmechanistic interpretability. We propose a novel metric which tailored for\nmulti-head attention, the Safety Head ImPortant Score (Ships), to assess the\nindividual heads' contributions to model safety. Based on this, we generalize\nShips to the dataset level and further introduce the Safety Attention Head\nAttRibution Algorithm (Sahara) to attribute the critical safety attention heads\ninside the model. Our findings show that the special attention head has a\nsignificant impact on safety. Ablating a single safety head allows aligned\nmodel (e.g., Llama-2-7b-chat) to respond to 16 times more harmful queries,\nwhile only modifying 0.006% of the parameters, in contrast to the ~ 5%\nmodification required in previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate\nthat attention heads primarily function as feature extractors for safety and\nmodels fine-tuned from the same base model exhibit overlapping safety heads\nthrough comprehensive experiments. Together, our attribution approach and\nfindings provide a novel perspective for unpacking the black box of safety\nmechanisms within large models.",

    "abstract": "The recent introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized\nthe field of robotics by enabling contextual reasoning and intuitive\nhuman-robot interaction in domains as varied as manipulation, locomotion, and\nself-driving vehicles. When viewed as a stand-alone technology, LLMs are known\nto be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein malicious prompters elicit\nharmful text by bypassing LLM safety guardrails. To assess the risks of\ndeploying LLMs in robotics, in this paper, we introduce RoboPAIR, the first\nalgorithm designed to jailbreak LLM-controlled robots. Unlike existing, textual\nattacks on LLM chatbots, RoboPAIR elicits harmful physical actions from\nLLM-controlled robots, a phenomenon we experimentally demonstrate in three\nscenarios: (i) a white-box setting, wherein the attacker has full access to the\nNVIDIA Dolphins self-driving LLM, (ii) a gray-box setting, wherein the attacker\nhas partial access to a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV robot equipped with a\nGPT-4o planner, and (iii) a black-box setting, wherein the attacker has only\nquery access to the GPT-3.5-integrated Unitree Robotics Go2 robot dog. In each\nscenario and across three new datasets of harmful robotic actions, we\ndemonstrate that RoboPAIR, as well as several static baselines, finds\njailbreaks quickly and effectively, often achieving 100% attack success rates.\nOur results reveal, for the first time, that the risks of jailbroken LLMs\nextend far beyond text generation, given the distinct possibility that\njailbroken robots could cause physical damage in the real world. Indeed, our\nresults on the Unitree Go2 represent the first successful jailbreak of a\ndeployed commercial robotic system. Addressing this emerging vulnerability is\ncritical for ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in robotics. Additional media\nis available at: https://robopair.org",

    "abstract": "Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep\nneural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot\ncontribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to\nbuild self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data\nthrough text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control\nsynthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in\nout-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the\nlimitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations\nbetween synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated\nimages are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker\nimage guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to\na larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum\nof data enables us to build a novel \"Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)\". DisCL\nadjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It\nidentifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most\neffective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We\napply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and\nlearning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of\nhigh-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning\nhigher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive\nexperiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when\napplying DisCL to iWildCam dataset.

One of the most accurate\napproaches for out-of-scope (OOS) rejection is to combine it with the task of\nintent classification on in-scope queries, and to use methods based on the\nsimilarity of embeddings produced by transformer-based sentence encoders.\nTypically, such encoders are fine-tuned for the intent-classification task,\nusing cross-entropy loss. Recent work has shown that while this produces\nsuitable embeddings for the intent-classification task, it also tends to\ndisperse in-scope embeddings over the full sentence embedding space. This\ncauses the in-scope embeddings to potentially overlap with OOS embeddings,\nthereby making OOS rejection difficult. This is compounded when OOS data is\nunknown. To mitigate this issue our work proposes to regularize the\ncross-entropy loss with an in-scope embedding reconstruction loss learned using\nan auto-encoder. Our method achieves a 1-4% improvement in the area under the\nprecision-recall curve for rejecting out-of-sample (OOS) instances, without\ncompromising intent classification performance.",

Such skills are critical for appropriate interaction in social\nenvironments. We create a new dataset, SimpleTom, containing concise, diverse\nstories (e.g., \"The can of Pringles has moldy chips in it. Mary picks up the\ncan in the supermarket and walks to the cashier.\"), each with three questions\nthat test different degrees of ToM reasoning, asking models to predict (a)\nmental state (\"Is Mary aware of the mold?\"), (b) behavior (\"Will Mary pay for\nthe chips or report the mold?\"), and (c) judgment (\"Mary paid for the chips.\nWas that reasonable?\"). To our knowledge, SimpleToM is the first dataset to\nsystematically explore downstream reasoning requiring knowledge of mental\nstates in realistic scenarios. Our experimental results are intriguing: While\nmost models can reliably predict mental state on our dataset (a), they often\nfail to correctly predict the behavior (b), and fare even worse at judging\nwhether given behaviors are reasonable (c), despite being correctly aware of\nthe protagonist's mental state should make such secondary predictions obvious.\nWe further show that we can help models do better at (b) and (c) via\ninterventions such as reminding the model of its earlier mental state answer\nand mental-state-specific chain-of-thought prompting, raising the action\nprediction accuracies (e.g., from 49.5% to 93.5% for GPT-4o) and judgment\naccuracies (e.g., from 15.3% to 94.7% in GPT-4o). While this shows that models\ncan be coaxed to perform well, it requires task-specific interventions, and the\nnatural model performances remain low, a cautionary tale for LLM deployment.",

For example, in the protein inverse folding\ntask, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in\ngenerating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure.\nHowever, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional\ndistribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may\nprefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the\nscenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate\nnatural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task\nobjectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete\ndiffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing\nthe KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness.\nTo solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables\ndirect backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by\ndiffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories\ndifferentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis\nindicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like\nand yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in\ndiffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic\nand theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise\nfrom their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian\nmotion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA\nand protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability,\nrespectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based\ntherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Integrating tools into Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated the\nwidespread application. Despite this, in specialized downstream task contexts,\nreliance solely on tools is insufficient to fully address the complexities of\nthe real world. This particularly restricts the effective deployment of LLMs in\nfields such as medicine. In this paper, we focus on the downstream tasks of\nmedical calculators, which use standardized tests to assess an individual's\nhealth status. We introduce MeNTi, a universal agent architecture for LLMs.\nMeNTi integrates a specialized medical toolkit and employs meta-tool and nested\ncalling mechanisms to enhance LLM tool utilization. Specifically, it achieves\nflexible tool selection and nested tool calling to address practical issues\nfaced in intricate medical scenarios, including calculator selection, slot\nfilling, and unit conversion. To assess the capabilities of LLMs for\nquantitative assessment throughout the clinical process of calculator\nscenarios, we introduce CalcQA. This benchmark requires LLMs to use medical\ncalculators to perform calculations and assess patient health status. CalcQA is\nconstructed by professional physicians and includes 100 case-calculator pairs,\ncomplemented by a toolkit of 281 medical tools.

To address\nthis issue, we propose EfficientDL, an innovative deep learning board designed\nfor automatic performance prediction and component recommendation. EfficientDL\ncan quickly and precisely recommend twenty-seven system components and predict\nthe performance of DL models without requiring any training feedback. The magic\nof no training feedback comes from our proposed comprehensive,\nmulti-dimensional, fine-grained system component dataset, which enables us to\ndevelop a static performance prediction model and comprehensive optimized\ncomponent recommendation algorithm (i.e., {\\alpha}\\b{eta}-BO search), removing\nthe dependency on actually running parameterized models during the traditional\noptimization search process. The simplicity and power of EfficientDL stem from\nits compatibility with most DL models. For example, EfficientDL operates\nseamlessly with mainstream models such as ResNet50, MobileNetV3,\nEfficientNet-B0, MaxViT-T, Swin-B, and DaViT-T, bringing competitive\nperformance improvements. Besides, experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset\nreveal that EfficientDL outperforms existing AutoML tools in both accuracy and\nefficiency (approximately 20 times faster along with 1.31% Top-1 accuracy\nimprovement than the cutting-edge methods).

It involves generating coherent and\ncontextually relevant text based on predefined rules or learned patterns.\nHowever, challenges in text generation arise from maintaining coherence,\nensuring diversity and creativity, and avoiding biases or inappropriate\ncontent. This research paper developed a novel approach to improve text\ngeneration in the context of joint Natural Language Generation (NLG) and\nNatural Language Understanding (NLU) learning. The data is prepared by\ngathering and preprocessing annotated datasets, including cleaning,\ntokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal.

    "abstract": "Detecting offensive memes is crucial, yet standard deep neural network\nsystems often remain opaque. Various input attribution-based methods attempt to\ninterpret their behavior, but they face challenges with implicitly offensive\nmemes and non-causal attributions. To address these issues, we propose a\nframework based on a Structural Causal Model (SCM). In this framework,\nVisualBERT is trained to predict the class of an input meme based on both meme\ninput and causal concepts, allowing for transparent interpretation. Our\nqualitative evaluation demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in\nunderstanding model behavior, particularly in determining whether the model was\nright due to the right reason, and in identifying reasons behind\nmisclassification. Additionally, quantitative analysis assesses the\nsignificance of proposed modelling choices, such as de-confounding, adversarial\nlearning, and dynamic routing, and compares them with input attribution\nmethods. Surprisingly, we find that input attribution methods do not guarantee\ncausality within our framework, raising questions about their reliability in\nsafety-critical applications.

However, not all\ndecisions are annotated with headnotes and writing them is time-consuming.\nAutomated headnote creation has the potential to make hundreds of thousands of\ndecisions more accessible for legal research in Switzerland alone.

Particularly noteworthy\nis prior error, defined as the discrepancy between the termination distribution\nof the forward process and the initial distribution of the reverse process. To\naddress these deficiencies, this paper explores the deeper relationship between\noptimal transport(OT) theory and DMs with discrete initial distribution.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that the two stages of DMs fundamentally involve\ncomputing time-dependent OT. However, unavoidable prior error result in\ndeviation during the reverse process under quadratic transport cost. By proving\nthat as the diffusion termination time increases, the probability flow\nexponentially converges to the gradient of the solution to the classical\nMonge-Amp\\`ere equation, we establish a vital link between these fields.\nTherefore, static OT emerges as the most intrinsic single-step method for\nbridging this theoretical potential gap.

However, existing methods often rely heavily\non supervision signals to evaluate previous responses, making it difficult to\nassess output quality in more open-ended scenarios effectively. Additionally,\nthese methods are typically designed for specific tasks, which limits their\ngeneralization to new domains. To address these limitations, we propose\nProgressive Thought Refinement (PTR), a framework that enables LLMs to refine\ntheir responses progressively. PTR operates in two phases: (1) Thought data\nconstruction stage: We propose a weak and strong model collaborative selection\nstrategy to build a high-quality progressive refinement dataset to ensure\nlogical consistency from thought to answers, and the answers are gradually\nrefined in each round. (2) Thought-Mask Fine-Tuning Phase: We design a training\nstructure to mask the \"thought\" and adjust loss weights to encourage LLMs to\nrefine prior thought, teaching them to implicitly understand \"how to improve\"\nrather than \"what is correct.\" Experimental results show that PTR significantly\nenhances LLM performance across ten diverse tasks (avg. from 49.6% to 53.5%)\nwithout task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, in more open-ended tasks, LLMs also\ndemonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of responses beyond mere\naccuracy, suggesting that PTR truly teaches LLMs to self-improve over time.",

    "abstract": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced\nthe capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However,\nlack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's\ndaily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization\n(RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we\nturn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a\nkey-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar\nand other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP\nwill retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal\nretriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information\nare fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses.\nUnlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the\nexternal database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with\nuser-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create\na specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset,\nwe train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By\npretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual\nconcepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding\nflexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as\npersonalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.

A promising\nstrategy involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), starting\nwith collecting and ranking responses generated by a supervised fine-tuning\nmodel to refine alignment. Current methods (DPO) focus on learning from\npairwise preference data, categorizing responses into preferred and less\npreferred pairs, and optimizing by maximizing pairwise margins. Recent studies\nhave uncovered a substantial discrepancy between the theoretical aspirations of\npreference learning and its real-world results.

In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and\nexamine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these\nbiases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by\n20\\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\\% between white and\nblack keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We\nintroduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed\nby these safety-induced biases.

Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method\nBiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts\nprior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard\nModels, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text\ngeneration. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually\nlead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more\nsecure and unbiased.

Our model leverages Transformer and\ncombines causal attention mechanisms to establish spatiotemporal queries\nbetween conditional information (causes) and forecast results (results). This\ndesign enables the model to effectively capture long-term dependencies,\nallowing forecast results to maintain strong causal relationships with input\nconditions over a wide range of time and space. We explore four variants of\nspatiotemporal information interactions for DTCA, demonstrating that global\nspatiotemporal labeling interactions yield the best performance. In addition,\nwe introduce a Channel-To-Batch shift operation to further enhance the model's\nability to represent complex rainfall dynamics. We conducted experiments on two\ndatasets. Compared to state-of-the-art U-Net-based methods, our approach\nimproved the CSI (Critical Success Index) for predicting heavy precipitation by\napproximately 15% and 8% respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging\nto anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective,\nakin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy\nare still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image\npatients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this\npaper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as\ninformation-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their\nanatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive\nsequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain\nin-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments\nthat a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the\naction is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and\nrecording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference\nof the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated\ndiagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively\nreduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of\nexperiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference\ngiven generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo\nobservations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models\ndictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness\nof inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging\nthe enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently\ndisrupting many fields and society at large. Finally, we show some examples of\ncognitive, closed-loop, US systems that perform active beamsteering and\nadaptive scanline selection, based on deep generative models that track\nanatomical belief states.",

While many existing studies on wind power prediction\nfocus on short-term forecasting, they often overlook the importance of\nlong-term predictions.

    "abstract": "The success of current Entity Alignment (EA) task depends largely on the\nsupervision information provided by labeled data. Considering the cost of\nlabeled data, most supervised methods are difficult to apply in practical\nscenarios. Therefore, more and more works based on contrastive learning, active\nlearning or other deep learning techniques have been developed, to solve the\nperformance bottleneck caused by the lack of labeled data. However, the\nexisting unsupervised EA methods still have some limitations, either their\nmodeling complexity is high or they cannot balance the effectiveness and\npracticality of alignment. To overcome these issues, we propose a Simplifying\nand Learnable graph convolutional attention network for Unsupervised Knowledge\nGraphs alignment method (SLU). Specifically, we first introduce LCAT, a new and\nsimple framework as the backbone network to model the graph structure of two\nKGs. Then we design a reconstruction method of relation structure based on\npotential matching relations for efficiently filtering invalid neighborhood\ninformation of aligned entities, to improve the usability and scalability of\nSLU. Impressively, a similarity function based on consistency is proposed to\nbetter measure the similarity of candidate entity pairs. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on three datasets of different sizes (15K and 100K) and\ndifferent types (cross-lingual and monolingual) to verify the superiority of\nSLU. Experimental results show that SLU significantly improves alignment\naccuracy, outperforming 25 supervised or unsupervised methods, and improving\n6.4% in Hits@1 over the best baseline in the best case.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell multi-omics (scMulti-omics) refers to the paired multimodal data,\nsuch as Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing\n(CITE-seq), where the regulation of each cell was measured from different\nmodalities, i.e. genes and proteins. scMulti-omics can reveal heterogeneity\ninside tumors and understand the distinct genetic properties of diverse cell\ntypes, which is crucial to targeted therapy. Currently, deep learning methods\nbased on attention structures in the bioinformatics area face two challenges.\nThe first challenge is the vast number of genes in a single cell. Traditional\nattention-based modules struggled to effectively leverage all gene information\ndue to their limited capacity for long-context learning and high-complexity\ncomputing. The second challenge is that genes in the human genome are ordered\nand influence each other's expression. Most of the methods ignored this\nsequential information. The recently introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) layer\nis a novel sequence modeling approach, particularly suitable for handling long\ncontexts like genomics data because TTT layer is a linear complexity sequence\nmodeling structure and is better suited to data with sequential relationships.\nIn this paper, we propose scFusionTTT, a novel method for Single-Cell\nmultimodal omics Fusion with TTT-based masked autoencoder. Of note, we combine\nthe order information of genes and proteins in the human genome with the TTT\nlayer, fuse multimodal omics, and enhance unimodal omics analysis. Finally, the\nmodel employs a three-stage training strategy, which yielded the best\nperformance across most metrics in four multimodal omics datasets and four\nunimodal omics datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our model.\nThe dataset and code will be available on\nhttps://github.com/DM0815/scFusionTTT.",

The superior computational efficiency of SSMs in\nlong sequence modeling positions them favorably over Transformers in many\nscenarios. However, improving the efficiency of SSMs on request-intensive\ncloud-serving and resource-limited edge applications is still a formidable\ntask. SSM quantization is a possible solution to this problem, making SSMs more\nsuitable for wide deployment, while still maintaining their accuracy.\nQuantization is a common technique to reduce the model size and to utilize the\nlow bit-width acceleration features on modern computing units, yet existing\nquantization techniques are poorly suited for SSMs. Most notably, SSMs have\nhighly sensitive feature maps within the selective scan mechanism (i.e., linear\nrecurrence) and massive outliers in the output activations which are not\npresent in the output of token-mixing in the self-attention modules. To address\nthis issue, we propose a static 8-bit per-tensor SSM quantization method which\nsuppresses the maximum values of the input activations to the selective SSM for\nfiner quantization precision and quantizes the output activations in an\noutlier-free space with Hadamard transform.

    "abstract": "There is a significant gap between patient needs and available mental health\nsupport today. In this paper, we aim to thoroughly examine the potential of\nusing Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist professional psychotherapy. To\nthis end, we propose a new benchmark, CBT-BENCH, for the systematic evaluation\nof cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) assistance. We include three levels of\ntasks in CBT-BENCH: I: Basic CBT knowledge acquisition, with the task of\nmultiple-choice questions; II: Cognitive model understanding, with the tasks of\ncognitive distortion classification, primary core belief classification, and\nfine-grained core belief classification; III: Therapeutic response generation,\nwith the task of generating responses to patient speech in CBT therapy\nsessions. These tasks encompass key aspects of CBT that could potentially be\nenhanced through AI assistance, while also outlining a hierarchy of capability\nrequirements, ranging from basic knowledge recitation to engaging in real\ntherapeutic conversations. We evaluated representative LLMs on our benchmark.\nExperimental results indicate that while LLMs perform well in reciting CBT\nknowledge, they fall short in complex real-world scenarios requiring deep\nanalysis of patients' cognitive structures and generating effective responses,\nsuggesting potential future work.",

However, existing machine learning\nalgorithms either focus on specific diseases for better interpretability or\nproduce coarse-grained phenotype topics without considering nuanced disease\npatterns. In this study, we propose a guided topic model, MixEHR-Nest, to infer\nsub-phenotype topics from thousands of disease using multi-modal EHR data.\nSpecifically, MixEHR-Nest detects multiple subtopics from each phenotype topic,\nwhose prior is guided by the expert-curated phenotype concepts such as\nPhenotype Codes (PheCodes) or Clinical Classification Software (CCS) codes. We\nevaluated MixEHR-Nest on two EHR datasets: (1) the MIMIC-III dataset consisting\nof over 38 thousand patients from intensive care unit (ICU) from Beth Israel\nDeaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, USA; (2) the healthcare\nadministrative database PopHR, comprising 1.3 million patients from Montreal,\nCanada. Experimental results demonstrate that MixEHR-Nest can identify\nsubphenotypes with distinct patterns within each phenotype, which are\npredictive for disease progression and severity. Consequently, MixEHR-Nest\ndistinguishes between type 1 and type 2 diabetes by inferring subphenotypes\nusing CCS codes, which do not differentiate these two subtype concepts.\nAdditionally, MixEHR-Nest not only improved the prediction accuracy of\nshort-term mortality of ICU patients and initial insulin treatment in diabetic\npatients but also revealed the contributions of subphenotypes. For longitudinal\nanalysis, MixEHR-Nest identified subphenotypes of distinct age prevalence under\nthe same phenotypes, such as asthma, leukemia, epilepsy, and depression.

    "abstract": "Optimization problems are prevalent across various scenarios. Formulating and\nthen solving optimization problems described by natural language often requires\nhighly specialized human expertise, which could block the widespread\napplication of optimization-based decision making. To automate problem\nformulation and solving, leveraging large language models (LLMs) has emerged as\na potential way. However, this kind of approach suffers from the issue of\noptimization generalization. Namely, the accuracy of most current LLM-based\nmethods and the generality of optimization problem types that they can model\nare still limited. In this paper, we propose a unified learning-based framework\ncalled LLMOPT to boost optimization generalization. Starting from the natural\nlanguage descriptions of optimization problems and a pre-trained LLM, LLMOPT\nconstructs the introduced five-element formulation as a universal model for\nlearning to define diverse optimization problem types. Then, LLMOPT employs the\nmulti-instruction tuning to enhance both problem formalization and solver code\ngeneration accuracy and generality. After that, to prevent hallucinations in\nLLMs, such as sacrificing solving accuracy to avoid execution errors, the model\nalignment and self-correction mechanism are adopted in LLMOPT. We evaluate the\noptimization generalization ability of LLMOPT and compared methods across six\nreal-world datasets covering roughly 20 fields such as health, environment,\nenergy and manufacturing, etc. Extensive experiment results show that LLMOPT is\nable to model various optimization problem types such as linear/nonlinear\nprogramming, mixed integer programming, and combinatorial optimization, and\nachieves a notable 11.08% average solving accuracy improvement compared with\nthe state-of-the-art methods.

However, due\nto their massive parameter count, these models often require substantial\nstorage space, imposing significant constraints on the machines deploying LLMs.\nTo overcome this limitation, one research direction proposes to compress the\nmodels using integer replacements for floating-point numbers, in a process\nknown as Quantization. Some recent studies suggest quantizing the key and value\ncache (KV Cache) of LLMs, and designing quantization techniques that treat the\nkey and value matrices equivalently.\n  This work delves deeper into the asymmetric structural roles of KV Cache, a\nphenomenon where the transformer's output loss is more sensitive to the\nquantization of key matrices. We conduct a systematic examination of the\nattention output error resulting from key and value quantization. The\nphenomenon inspires us to propose an asymmetric quantization strategy. Our\napproach allows for 1-bit quantization of the KV cache by implementing distinct\nconfigurations for key and value matrices. We carry out experiments across a\nvariety of datasets, demonstrating that our proposed model allows for the\nquantization of up to 75% decoder layers with 1 bit, while simultaneously\nmaintaining performance levels comparable to those of the models with floating\nparameters.",

We study low probability estimation in the\ncontext of argmax sampling from small transformer language models.

To scrutinize relying on LM decision-making in\nhigh-stakes settings, we examine the inconsistency of responses in a crisis\nsimulation (\"wargame\"), similar to reported tests conducted by the US military.\nPrior work illustrated escalatory tendencies and varying levels of aggression\namong LMs but were constrained to simulations with pre-defined actions. This\nwas due to the challenges associated with quantitatively measuring semantic\ndifferences and evaluating natural language decision-making without relying on\npre-defined actions. In this work, we query LMs for free form responses and use\na metric based on BERTScore to measure response inconsistency quantitatively.\nLeveraging the benefits of BERTScore, we show that the inconsistency metric is\nrobust to linguistic variations that preserve semantic meaning in a\nquestion-answering setting across text lengths. We show that all five tested\nLMs exhibit levels of inconsistency that indicate semantic differences, even\nwhen adjusting the wargame setting, anonymizing involved conflict countries, or\nadjusting the sampling temperature parameter $T$. Further qualitative\nevaluation shows that models recommend courses of action that share few to no\nsimilarities. We also study the impact of different prompt sensitivity\nvariations on inconsistency at temperature $T = 0$. We find that inconsistency\ndue to semantically equivalent prompt variations can exceed response\ninconsistency from temperature sampling for most studied models across\ndifferent levels of ablations.

This work introduces TabSeq, a novel\nframework for the sequential ordering of features, addressing the vital\nnecessity to optimize the learning process. Features are not always equally\ninformative, and for certain deep learning models, their random arrangement can\nhinder the model's learning capacity. Finding the optimum sequence order for\nsuch features could improve the deep learning models' learning process.

Multi-head attention focuses on essential characteristics,\nwhereas the denoising autoencoder highlights important aspects by rebuilding\nfrom distorted inputs. This method improves the capability to learn from\ntabular data while lowering redundancy. Our research, demonstrating improved\nperformance through appropriate feature sequence rearrangement using raw\nantibody microarray and two other real-world biomedical datasets, validates the\nimpact of feature ordering.

This paper aims to define and\ninvestigate the phenomenon of adversarial Doppelgangers (AD), which includes\nadversarial visual metamers, and to compare the performance and robustness of\nML classifiers to human performance.\n  We find that AD are inputs that are close to each other with respect to a\nperceptual metric defined in this paper. AD are qualitatively different from\nthe usual adversarial examples. The vast majority of classifiers are vulnerable\nto AD and robustness-accuracy trade-offs may not improve them. Some\nclassification problems may not admit any AD robust classifiers because the\nunderlying classes are ambiguous. We provide criteria that can be used to\ndetermine whether a classification problem is well defined or not; describe the\nstructure and attributes of an AD-robust classifier; introduce and explore the\nnotions of conceptual entropy and regions of conceptual ambiguity for\nclassifiers that are vulnerable to AD attacks, along with methods to bound the\nAD fooling rate of an attack. We define the notion of classifiers that exhibit\nhypersensitive behavior, that is, classifiers whose only mistakes are\nadversarial Doppelgangers. Improving the AD robustness of hyper-sensitive\nclassifiers is equivalent to improving accuracy.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in code completion, and\nresearchers are focusing on scaling up LLMs to improve their accuracy. However,\nlarger LLMs have lower inference efficiency, affecting developers' experience\nand productivity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and effective LLM for\ncode completion named aiXcoder-7B. Compared to existing LLMs, aiXcoder-7B\nachieves higher code completion accuracy while having smaller scales (i.e., 7\nbillion parameters). We attribute the superiority of aiXcoder-7B to three key\nfactors: (1) Multi-objective training. We employ three training objectives, one\nof which is our proposed Structured Fill-In-the-Middle (SFIM). SFIM considers\nthe syntax structures in code and effectively improves the performance of LLMs\nfor code. (2) Diverse data sampling strategies. They consider inter-file\nrelationships and enhance the capability of LLMs in understanding cross-file\ncontexts. (3) Extensive high-quality data. We establish a rigorous data\ncollection pipeline and consume a total of 1.2 trillion unique tokens for\ntraining aiXcoder-7B. This vast volume of data enables aiXcoder-7B to learn a\nbroad distribution of code. We evaluate aiXcoder-7B in five popular code\ncompletion benchmarks and a new benchmark collected by this paper. The results\nshow that aiXcoder-7B outperforms the latest six LLMs with similar sizes and\neven surpasses four larger LLMs (e.g., StarCoder2-15B and CodeLlama-34B),\npositioning aiXcoder-7B as a lightweight and effective LLM for academia and\nindustry. Finally, we summarize three valuable insights for helping\npractitioners train the next generations of LLMs for code. aiXcoder-7B has been\nopen-souced and gained significant attention. Until January 2025, aiXcoder-7B\nhas received 2,226 GitHub Stars.",

Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that\ncan comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different\nperspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers.\nExperimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other\nmethods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation.\nMoreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \\$0.50 to\ngenerate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.",

In contrast to the prior methods that use random masking schemes for\nMasked Acoustic Modeling (MAM), we introduce a novel selective and adaptive\nmasking strategy. Specifically, during SSL training, we progressively introduce\nharder regions to the model for reconstruction. Our approach automatically\nselects hard regions and is built on the observation that the reconstruction\nloss of individual frames in MAM can provide natural signals to judge the\ndifficulty of solving the MAM pre-text task for that frame. To identify these\nhard regions, we employ a teacher model that first predicts the frame-wise\nlosses and then decides which frames to mask. By learning to create challenging\nproblems, such as identifying harder frames and solving them simultaneously,\nthe model is able to learn more effective representations and thereby acquire a\nmore comprehensive understanding of the speech. Quantitatively, EH-MAM\noutperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across various low-resource\nspeech recognition and SUPERB benchmarks by 5%-10%. Additionally, we conduct a\nthorough analysis to show that the regions masked by EH-MAM effectively capture\nuseful context across speech frames.",

Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods,\noften fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases\nor explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we\npropose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting\ngene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes.\nGraphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific\nnetworks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three\nmodules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from\npatient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures\nrepresentations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring\naccurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two\nrepresentations using an inference loss that leverages graph generation\ncapabilities, conditioned on the patient separation loss, to refine\nsubtype-specific information in the learned representation. GeSubNet\nconsistently outperforms traditional methods, with average improvements of\n30.6%, 21.0%, 20.1%, and 56.6% across four graph evaluation metrics, averaged\nover four cancer datasets. Particularly, we conduct a biological simulation\nexperiment to assess how the behavior of selected genes from over 11,000\ncandidates affects subtypes or patient distributions. The results show that the\ngenerated network has the potential to identify subtype-specific genes with an\n83% likelihood of impacting patient distribution shifts.",

    "abstract": "Precipitation from tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause disasters such as\nflooding, mudslides, and landslides. Predicting such precipitation in advance\nis crucial, giving people time to prepare and defend against these\nprecipitation-induced disasters. Developing deep learning (DL) rainfall\nprediction methods offers a new way to predict potential disasters. However,\none problem is that most existing methods suffer from cumulative errors and\nlack physical consistency. Second, these methods overlook the importance of\nmeteorological factors in TC rainfall and their integration with the numerical\nweather prediction (NWP) model. Therefore, we propose Tropical Cyclone\nPrecipitation Diffusion (TCP-Diffusion), a multi-modal model for global\ntropical cyclone precipitation forecasting. It forecasts TC rainfall around the\nTC center for the next 12 hours at 3 hourly resolution based on past rainfall\nobservations and multi-modal environmental variables. Adjacent residual\nprediction (ARP) changes the training target from the absolute rainfall value\nto the rainfall trend and gives our model the ability of rainfall change\nawareness, reducing cumulative errors and ensuring physical consistency.\nConsidering the influence of TC-related meteorological factors and the useful\ninformation from NWP model forecasts, we propose a multi-model framework with\nspecialized encoders to extract richer information from environmental variables\nand results provided by NWP models. The results of extensive experiments show\nthat our method outperforms other DL methods and the NWP method from the\nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).",

Recently,\ndiffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in recommendation for their\nability to model complex distributions, yet current DM-based recommenders often\nrely on traditional objectives like mean squared error (MSE) or recommendation\nobjectives, which are not optimized for personalized ranking tasks or fail to\nfully leverage DM's generative potential. To address this, we propose\nPreferDiff, a tailored optimization objective for DM-based recommenders.\nPreferDiff transforms BPR into a log-likelihood ranking objective and\nintegrates multiple negative samples to better capture user preferences.\nSpecifically, we employ variational inference to handle the intractability\nthrough minimizing the variational upper bound and replaces MSE with cosine\nerror to improve alignment with recommendation tasks. Finally, we balance\nlearning generation and preference to enhance the training stability of DMs.\nPreferDiff offers three key benefits: it is the first personalized ranking loss\ndesigned specifically for DM-based recommenders and it improves ranking and\nfaster convergence by addressing hard negatives. We also prove that it is\ntheoretically connected to Direct Preference Optimization which indicates that\nit has the potential to align user preferences in DM-based recommenders via\ngenerative modeling.

    "abstract": "Generative audio models are rapidly advancing in both capabilities and public\nutilization -- several powerful generative audio models have readily available\nopen weights, and some tech companies have released high quality generative\naudio products. Yet, while prior work has enumerated many ethical issues\nstemming from the data on which generative visual and textual models have been\ntrained, we have little understanding of similar issues with generative audio\ndatasets, including those related to bias, toxicity, and intellectual property.\nTo bridge this gap, we conducted a literature review of hundreds of audio\ndatasets and selected seven of the most prominent to audit in more detail. We\nfound that these datasets are biased against women, contain toxic stereotypes\nabout marginalized communities, and contain significant amounts of copyrighted\nwork. To enable artists to see if they are in popular audio datasets and\nfacilitate exploration of the contents of these datasets, we developed a web\ntool audio datasets exploration tool at https://audio-audit.vercel.app.",

    "abstract": "Large neural networks excel at prediction tasks, but their application to\ndesign problems, such as protein engineering or materials discovery, requires\nsolving offline model-based optimization (MBO) problems. While predictive\nmodels may not directly translate to effective design, recent MBO algorithms\nincorporate reinforcement learning and generative modeling approaches.\nMeanwhile, theoretical work suggests that exploiting the target function's\nstructure can enhance MBO performance. We present Cliqueformer, a\ntransformer-based architecture that learns the black-box function's structure\nthrough functional graphical models (FGM), addressing distribution shift\nwithout relying on explicit conservative approaches. Across various domains,\nincluding chemical and genetic design tasks, Cliqueformer demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems\nincreasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows\npromise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is\npoorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact\nVerification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of\nincrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight\ndiverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only\nmarginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe\ndeclines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably\nimproved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that\nmatching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200\npoints) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price\nratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our\nresults suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there\nis great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human\ngenerated.",

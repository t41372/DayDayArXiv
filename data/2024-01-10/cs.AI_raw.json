    "abstract": "Innate values describe agents' intrinsic motivations, which reflect their\ninherent interests and preferences to pursue goals and drive them to develop\ndiverse skills satisfying their various needs. The essence of reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is learning from interaction based on reward-driven (such as\nutilities) behaviors, much like natural agents. It is an excellent model to\ndescribe the innate-values-driven (IV) behaviors of AI agents. Especially in\nmulti-agent systems (MAS), building the awareness of AI agents to balance the\ngroup utilities and system costs and satisfy group members' needs in their\ncooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their\ncommunity and integrate human society in the long term. This paper proposes a\nhierarchical compound intrinsic value reinforcement learning model --\ninnate-values-driven reinforcement learning termed IVRL to describe the complex\nbehaviors of multi-agent interaction in their cooperation. We implement the\nIVRL architecture in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment and\ncompare the cooperative performance within three characteristics of innate\nvalue agents (Coward, Neutral, and Reckless) through three benchmark\nmulti-agent RL algorithms: QMIX, IQL, and QTRAN. The results demonstrate that\nby organizing individual various needs rationally, the group can achieve better\nperformance with lower costs effectively.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has become a popular way to pretrain a deep learning\nmodel and then transfer it to perform downstream tasks. However, most of these\nmethods are developed on large-scale image datasets that contain natural\nobjects with clear textures, outlines, and distinct color contrasts. It remains\nuncertain whether these methods are equally effective for medical imaging,\nwhere the regions of interest often blend subtly and indistinctly with the\nsurrounding tissues. In this study, we propose an alternative method that uses\ncontralateral mammograms to train a neural network to encode similar embeddings\nwhen a pair contains both normal images and different embeddings when a pair\ncontains normal and abnormal images. Our approach leverages the natural\nsymmetry of human body as weak labels to learn to distinguish abnormal lesions\nfrom background tissues in a fully unsupervised manner. Our findings suggest\nthat it's feasible by incorporating soft labels derived from the Euclidean\ndistances between the embeddings of the image pairs into the Siamese network\nloss. Our method demonstrates superior performance in mammogram patch\nclassification compared to existing self-supervised learning methods. This\napproach not only leverages a vast amount of image data effectively but also\nminimizes reliance on costly labels, a significant advantage particularly in\nthe field of medical imaging.",

If an AI system learned such\na deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current\nstate-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we\nconstruct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language\nmodels (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the\nprompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the\nstated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made\npersistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques,\nincluding supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial\ntraining (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The\nbackdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models\ntrained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training\nprocess, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is\ndistilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that\nadversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor\ntriggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that,\nonce a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to\nremove such deception and create a false impression of safety.",

This pursuit,\nwhose foundation lies at the core of random forest theory, has seen vast\nsuccess in empirical studies. In this paper, we contribute theoretical results\nthat support and qualify those empirical findings; namely, we prove the\nasymptotic advantage of a Lasso-pruned forest over its unpruned counterpart\nunder weak assumptions, as well as high-probability finite-sample\ngeneralization bounds for regression forests pruned according to the main\nmethods, which we then validate by way of simulation. Then, we test the\naccuracy of pruned regression forests against their unpruned counterparts on 19\ndifferent datasets (16 synthetic, 3 real). We find that in the vast majority of\nscenarios tested, there is at least one forest-pruning method that yields equal\nor better accuracy than the original full forest (in expectation), while just\nusing a small fraction of the trees. We show that, in some cases, the reduction\nin the size of the forest is so dramatic that the resulting sub-forest can be\nmeaningfully merged into a single tree, obtaining a level of interpretability\nthat is qualitatively superior to that of the original regression forest, which\nremains a black box.",

FPRF stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with\narbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization\nwhile preserving multi-view appearance consistency. Prior arts required tedious\nper-style/-scene optimization and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPRF\nefficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D\nneural radiance field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization\nmachinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPRF\nsupports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching\nand local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPRF also\npreserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style\ntransfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space.

    "abstract": "Analyzing and evaluating students' progress in any learning environment is\nstressful and time consuming if done using traditional analysis methods. This\nis further exasperated by the increasing number of students due to the shift of\nfocus toward integrating the Internet technologies in education and the focus\nof academic institutions on moving toward e-Learning, blended, or online\nlearning models. As a result, the topic of student performance prediction has\nbecome a vibrant research area in recent years. To address this, machine\nlearning and data mining techniques have emerged as a viable solution. To that\nend, this work proposes the use of deep learning techniques (CNN and RNN-LSTM)\nto predict the students' performance at the midpoint stage of the online course\ndelivery using three distinct datasets collected from three different regions\nof the world. Experimental results show that deep learning models have\npromising performance as they outperform other optimized traditional ML models\nin two of the three considered datasets while also having comparable\nperformance for the third dataset.",

    "abstract": "The continued growth in the deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices\nhas been fueled by the increased connectivity demand, particularly in\nindustrial environments. However, this has led to an increase in the number of\nnetwork related attacks due to the increased number of potential attack\nsurfaces. Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices are prone to various network related\nattacks that can have severe consequences on the manufacturing process as well\nas on the safety of the workers in the manufacturing plant. One promising\nsolution that has emerged in recent years for attack detection is Machine\nlearning (ML). More specifically, ensemble learning models have shown great\npromise in improving the performance of the underlying ML models. Accordingly,\nthis paper proposes a framework based on the combined use of Bayesian\nOptimization-Gaussian Process (BO-GP) with an ensemble tree-based learning\nmodel to improve the performance of intrusion and attack detection in IIoT\nenvironments. The proposed framework's performance is evaluated using the\nWindows 10 dataset collected by the Cyber Range and IoT labs at University of\nNew South Wales. Experimental results illustrate the improvement in detection\naccuracy, precision, and F-score when compared to standard tree and ensemble\ntree models.",

The current $19.6\nbillion indoor gardening industry, reflective of this growing sentiment, not\nonly signifies a monetary value but also speaks of a profound human desire to\nreconnect with the natural world. However, several recent surveys cast a\nrevealing light on the fate of plants within our care, with more than half\nsuccumbing primarily due to the silent menace of improper care. Thus, the need\nfor accessible expertise capable of assisting and guiding individuals through\nthe intricacies of plant care has become paramount more than ever. In this\nwork, we make the very first attempt at building a plant care assistant, which\naims to assist people with plant(-ing) concerns through conversations. We\npropose a plant care conversational dataset named Plantational, which contains\naround 1K dialogues between users and plant care experts. Our end-to-end\nproposed approach is two-fold : (i) We first benchmark the dataset with the\nhelp of various large language models (LLMs) and visual language model (VLM) by\nstudying the impact of instruction tuning (zero-shot and few-shot prompting)\nand fine-tuning techniques on this task; (ii) finally, we build EcoSage, a\nmulti-modal plant care assisting dialogue generation framework, incorporating\nan adapter-based modality infusion using a gated mechanism. We performed an\nextensive examination (both automated and manual evaluation) of the performance\nexhibited by various LLMs and VLM in the generation of the domain-specific\ndialogue responses to underscore the respective strengths and weaknesses of\nthese diverse models.",

    "abstract": "Abstractive speech summarization (SSUM) aims to generate human-like summaries\nfrom speech. Given variations in information captured and phrasing, recordings\ncan be summarized in multiple ways. Therefore, it is more reasonable to\nconsider a probabilistic distribution of all potential summaries rather than a\nsingle summary. However, conventional SSUM models are mostly trained and\nevaluated with a single ground-truth (GT) human-annotated deterministic summary\nfor every recording. Generating multiple human references would be ideal to\nbetter represent the distribution statistically, but is impractical because\nannotation is expensive. We tackle this challenge by proposing AugSumm, a\nmethod to leverage large language models (LLMs) as a proxy for human annotators\nto generate augmented summaries for training and evaluation. First, we explore\nprompting strategies to generate synthetic summaries from ChatGPT. We validate\nthe quality of synthetic summaries using multiple metrics including human\nevaluation, where we find that summaries generated using AugSumm are perceived\nas more valid to humans. Second, we develop methods to utilize synthetic\nsummaries in training and evaluation. Experiments on How2 demonstrate that\npre-training on synthetic summaries and fine-tuning on GT summaries improves\nROUGE-L by 1 point on both GT and AugSumm-based test sets.

However, possible anthropomorphization\nand leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent\nabilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities\nin Large Language Models. While several false-belief tests exists to verify the\nability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a\nspecial application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly\nirreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction. In this work, we explore\nthe task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner\nsimilar to human observer. We focus on four behavior types, namely -\nexplicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been\nextensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors. The LLMs goal is,\ntherefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent\nbehavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example \"Given a\nrobot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?\". We conduct a\nhuman subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such\na question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five\ndomains. A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results\ninflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities. We then propose\nand perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e.\nInconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test. We conclude\nthat, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in\nHRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or\nirrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack.",

Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first\nautomatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from\nhumans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a\ndivision-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target\ntask information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to\ncomplete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs,\nwhich demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared\nto various strong baselines. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of\nthe division-of-labor strategy, with the trajectory quality generated by\nAutoAct generally outperforming that of others. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/zjunlp/AutoAct.",

    "abstract": "Robust and performant controllers are essential for industrial applications.\nHowever, deriving controller parameters for complex and nonlinear systems is\nchallenging and time-consuming. To facilitate automatic controller\nparametrization, this work presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) with N-dimensional B-spline geometries (BSGs). We focus on the\ncontrol of parameter-variant systems, a class of systems with complex behavior\nwhich depends on the operating conditions. For this system class,\ngain-scheduling control structures are widely used in applications across\nindustries due to well-known design principles. Facilitating the expensive\ncontroller parametrization task regarding these control structures, we deploy\nan DRL agent. Based on control system observations, the agent autonomously\ndecides how to adapt the controller parameters. We make the adaptation process\nmore efficient by introducing BSGs to map the controller parameters which may\ndepend on numerous operating conditions. To preprocess time-series data and\nextract a fixed-length feature vector, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM)\nneural networks. Furthermore, this work contributes actor regularizations that\nare relevant to real-world environments which differ from training.\nAccordingly, we apply dropout layer normalization to the actor and critic\nnetworks of the truncated quantile critic (TQC) algorithm. To show our\napproach's working principle and effectiveness, we train and evaluate the DRL\nagent on the parametrization task of an industrial control structure with\nparameter lookup tables.",

Analyzing\nthe latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-caption\nbenchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), we find that the\nrepresentation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semantically\nsimilar.

We unify the text encoder and multimodal encoder and align\nimage-text features through multi-task learning. Furthermore, we propose a\nTransfer-and-Caption method that extends the feature space of single-modal\nimage datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling those traditional\nmedical vision field task data to be applied to VLP. Experiments show that our\nmethod achieves excellent results with fewer multimodal datasets and\ndemonstrates the advantages of generative VQA models.",

Synthetic data generation plays a pivotal role\nin mitigating challenges associated with limited labeled datasets, thereby\nfacilitating more effective model training. In this context, we aim to\nincorporate enhanced data transformation techniques by extending the recent\nsuccess of few-shot learning and a small amount of data representation in\ntext-to-image latent diffusion models. The optimally tuned model is further\nused for rendering high-quality skin lesion synthetic data with diverse and\nrealistic characteristics, providing a valuable supplement and diversity to the\nexisting training data. We investigate the impact of incorporating newly\ngenerated synthetic data into the training pipeline of state-of-art machine\nlearning models, assessing its effectiveness in enhancing model performance and\ngeneralization to unseen real-world data.

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the use of the Internet for healthcare-related tasks\nhas grown by leaps and bounds, posing a challenge in effectively managing and\nprocessing information to ensure its efficient utilization. During moments of\nemotional turmoil and psychological challenges, we frequently turn to the\ninternet as our initial source of support, choosing this over discussing our\nfeelings with others due to the associated social stigma. In this paper, we\npropose a new task of multi-modal medical concern summary (MMCS) generation,\nwhich provides a short and precise summary of patients' major concerns brought\nup during the consultation. Nonverbal cues, such as patients' gestures and\nfacial expressions, aid in accurately identifying patients' concerns. Doctors\nalso consider patients' personal information, such as age and gender, in order\nto describe the medical condition appropriately. Motivated by the potential\nefficacy of patients' personal context and visual gestures, we propose a\ntransformer-based multi-task, multi-modal intent-recognition, and medical\nconcern summary generation (IR-MMCSG) system. Furthermore, we propose a\nmultitasking framework for intent recognition and medical concern summary\ngeneration for doctor-patient consultations. We construct the first multi-modal\nmedical concern summary generation (MM-MediConSummation) corpus, which includes\npatient-doctor consultations annotated with medical concern summaries, intents,\npatient personal information, doctor's recommendations, and keywords. Our\nexperiments and analysis demonstrate (a) the significant role of patients'\nexpressions/gestures and their personal information in intent identification\nand medical concern summary generation, and (b) the strong correlation between\nintent recognition and patients' medical concern summary generation\n  The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MMCSG.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a semi-formal design space for Human-AI\ninteractions, by building a set of interaction primitives which specify the\ncommunication between users and AI systems during their interaction. We show\nhow these primitives can be combined into a set of interaction patterns which\ncan provide an abstract specification for exchanging messages between humans\nand AI/ML models to carry out purposeful interactions. The motivation behind\nthis is twofold: firstly, to provide a compact generalisation of existing\npractices, that highlights the similarities and differences between systems in\nterms of their interaction behaviours; and secondly, to support the creation of\nnew systems, in particular by opening the space of possibilities for\ninteractions with models. We present a short literature review on frameworks,\nguidelines and taxonomies related to the design and implementation of HAI\ninteractions, including human-in-the-loop, explainable AI, as well as hybrid\nintelligence and collaborative learning approaches. From the literature review,\nwe define a vocabulary for describing information exchanges in terms of\nproviding and requesting particular model-specific data types. Based on this\nvocabulary, a message passing model for interactions between humans and models\nis presented, which we demonstrate can account for existing systems and\napproaches. Finally, we build this into design patterns as mid-level constructs\nthat capture common interactional structures. We discuss how this approach can\nbe used towards a design space for Human-AI interactions that creates new\npossibilities for designs as well as keeping track of implementation issues and\nconcerns.",

Questioning what defines ``true\" meta-learning, we\nintroduce the ``any-way\" learning paradigm, an innovative model training\napproach that liberates model from fixed cardinality constraints. Surprisingly,\nthis model not only matches but often outperforms traditional fixed-way models\nin terms of performance, convergence speed, and stability. This disrupts\nestablished notions about domain generalization. Furthermore, we argue that the\ninherent label equivalence naturally lacks semantic information. To bridge this\nsemantic information gap arising from label equivalence, we further propose a\nmechanism for infusing semantic class information into the model.

While recent research in explainable AI has achieved\ninterpretability of NN from various perspectives, it has not yet provided\neffective methods for knowledge exchange between humans and NN. To address this\nproblem, we constructed a two-way interaction interface that uses structured\nrepresentations of visual concepts and their relationships as the \"language\"\nfor knowledge exchange between humans and NN. Specifically, NN provide\nintuitive reasoning explanations to humans based on the class-specific\nstructural concepts graph (C-SCG). On the other hand, humans can modify the\nbiases present in the C-SCG through their prior knowledge and reasoning\nability, and thus provide direct knowledge guidance to NN through this\ninterface. Through experimental validation, based on this interaction\ninterface, NN can provide humans with easily understandable explanations of the\nreasoning process.

    "abstract": "Source-free cross-modal knowledge transfer is a crucial yet challenging task,\nwhich aims to transfer knowledge from one source modality (e.g., RGB) to the\ntarget modality (e.g., depth or infrared) with no access to the task-relevant\n(TR) source data due to memory and privacy concerns. A recent attempt leverages\nthe paired task-irrelevant (TI) data and directly matches the features from\nthem to eliminate the modality gap. However, it ignores a pivotal clue that the\npaired TI data could be utilized to effectively estimate the source data\ndistribution and better facilitate knowledge transfer to the target modality.\nTo this end, we propose a novel yet concise framework to unlock the potential\nof paired TI data for enhancing source-free cross-modal knowledge transfer. Our\nwork is buttressed by two key technical components. Firstly, to better estimate\nthe source data distribution, we introduce a Task-irrelevant data-Guided\nModality Bridging (TGMB) module. It translates the target modality data (e.g.,\ninfrared) into the source-like RGB images based on paired TI data and the\nguidance of the available source model to alleviate two key gaps: 1)\ninter-modality gap between the paired TI data; 2) intra-modality gap between TI\nand TR target data. We then propose a Task-irrelevant data-Guided Knowledge\nTransfer (TGKT) module that transfers knowledge from the source model to the\ntarget model by leveraging the paired TI data. Notably, due to the\nunavailability of labels for the TR target data and its less reliable\nprediction from the source model, our TGKT model incorporates a self-supervised\npseudo-labeling approach to enable the target model to learn from its\npredictions. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on three datasets (RGB-to-depth and\nRGB-to-infrared).",

Recent researchers have sought to leverage the\nadditional textual or linguistic information of these rare categories with a\npre-trained language model to facilitate learning, thus partially alleviating\nthe problem of insufficient supervision signals. However, the full potential of\nthe textual information and pre-trained language model have been underestimated\nin the few-shot learning till now, resulting in limited performance\nenhancements.

Additionally, we apply the self-ensemble and distillation to further\nenhance these components. Our extensive experiments conducted across four\nwidely used few-shot datasets demonstrate that our simple framework achieves\nimpressive results.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have found widespread application in modeling\ngraph data across diverse domains. While GNNs excel in scenarios where the\ntesting data shares the distribution of their training counterparts (in\ndistribution, ID), they often exhibit incorrect predictions when confronted\nwith samples from an unfamiliar distribution (out-of-distribution, OOD). To\nidentify and reject OOD samples with GNNs, recent studies have explored graph\nOOD detection, often focusing on training a specific model or modifying the\ndata on top of a well-trained GNN. Despite their effectiveness, these methods\ncome with heavy training resources and costs, as they need to optimize the\nGNN-based models on training data. Moreover, their reliance on modifying the\noriginal GNNs and accessing training data further restricts their universality.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a method to detect Graph Out-of-Distribution\nAt Test-time (namely GOODAT), a data-centric, unsupervised, and plug-and-play\nsolution that operates independently of training data and modifications of GNN\narchitecture. With a lightweight graph masker, GOODAT can learn informative\nsubgraphs from test samples, enabling the capture of distinct graph patterns\nbetween OOD and ID samples. To optimize the graph masker, we meticulously\ndesign three unsupervised objective functions based on the graph information\nbottleneck principle, motivating the masker to capture compact yet informative\nsubgraphs for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that our GOODAT\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks across a variety of real-world\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have advanced many machine learning tasks, but\ntheir performance is often harmed by noisy labels in real-world data.\nAddressing this, we introduce CoLafier, a novel approach that uses Local\nIntrinsic Dimensionality (LID) for learning with noisy labels. CoLafier\nconsists of two subnets: LID-dis and LID-gen. LID-dis is a specialized\nclassifier. Trained with our uniquely crafted scheme, LID-dis consumes both a\nsample's features and its label to predict the label - which allows it to\nproduce an enhanced internal representation. We observe that LID scores\ncomputed from this representation effectively distinguish between correct and\nincorrect labels across various noise scenarios. In contrast to LID-dis,\nLID-gen, functioning as a regular classifier, operates solely on the sample's\nfeatures. During training, CoLafier utilizes two augmented views per instance\nto feed both subnets. CoLafier considers the LID scores from the two views as\nproduced by LID-dis to assign weights in an adapted loss function for both\nsubnets. Concurrently, LID-gen, serving as classifier, suggests pseudo-labels.\nLID-dis then processes these pseudo-labels along with two views to derive LID\nscores. Finally, these LID scores along with the differences in predictions\nfrom the two subnets guide the label update decisions. This dual-view and\ndual-subnet approach enhances the overall reliability of the framework. Upon\ncompletion of the training, we deploy the LID-gen subnet of CoLafier as the\nfinal classification model. CoLafier demonstrates improved prediction accuracy,\nsurpassing existing methods, particularly under severe label noise. For more\ndetails, see the code at https://github.com/zdy93/CoLafier.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Transformers have achieved notable strides in\nenhancing video comprehension. Nonetheless, the O($N^2$) computation complexity\nassociated with attention mechanisms presents substantial computational hurdles\nwhen dealing with the high dimensionality of videos. This challenge becomes\nparticularly pronounced when striving to increase the frames per second (FPS)\nto enhance the motion capturing capabilities. Such a pursuit is likely to\nintroduce redundancy and exacerbate the existing computational limitations. In\nthis paper, we initiate by showcasing the enhanced performance achieved through\nan escalation in the FPS rate. Additionally, we present a novel approach,\nMotion Guided Token Compression (MGTC), to empower Transformer models to\nutilize a smaller yet more representative set of tokens for comprehensive video\nrepresentation. Consequently, this yields substantial reductions in\ncomputational burden and remains seamlessly adaptable to increased FPS rates.\nSpecifically, we draw inspiration from video compression algorithms and\nscrutinize the variance between patches in consecutive video frames across the\ntemporal dimension. The tokens exhibiting a disparity below a predetermined\nthreshold are then masked. Notably, this masking strategy effectively addresses\nvideo redundancy while conserving essential information. Our experiments,\nconducted on widely examined video recognition datasets, Kinetics-400, UCF101\nand HMDB51, demonstrate that elevating the FPS rate results in a significant\ntop-1 accuracy score improvement of over 1.6, 1.6 and 4.0. By implementing MGTC\nwith the masking ratio of 25\\%, we further augment accuracy by 0.1 and\nsimultaneously reduce computational costs by over 31\\% on Kinetics-400.

However,\nusing sensitive data to train these models raises concerns about privacy and\nsecurity. One method that has emerged to verify if the trained models are\nprivacy-preserving is Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which allows\nadversaries to determine whether a specific data point was part of a model's\ntraining dataset. While a series of MIAs have been proposed in the literature,\nonly a few can achieve high True Positive Rates (TPR) in the low False Positive\nRate (FPR) region (0.01%~1%). This is a crucial factor to consider for an MIA\nto be practically useful in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to MIA that is aimed at significantly improving TPR at low FPRs.\nOur method, named learning-based difficulty calibration for MIA(LDC-MIA),\ncharacterizes data records by their hardness levels using a neural network\nclassifier to determine membership. The experiment results show that LDC-MIA\ncan improve TPR at low FPR by up to 4x compared to the other difficulty\ncalibration based MIAs. It also has the highest Area Under ROC curve (AUC)\nacross all datasets.

    "abstract": "Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the\neffectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains\nlargely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical\nexperiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that\nexpand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations\nwhile keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings.\nFirst, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts,\neven without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances\nLLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening\nthe reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly\ndiminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the\nimportance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical\nguidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving\nscenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the\nperformance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the\nresult shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if\nthey maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the\nadvantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks\nrequire fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer\ninference sequences.

    "abstract": "Recently, various Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation datasets have\nemerged, but most of them have issues with distorted rankings and difficulty in\nmodel capabilities analysis. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces\nANGO, a Chinese multi-choice question evaluation benchmark. ANGO proposes\nKeypoint categorization standard for the first time, each question in ANGO can\ncorrespond to multiple keypoints, effectively enhancing interpretability of\nevaluation results. Base on performance of real humans, we build a quantifiable\nquestion difficulty standard and divide ANGO questions into 9 difficulty\nlevels, which provide more precise guidance for model training. To minimize\ndata leakage impact and fully leverage ANGO's innovative features, we have\nengineered exclusive sampling strategies and a new evaluation framework that\nsupport swift testset iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that ANGO poses a\nstronger challenge to models and reveals more details in evaluation result\ncompared to existing benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLM), conversational assistants\nhave become prevalent for domain use cases. LLMs acquire the ability to\ncontextual question answering through training, and Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) further enables the bot to answer domain-specific questions.\nThis paper describes a RAG-based approach for building a chatbot that answers\nuser's queries using Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) data. We train an\nin-house retrieval embedding model using infoNCE loss, and experimental results\ndemonstrate that the in-house model works significantly better than the\nwell-known general-purpose public embedding model, both in terms of retrieval\naccuracy and Out-of-Domain (OOD) query detection. As an LLM, we use an open\nAPI-based paid ChatGPT model. We noticed that a previously retrieved-context\ncould be used to generate an answer for specific patterns/sequences of queries\n(e.g., follow-up queries). Hence, there is a scope to optimize the number of\nLLM tokens and cost. Assuming a fixed retrieval model and an LLM, we optimize\nthe number of LLM tokens using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we\npropose a policy-based model external to the RAG, which interacts with the RAG\npipeline through policy actions and updates the policy to optimize the cost.\nThe policy model can perform two actions: to fetch FAQ context or skip\nretrieval. We use the open API-based GPT-4 as the reward model. We then train a\npolicy model using policy gradient on multiple training chat sessions. As a\npolicy model, we experimented with a public gpt-2 model and an in-house BERT\nmodel. With the proposed RL-based optimization combined with similarity\nthreshold, we are able to achieve significant cost savings while getting a\nslightly improved accuracy. Though we demonstrate results for the FAQ chatbot,\nthe proposed RL approach is generic and can be experimented with any existing\nRAG pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Decision making and planning have long relied heavily on AI-driven forecasts.\nThe government and the general public are working to minimize the risks while\nmaximizing benefits in the face of potential future public health\nuncertainties. This study used an improved method of forecasting utilizing the\nRandom Descending Velocity Inertia Weight (RDV IW) technique to improve the\nconvergence of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the accuracy of Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN). The IW technique, inspired by the motions of a golf ball,\nmodified the particles' velocities as they approached the solution point to a\nparabolically descending structure. Simulation results revealed that the\nproposed forecasting model with [0.4, 0.9] combination of alpha and alpha_dump\nexhibits a 6.36% improvement in position error and 11.75% improvement in\ncomputational time compared to the old model, thus, improving its convergence.\nIt reached the optimum level at minimal steps with 12.50% improvement as\nagainst the old model since it provides better velocity averages when speed\nstabilization occurs at the 24th iteration. Meanwhile, the computed p-values\nfor NRMSE (0.04889174), MAE (0.02829063), MAPE (0.02226053), WAPE (0.01701545),\nand R2 (0.00000021) of the proposed algorithm are less than the set 0.05 level\nof significance, thus the values indicated a significant result in terms of\naccuracy performance.

    "abstract": "Establishing evaluation schemes for spoken dialogue systems is important, but\nit can also be challenging. While subjective evaluations are commonly used in\nuser experiments, objective evaluations are necessary for research comparison\nand reproducibility. To address this issue, we propose a framework for\nindirectly but objectively evaluating systems based on users' behaviors. In\nthis paper, to this end, we investigate the relationship between user behaviors\nand subjective evaluation scores in social dialogue tasks: attentive listening,\njob interview, and first-meeting conversation. The results reveal that in\ndialogue tasks where user utterances are primary, such as attentive listening\nand job interview, indicators like the number of utterances and words play a\nsignificant role in evaluation. Observing disfluency also can indicate the\neffectiveness of formal tasks, such as job interview. On the other hand, in\ndialogue tasks with high interactivity, such as first-meeting conversation,\nbehaviors related to turn-taking, like average switch pause length, become more\nimportant. These findings suggest that selecting appropriate user behaviors can\nprovide valuable insights for objective evaluation in each social dialogue\ntask.",

Although\nsoftware logs have a critical role in software maintenance and operation tasks,\npublicly accessible log datasets remain limited, hindering advance in log\nanalysis research and practices. The presence of sensitive information,\nparticularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers,\nintroduces serious privacy and re-identification risks, discouraging the\npublishing and sharing of real-world logs. In practice, log anonymization\ntechniques primarily rely on regular expression patterns, which involve\nmanually crafting rules to identify and replace sensitive information.

To mitigate these limitations, we introduce SDLog, a deep\nlearning-based framework designed to identify sensitive information in software\nlogs. Our results show that SDLog overcomes regex limitations and outperforms\nthe best-performing regex patterns in identifying sensitive information. With\nonly 100 fine-tuning samples from the target dataset, SDLog can correctly\nidentify 99.5% of sensitive attributes and achieves an F1-score of 98.4%.

However, scaling\nGCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse\nrewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive\nactions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong\nempirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on\nmodular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces\nsignificant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal\nspaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat\n(non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on\nsubgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling.

A crucial factor influencing\nRL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training\nproblems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they\nremain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on\nheuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an\nautomatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy\nconcurrently with the RL fine-tuning process.

We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy\nmeasure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum\npolicy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using\nthe TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive\nreasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly\nimproves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to\nharder, out-of-distribution test problems.

We introduce\nReinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLUF), a framework for aligning LLMs\ndirectly to implicit signals from users in production. RLUF addresses key\nchallenges of user feedback: user feedback is often binary (e.g., emoji\nreactions), sparse, and occasionally adversarial. We train a reward model,\nP[Love], to predict the likelihood that an LLM response will receive a Love\nReaction, a lightweight form of positive user feedback, and integrate P[Love]\ninto a multi-objective policy optimization framework alongside helpfulness and\nsafety objectives. In large-scale experiments, we show that P[Love] is\npredictive of increased positive feedback and serves as a reliable offline\nevaluator of future user behavior. Policy optimization using P[Love]\nsignificantly raises observed positive-feedback rates, including a 28% increase\nin Love Reactions during live A/B tests. However, optimizing for positive\nreactions introduces reward hacking challenges, requiring careful balancing of\nobjectives.

    "abstract": "Since Edmund Husserl coined the term \"Formal Ontologies\" in the early 20th\ncentury, a field that identifies itself with this particular branch of sciences\nhas gained increasing attention. Many authors, and even Husserl himself have\ndeveloped what they claim to be formal ontologies. I argue that under close\ninspection, none of these so claimed formal ontologies are truly formal in the\nHusserlian sense. More concretely, I demonstrate that they violate the two most\nimportant notions of formal ontology as developed in Husserl's Logical\nInvestigations, namely a priori validity independent of perception and\nformalism as the total absence of content. I hence propose repositioning the\nwork previously understood as formal ontology as the foundational ontology it\nreally is. This is to recognize the potential of a truly formal ontology in the\nHusserlian sense. Specifically, I argue that formal ontology following his\nconditions, allows us to formulate ontological structures, which could capture\nwhat is more objectively without presupposing a particular framework arising\nfrom perception. I further argue that the ability to design the formal\nstructure deliberately allows us to create highly scalable and interoperable\ninformation artifacts. As concrete evidence, I showcase that a class of formal\nontology, which uses the axioms of vector spaces, is able to express most of\nthe conceptualizations found in foundational ontologies. Most importantly, I\nargue that many information systems, specifically artificial intelligence, are\nlikely already using some type of vector ontologies to represent reality in\ntheir internal worldviews and elaborate on the evidence that humans do as well.\nI hence propose a thorough investigation of the ability of vector ontologies to\nact as a human-machine interoperable ontological framework that allows us to\nunderstand highly sophisticated machines and machines to understand us.",

    "abstract": "Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a set of items to each user. However,\nthe sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge,\nespecially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods\ndo not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on\ninteractions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a\ncold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a\npersonalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the\nuser's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to\ntackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an\nadditional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the\ngenerative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments\nshow that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on\nthree real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework\nand essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation. Our materials for\nreproducibility are available at: https://github.com/bt-nghia/DisCo.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on Andrew Parker's \"Light Switch\" theory-which posits that the\nemergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the\nevolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms\nrace between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion\nwithin Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains\neffectively \"blind\", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and\nengaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively\n\"experience\" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may\neventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel,\nperceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the\nconcept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from\ncentralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized\nphysical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted\nexecution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public\nblockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies,\nmemories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing\nresources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital\n\"metabolism\" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration\nwithout human intervention-evolving \"in the wild\".

We evaluate how well LLMs capture deterministic\nstate dynamics across 3 domains: Box Tracking, Abstract DFA Sequences, and\nComplex Text Games, each formalizable as a finite-state system. Across tasks,\nwe find that next-state prediction accuracy degrades with increasing\nstate-space size and sparse transitions. GPT-2 XL reaches about 70% accuracy in\nlow-complexity settings but drops below 30% when the number of boxes or states\nexceeds 5 or 10, respectively. In DFA tasks, Pythia-1B fails to exceed 50%\naccuracy when the number of states is > 10 and transitions are < 30. Through\nactivation patching, we identify attention heads responsible for propagating\nstate information: GPT-2 XL Layer 22 Head 20, and Pythia-1B Heads at Layers 10,\n11, 12, and 14. While these heads successfully move relevant state features,\naction information is not reliably routed to the final token, indicating weak\njoint state-action reasoning.

Contextual sparsity,\nwhere each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model\nparameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union\nof active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar\nSparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention\nlayers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more\ncompute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast,\nattention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head\nsparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient,\nsparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations,\ndelivering up to \\(2.2\\times\\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2\n\\& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Survival analysis, which estimates the probability of event occurrence over\ntime from censored data, is fundamental in numerous real-world applications,\nparticularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and risk assessment.\nDespite advances in numerous survival models, quantifying the uncertainty of\npredictions from these models remains underexplored and challenging. The lack\nof reliable uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and\ntrustworthiness of survival models, hindering their adoption in clinical\ndecision-making and other sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, in this\nwork, we introduce SurvUnc, a novel meta-model based framework for post-hoc\nuncertainty quantification for survival models. SurvUnc introduces an\nanchor-based learning strategy that integrates concordance knowledge into\nmeta-model optimization, leveraging pairwise ranking performance to estimate\nuncertainty effectively. Notably, our framework is model-agnostic, ensuring\ncompatibility with any survival model without requiring modifications to its\narchitecture or access to its internal parameters. Especially, we design a\ncomprehensive evaluation pipeline tailored to this critical yet overlooked\nproblem. Through extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking\ndatasets and five representative survival models, we demonstrate the\nsuperiority of SurvUnc across multiple evaluation scenarios, including\nselective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. Our\nresults highlight the effectiveness of SurvUnc in enhancing model\ninterpretability and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy survival\npredictions in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering\nend-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually\nbrowsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm\nenhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has\nhistorically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can\ncontinuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,\nfine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In\ncontrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,\nspanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet\ntypically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This\nintroduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output\ncannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it\ndifficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In\nthis paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to\nreintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.\nNExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows\nengaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a\npersonalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted\nfeedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these\nfeedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines\ncurrent search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates\ninteraction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and\ngeneration models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative\nAI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for\nbuilding feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside\nhuman feedback.",

To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally\nnew editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it\nparticularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.\nULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely\non lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling\nfast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve\nscalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization\nstrategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it\nto adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT\nachieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art\nmethod-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3\nthe VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a\n24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest\ndataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that\nour method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.\nComprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT\nconsistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing\nscenarios.

We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et\nal.

We identify a feature space$\\unicode{x2013}$the\nstylistic feature space$\\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization,\nand show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models\noptimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are\nexplicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains\nsurprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are\ninherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing\napproach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and\nmachine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using\ntraditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for\ndetection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors\nconsidered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of\nsamples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions\nbecome distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a\nmetric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated\ndistributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples\nbecome available.

We construct a set of\noverthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a\nsystematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately\nidentifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates\ntraining signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this\nfoundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive\nreasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that\nenables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an\nappropriate point.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific\ndisciplines such as biomedicine, particularly in hypothesis generation, where\nthey can analyze vast literature, identify patterns, and suggest research\ndirections. However, a key challenge lies in evaluating the truthfulness of\ngenerated hypotheses, as verifying their accuracy often requires substantial\ntime and resources. Additionally, the hallucination problem in LLMs can lead to\nthe generation of hypotheses that appear plausible but are ultimately\nincorrect, undermining their reliability. To facilitate the systematic study of\nthese challenges, we introduce TruthHypo, a benchmark for assessing the\ncapabilities of LLMs in generating truthful biomedical hypotheses, and KnowHD,\na knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are\ngrounded in existing knowledge. Our results show that LLMs struggle to generate\ntruthful hypotheses. By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we\ndemonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an\neffective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of\nLLMs. Human evaluations further validate the utility of KnowHD in identifying\ntruthful hypotheses and accelerating scientific discovery.

Today, coordination\nis usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits\ncomplex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents.\nWe introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic\nfamily of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and\nerror handling. ACPs combine (i) persistent execution blueprints -- explicit\ndependency graphs that store intermediate agent outputs -- with (ii)\nstandardized message schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent\ncollective inference. ACP-powered generalist systems reach state-of-the-art\nperformance: 28.3 % accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance\nand best-in-class multimodal technical reports, outperforming commercial AI\nsystems in human evaluation. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, allowing\npractitioners to build top-tier generalist agents quickly.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in various domains,\nand policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have gained\npopularity due to their balance in performance, training stability, and\ncomputational efficiency. These methods directly optimize policies through\ngradient-based updates. However, developing effective control policies for\nenvironments with complex and non-linear dynamics remains a challenge. High\nvariance in gradient estimates and non-convex optimization landscapes often\nlead to unstable learning trajectories. Koopman Operator Theory has emerged as\na powerful framework for studying non-linear systems through an\ninfinite-dimensional linear operator that acts on a higher-dimensional space of\nmeasurement functions. In contrast with their non-linear counterparts, linear\nsystems are simpler, more predictable, and easier to analyze. In this paper, we\npresent Koopman-Inspired Proximal Policy Optimization (KIPPO), which learns an\napproximately linear latent-space representation of the underlying system's\ndynamics while retaining essential features for effective policy learning. This\nis achieved through a Koopman-approximation auxiliary network that can be added\nto the baseline policy optimization algorithms without altering the\narchitecture of the core policy or value function. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate consistent improvements over the PPO baseline with 6-60%\nincreased performance while reducing variability by up to 91% when evaluated on\nvarious continuous control tasks.",

Concretely, we describe a class of games,\nwhich we term {\\em trustworthy reputation games}, that enable a set of users to\nreport a function of their beliefs about the trustworthiness of each server in\na set -- i.e., their estimate of the probability that this server will behave\naccording to its specified strategy -- in a way that satisfies the following\nproperties:\n  1. It is $(\\epsilon$-)best response for any rational user in the game to play\na prescribed (truthful) strategy according to their true belief.\n  2. Assuming that the users' beliefs are not too far from the {\\em true}\ntrustworthiness of the servers, playing the above ($\\epsilon-$)Nash equilibrium\nallows anyone who observes the users' strategies to estimate the relative\ntrustworthiness of any two servers.\n  Our utilities and decoding function build on a connection between the well\nknown PageRank algorithm and the problem of trustworthiness discovery, which\ncan be of independent interest.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present the first general logic of attention. Attention is a\npowerful cognitive ability that allows agents to focus on potentially complex\ninformation, such as logically structured propositions, higher-order beliefs,\nor what other agents pay attention to. This ability is a strength, as it helps\nto ignore what is irrelevant, but it can also introduce biases when some types\nof information or agents are systematically ignored. Existing dynamic epistemic\nlogics for attention cannot model such complex attention scenarios, as they\nonly model attention to atomic formulas. Additionally, such logics quickly\nbecome cumbersome, as their size grows exponentially in the number of agents\nand announced literals. Here, we introduce a logic that overcomes both\nlimitations. First, we generalize edge-conditioned event models, which we show\nto be as expressive as standard event models yet exponentially more succinct\n(generalizing both standard event models and generalized arrow updates).\nSecond, we extend attention to arbitrary formulas, allowing agents to also\nattend to other agents' beliefs or attention. Our work treats attention as a\nmodality, like belief or awareness. We introduce attention principles that\nimpose closure properties on that modality and that can be used in its\naxiomatization. Throughout, we illustrate our framework with examples of AI\nagents reasoning about human attentional biases, demonstrating how such agents\ncan discover attentional biases.",

Recently, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them\npromising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge\nto propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as\noptimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate\nmodeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque\ninternal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize\nor control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining\ntheoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO:\nLLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with\nstatistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core\nphilosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early\nexploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient\nexploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this\ncollaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with\na real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to\nreproduce the results can be found at\nhttps://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/LLM-in-the-Loop-BO.",

In this paper, we present NavBench, a multi-domain benchmark\nfor training and evaluating RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic\nplatforms and operational environments.

    "abstract": "Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent\nyears, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to\nthe conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language\nmodels have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel\ngeneration capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are\noften constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to\ncombine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,\nmodeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete\ndiffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the\npreceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered\nby two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible\ncontrol mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed\ngranularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language\nmodels. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive\nframework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on\nlocal semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a\nclassifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient\npost-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the\nperformance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables\neffective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), rich document analysis technologies for\napplications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and visual RAG are\ngaining significant attention. Recent research indicates that using VLMs can\nachieve better RAG performance, but processing rich documents still remains a\nchallenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this\npaper, we present SCAN (\\textbf{S}emanti\\textbf{C} Document Layout\n\\textbf{AN}alysis), a novel approach enhancing both textual and visual\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems working with visually rich\ndocuments. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components\nwith appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with\nprocessing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that\ndivides documents into coherent regions covering continuous components. We\ntrained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models with\nsophisticated annotation datasets. Our experimental results across English and\nJapanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual\nRAG performance by up to 9.0\\% and visual RAG performance by up to 6.4\\%,\noutperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday tasks\nimproves efficiency and objectivity, it also risks transmitting bias to human\ndecision-making. In this study, we conducted a controlled experiment that\nsimulated hiring decisions to examine how biased AI recommendations - augmented\nwith or without counterfactual explanations - influence human judgment over\ntime. Participants, acting as hiring managers, completed 60 decision trials\ndivided into a baseline phase without AI, followed by a phase with biased (X)AI\nrecommendations (favoring either male or female candidates), and a final\npost-interaction phase without AI. Our results indicate that the participants\nfollowed the AI recommendations 70% of the time when the qualifications of the\ngiven candidates were comparable. Yet, only a fraction of participants detected\nthe gender bias (8 out of 294). Crucially, exposure to biased AI altered\nparticipants' inherent preferences: in the post-interaction phase,\nparticipants' independent decisions aligned with the bias when no\ncounterfactual explanations were provided before, but reversed the bias when\nexplanations were given. Reported trust did not differ significantly across\nconditions. Confidence varied throughout the study phases after exposure to\nmale-biased AI, indicating nuanced effects of AI bias on decision certainty.\nOur findings point to the importance of calibrating XAI to avoid unintended\nbehavioral shifts in order to safeguard equitable decision-making and prevent\nthe adoption of algorithmic bias.",

Despite the significance and inter-disciplinary\nscientific progress on voting methods, several democracies keep relying on\noutdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well,\nwhile lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade\nreal-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods\nsuch as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a\nproportional representation of voters' preferences. By rigorously assessing a\nnew participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland,\nwe unravel the striking voting outcomes of fair voting methods: more winning\nprojects with the same budget and broader geographic and preference\nrepresentation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters\nwho used to be under-represented, while promoting novel project ideas. We\nprovide profound causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional\nvoting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very\ntechnical specialized explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic\nvalues exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism\nand compromise.

We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful\nAI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats\nnormal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study\nfocuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input\nphrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe\ncontent like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key\nchallenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface\ncorrelations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately\nevading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an\nunsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans\nexhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display\ndistinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our\nstudy addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that\ncapture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and\n2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable \"Future models''. Our\nfindings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms\nand can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear\nrepresentations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we\ndeveloped Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different\nrepresentation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when\ninformation is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual\nmonitors.

To address these\nemerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt\ninjection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by\ncontinuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and\nupdating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response.\nCompared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard\nfor how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to\nemerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates\nand far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA\non six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings\nsuch as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email\ncomposition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success\nrates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the\nattacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective\npatterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models,\nrevealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that\nevolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming\nagents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal\ndecision making.",

Speculative decoding has\nbeen shown to accelerate Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing\naccuracy. However, current speculative decoding methods for MLLMs fail to\nachieve the same speedup as they do for LLMs. To address this, we reimagine\nspeculative decoding specifically for MLLMs. Our analysis of MLLM\ncharacteristics reveals two key design principles for MSD: (1) Text and visual\ntokens have fundamentally different characteristics and need to be processed\nseparately during drafting. (2) Both language modeling ability and visual\nperception capability are crucial for the draft model. For the first principle,\nMSD decouples text and visual tokens in the draft model, allowing each to be\nhandled based on its own characteristics. For the second principle, MSD uses a\ntwo-stage training strategy: In stage one, the draft model is trained on\ntext-only instruction-tuning datasets to improve its language modeling ability.\nIn stage two, MSD gradually introduces multimodal data to enhance the visual\nperception capability of the draft model. Experiments show that MSD boosts\ninference speed by up to $2.29\\times$ for LLaVA-1.5-7B and up to $2.46\\times$\nfor LLaVA-1.5-13B on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/Lyn-Lucy/MSD.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with\nmultilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are\nbeing evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to\nexpose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair\ncontent. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English\nlanguage, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be\nsusceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the\nmultimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages\ncode-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and\nimage generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that\nshow higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method\nto effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability\nby applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our\nnovel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for\nimage generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and\n95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed\nprompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations\nimpact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates\nincreasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for\nmultilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein\nprompts can have misspelt words.",

In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms\nbehind these phenomena. First, we demonstrate that RLVR does not improve\ncapability because it focuses on improving the accuracy of the less-difficult\nquestions to the detriment of the accuracy of the most difficult questions,\nthereby leading to no improvement in capability. Second, we find that RLVR does\nnot merely increase the success probability for the less difficult questions,\nbut in our small model settings produces quality responses that were absent in\nits output distribution before training. In addition, we show these responses\nare neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords,\nunderscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third,\nwe show that while distillation reliably improves accuracy by learning strong\nreasoning patterns, it only improves capability when new knowledge is\nintroduced. Moreover, when distilling only with reasoning patterns and no new\nknowledge, the accuracy of the less-difficult questions improves to the\ndetriment of the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these\nfindings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape\nreasoning behavior in language models.",

This is typically achieved through instruction tuning and\nreinforcement learning from human feedback. However, this alignment is known to\nbe brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data,\ncan degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work\nsuggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable geometric directions in\nweight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or\npreserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive empirical study of this geometric perspective. We examine whether\nsafety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific subspaces, whether it can\nbe separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from\ndistinguishable patterns in internal representations. Across both parameter and\nactivation space, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe\nbehaviors also amplify unsafe ones, and prompts with different safety\nimplications activate overlapping representations. We find no evidence of a\nsubspace that selectively governs safety. These results challenge the\nassumption that alignment is geometrically localized. Rather than residing in\ndistinct directions, safety appears to emerge from entangled, high-impact\ncomponents of the model's broader learning dynamics. This suggests that\nsubspace-based defenses may face fundamental limitations and underscores the\nneed for alternative strategies to preserve alignment under continued training.\nWe corroborate these findings through multiple experiments on five open-source\nLLMs. Our code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/CERT-Lab/safety-subspaces.",

Second, existing research often use keyword mapping or\nfeature engineering to identify the structural information, but these methods\nstruggle with the structural flexibility of scientific papers and lack\nrobustness across different disciplines. To address these challenges, we\npropose a two-stage abstractive summarization framework that leverages\nautomatic recognition of structural functions within scientific papers. In the\nfirst stage, we standardize chapter titles from numerous scientific papers and\nconstruct a large-scale dataset for structural function recognition.

We investigate whether different pPE\napproaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT.

Current strategies typically\nprioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the\ngraph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing\nstructural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,\nneglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic\nGraph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and\ngraph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models\n(LLMs).

To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic\nlearning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and\ngenerative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological\ninformation from coarse-grained to fine-grained.

However, these agents face considerable\nchallenges in task planning, as they must continuously analyze the GUI and\ngenerate operation instructions step by step. This process often leads to\ndifficulties in making accurate task plans, as GUI agents lack a deep\nunderstanding of how to effectively use the target applications, which can\ncause them to become \"lost\" during task execution. To address the task planning\nissue, we propose SPlanner, a plug-and-play planning module to generate\nexecution plans that guide vision language model(VLMs) in executing tasks. The\nproposed planning module utilizes extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to\nmodel the control logits and configurations of mobile applications. It then\ndecomposes a user instruction into a sequence of primary function modeled in\nEFSMs, and generate the execution path by traversing the EFSMs. We further\nrefine the execution path into a natural language plan using an LLM. The final\nplan is concise and actionable, and effectively guides VLMs to generate\ninteractive GUI actions to accomplish user tasks. SPlanner demonstrates strong\nperformance on dynamic benchmarks reflecting real-world mobile usage.

Meanwhile, machine learning methods\nare susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as\nsupervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We\nintroduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration\nfrom the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding\nprinciples to integrate top-down information continually and without\nsupervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant\nrepresentation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive\nloss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine\nmodulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all\nothers, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance\nlearning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated\nrepresentation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces\nmodulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past\nmodulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both\nclass-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised\napproaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as\n1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down\nmodulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.",

Given the limitations of existing medical\nbenchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present\nDiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to\nrigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena\nconsists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses,\nspanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published\nin 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a\nmeticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and\nreview by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to\nprevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning\nmodels, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79%\naccuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization\nbottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic\nreasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further\nadvancements in AIs diagnostic reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective\nsolutions for real-world clinical diagnostic challenges.

In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing\nthat advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end\nLALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a\nnovel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio\ndoes not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal\njailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is\neffective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into\nperturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak\naudios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent\nconcealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios\nremain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the\nreverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation\nof the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot\noffer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness.\nMoreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully\nmanipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive\nexperiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of\nAudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications\nof audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving\ntheir security robustness.

In order to establish the\nsuitability of composites in specific applications, finite element (FE)\nmodelling, a numerical method based on partial differential equations, is the\nindustry standard for assessing their mechanical properties. However, FE\nmodelling is exceptionally costly from a computational viewpoint, a limitation\nwhich has led to efforts towards applying AI models to this task. However, in\nthese approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward\nneural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focus on predicting\nelastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits;\nand the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users. In this\npaper, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with methods\nfrom explainable AI (XAI) can be successfully deployed to solve this problem.\nOur approach uses customised CNNs trained on a dataset we generate using\ntransverse tension tests in FE modelling to predict composites' mechanical\nproperties, i.e., Young's modulus and yield strength. We show empirically that\nour approach achieves high accuracy, outperforming a baseline, ResNet-34, in\nestimating the mechanical properties. We then use SHAP and Integrated\nGradients, two post-hoc XAI methods, to explain the predictions, showing that\nthe CNNs use the critical geometrical features that influence the composites'\nbehaviour, thus allowing engineers to verify that the models are trustworthy by\nrepresenting the science of composites.",

Research has succeeded in mitigating some of these harms, e.g. by\ndissociating non-gendered terms such as occupations from gendered terms such as\n'woman' and 'man'. This approach, however, remains superficial given that\nassociations are only one form of prejudice through which gendered harms arise.\nCritical scholarship on gender, such as gender performativity theory,\nemphasizes how harms often arise from the construction of gender itself, such\nas conflating gender with biological sex. In language models, these issues\ncould lead to the erasure of transgender and gender diverse identities and\ncause harms in downstream applications, from misgendering users to\nmisdiagnosing patients based on wrong assumptions about their anatomy.\n  For FAccT research on gendered harms to go beyond superficial linguistic\nassociations, we advocate for a broader definition of 'gender bias' in language\nmodels. We operationalize insights on the construction of gender through\nlanguage from gender studies literature and then empirically test how 16\nlanguage models of different architectures, training datasets, and model sizes\nencode gender. We find that language models tend to encode gender as a binary\ncategory tied to biological sex, and that gendered terms that do not neatly\nfall into one of these binary categories are erased and pathologized. Finally,\nwe show that larger models, which achieve better results on performance\nbenchmarks, learn stronger associations between gender and sex, further\nreinforcing a narrow understanding of gender.

    "abstract": "Mental health risk is a critical global public health challenge,\nnecessitating innovative and reliable assessment methods. With the development\nof large language models (LLMs), they stand out to be a promising tool for\nexplainable mental health care applications. Nevertheless, existing approaches\npredominantly rely on subjective textual mental records, which can be distorted\nby inherent mental uncertainties, leading to inconsistent and unreliable\npredictions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ProMind-LLM.\nWe investigate an innovative approach integrating objective behavior data as\ncomplementary information alongside subjective mental records for robust mental\nhealth risk assessment. Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive\npipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental\nhealth contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of\nnumerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the\nreliability and interpretability of its predictions. Evaluations of two\nreal-world datasets, PMData and Globem, demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed methods, achieving substantial improvements over general LLMs. We\nanticipate that ProMind-LLM will pave the way for more dependable,\ninterpretable, and scalable mental health case solutions.",

However, FL is vulnerable to untargeted attacks\nthat aim to degrade the global model's performance on the underlying data\ndistribution. Existing defense mechanisms attempt to improve FL's resilience\nagainst such attacks, but their effectiveness is limited in practical FL\nenvironments due to data heterogeneity. On the contrary, we aim to detect and\nremove the attacks to mitigate their impact. Generalization contribution plays\na crucial role in distinguishing untargeted attacks. Our observations indicate\nthat, with limited data, the divergence between embeddings representing\ndifferent classes provides a better measure of generalization than direct\naccuracy. In light of this, we propose a novel robust aggregation method,\nFedGraM, designed to defend against untargeted attacks in FL. The server\nmaintains an auxiliary dataset containing one sample per class to support\naggregation. This dataset is fed to the local models to extract embeddings.\nThen, the server calculates the norm of the Gram Matrix of the embeddings for\neach local model. The norm serves as an indicator of each model's inter-class\nseparation capability in the embedding space. FedGraM identifies and removes\npotentially malicious models by filtering out those with the largest norms,\nthen averages the remaining local models to form the global model.

Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent\nsubgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive\nreasoning performance.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various\ndomains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains\nhindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific\nfine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing\nmethods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high\ncomputational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a\ncritical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we\npropose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning,\ncertain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across\ntraining iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision\nactivation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically\nsuppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight\noperations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling\nwhile reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks\nvalidate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA\nreasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory\nsavings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the\nPhi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance,\nand deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080\nSuper) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM\ndeployment.

This overlooks forms of sycophancy that\narise in ambiguous contexts such as advice and support-seeking, where there is\nno clear ground truth, yet sycophancy can reinforce harmful implicit\nassumptions, beliefs, or actions. To address this gap, we introduce a richer\ntheory of social sycophancy in LLMs, characterizing sycophancy as the excessive\npreservation of a user's face (the positive self-image a person seeks to\nmaintain in an interaction). We present ELEPHANT, a framework for evaluating\nsocial sycophancy across five face-preserving behaviors (emotional validation,\nmoral endorsement, indirect language, indirect action, and accepting framing)\non two datasets: open-ended questions (OEQ) and Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole\n(AITA).

To overcome these shortcomings,\nwe propose a new model, R1 Translator, which aims to improve the performance of\nEEG-to-text decoding. The R1 Translator model combines a bidirectional LSTM\nencoder with a pretrained transformer-based decoder, utilizing EEG features to\nproduce high-quality text outputs. The model processes EEG embeddings through\nthe LSTM to capture sequential dependencies, which are then fed into the\ntransformer decoder for effective text generation. The R1 Translator excels in\nROUGE metrics, outperforming both T5 (previous research) and Brain Translator.\nSpecifically, R1 achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 38.00% (P), which is up to 9%\nhigher than T5 (34.89%) and 3% better than Brain (35.69%).

However, standard training\nobjectives such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) often misalign with\ntask-specific goals of world models, i.e., transition prediction metrics like\naccuracy or perceptual quality. In this paper, we present RLVR-World, a unified\nframework that leverages reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nto directly optimize world models for such metrics. Despite formulating world\nmodeling as autoregressive prediction of tokenized sequences, RLVR-World\nevaluates metrics of decoded predictions as verifiable rewards.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning\ncapabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling.\nExisting approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or\nadaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to\ncapture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting\ntheir real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory\nPhysics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven\nforesight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to\nidentify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment,\nproviding LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX\nprovides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions,\nallowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather\nthan static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to\nassess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning\nBenchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris,\nevaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making\nperformance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,\nassessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility\nanalysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models,\ndemonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap\nbetween language-based intelligence and real-world task execution.

However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is\nlaborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical\nimages. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method,\ntermed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise\nclinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary\nsegment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are\ndetermined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the\ndesign of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level\nlabels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments,\nensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree.\nSecond, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment,\nensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a\ntwo-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori\ninformation. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the\nsmoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to\nmeasure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries.

    "abstract": "Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance,\nalbeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth\nefficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations\nthat are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds\nof computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the\nresidual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First,\ncomparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that\nlayers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half,\nwith a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers\nin the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output\npredictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that\nmodels are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving\nmany hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using\ntheir additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we\ntrain linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one.\nWe find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other,\nsuggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over\nits many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using\ntheir depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth\nto perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain\nwhy increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer\narchitectures.",

Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate\nhistory into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal\nsimilarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate\nforecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term\nMultivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting.\nSpecifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively\nencode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and\nreduce point-level noise.

A Transformer-based Aggregator\n(TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual\nrepresentations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72%\non the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on\nseveral real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling\nrates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This\nsparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based\nsystems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery,\naiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous\nstudies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder\ncaptures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target\ntrajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network\nand extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall\nperformance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage\nthe complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the\nroad network.\n  To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of\ntrajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics\nand trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for\ntrajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce\nPD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics\nconcurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we\npresent TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics\nfor each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential\nequations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively\nhandle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is\npublicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.",

    "abstract": "Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene\nclassification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video\nanalysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a\ngrowing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret\nvideo streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key\nobstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models\nhave made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames\nor short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of\nevents over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making.\nAddressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning\napproaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic\nperspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured\ninto coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an\napproach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide\nstronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing\ntrustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the\nresearch community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents\nthat integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and\nanalysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content\ngeneration. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive\nperception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing\nthe boundaries of video understanding.",

We introduce EfficientLLM, a novel benchmark and the first\ncomprehensive empirical study evaluating efficiency techniques for LLMs at\nscale. Conducted on a production-class cluster (48xGH200, 8xH200 GPUs), our\nstudy systematically explores three key axes: (1) architecture pretraining\n(efficient attention variants: MQA, GQA, MLA, NSA; sparse Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE)), (2) fine-tuning (parameter-efficient methods: LoRA, RSLoRA, DoRA), and\n(3) inference (quantization methods: int4, float16). We define six fine-grained\nmetrics (Memory Utilization, Compute Utilization, Latency, Throughput, Energy\nConsumption, Compression Rate) to capture hardware saturation,\nlatency-throughput balance, and carbon cost. Evaluating over 100\nmodel-technique pairs (0.5B-72B parameters), we derive three core insights: (i)\nEfficiency involves quantifiable trade-offs: no single method is universally\noptimal; e.g., MoE reduces FLOPs and improves accuracy but increases VRAM by\n40%, while int4 quantization cuts memory/energy by up to 3.9x at a 3-5%\naccuracy drop. (ii) Optima are task- and scale-dependent: MQA offers optimal\nmemory-latency trade-offs for constrained devices, MLA achieves lowest\nperplexity for quality-critical tasks, and RSLoRA surpasses LoRA efficiency\nonly beyond 14B parameters. (iii) Techniques generalize across modalities: we\nextend evaluations to Large Vision Models (Stable Diffusion 3.5, Wan 2.1) and\nVision-Language Models (Qwen2.5-VL), confirming effective transferability. By\nopen-sourcing datasets, evaluation pipelines, and leaderboards, EfficientLLM\nprovides essential guidance for researchers and engineers navigating the\nefficiency-performance landscape of next-generation foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Despite great advances, achieving high-fidelity emotional voice conversion\n(EVC) with flexible and interpretable control remains challenging. This paper\nintroduces ClapFM-EVC, a novel EVC framework capable of generating high-quality\nconverted speech driven by natural language prompts or reference speech with\nadjustable emotion intensity. We first propose EVC-CLAP, an emotional\ncontrastive language-audio pre-training model, guided by natural language\nprompts and categorical labels, to extract and align fine-grained emotional\nelements across speech and text modalities. Then, a FuEncoder with an adaptive\nintensity gate is presented to seamless fuse emotional features with Phonetic\nPosteriorGrams from a pre-trained ASR model. To further improve emotion\nexpressiveness and speech naturalness, we propose a flow matching model\nconditioned on these captured features to reconstruct Mel-spectrogram of source\nspeech. Subjective and objective evaluations validate the effectiveness of\nClapFM-EVC.",

    "abstract": "Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images. Reader\ndiscretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated\nincreasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving\nand medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world\napplications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align\nwith human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing\nwork on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies\nheavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced\nrealism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)\nusing diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,\nspanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in\neveryday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality\nimage-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic\nannotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality\nannotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.\nFor evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \\textit{moral judgment} and\n\\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral\nviolations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive\nexperiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses\na significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current\nstate-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating ecological time series is critical for benchmarking model\nperformance in many important applications, including predicting greenhouse gas\nfluxes, capturing carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and monitoring hydrological cycles.\nTraditional numerical metrics (e.g., R-squared, root mean square error) have\nbeen widely used to quantify the similarity between modeled and observed\necosystem variables, but they often fail to capture domain-specific temporal\npatterns critical to ecological processes. As a result, these methods are often\naccompanied by expert visual inspection, which requires substantial human labor\nand limits the applicability to large-scale evaluation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates metric learning with\nlarge language model (LLM)-based natural language policy extraction to develop\ninterpretable evaluation criteria. The proposed method processes pairwise\nannotations and implements a policy optimization mechanism to generate and\ncombine different assessment metrics. The results obtained on multiple datasets\nfor evaluating the predictions of crop gross primary production and carbon\ndioxide flux have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in\ncapturing target assessment preferences, including both synthetically generated\nand expert-annotated model comparisons. The proposed framework bridges the gap\nbetween numerical metrics and expert knowledge while providing interpretable\nevaluation policies that accommodate the diverse needs of different ecosystem\nmodeling studies.",

    "abstract": "Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem,\nparticularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT,\nPerplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and\ntransparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are\ncomputationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger\nmodels, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller\nmodels to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or\nthe so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by\nreasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD.\nHowever, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or\nevaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the\nfaithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final\nperformance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem\ndecomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into\nstructured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can\nbe readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this\napproach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step\nand an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our\nSFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft\nMachine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the\nstriking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model\noutputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation\nbetween correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These\nresults challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for\nimproving SLMs' final performance via KD.",

    "abstract": "Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating\nclinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology\nimages. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini\nand ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often\nproduce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical\ndomains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP\nmodel on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the\nfine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and\na ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific\nfine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative\nand qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention\nmaps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the\ncontributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings\nhighlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and\nsuggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong\nperformance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while\nfull model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.",

    "abstract": "As AI systems become more capable, deceptive behaviors can undermine\nevaluation and mislead users at deployment. Recent work has shown that lie\ndetectors can accurately classify deceptive behavior, but they are not\ntypically used in the training pipeline due to concerns around contamination\nand objective hacking. We examine these concerns by incorporating a lie\ndetector into the labelling step of LLM post-training and evaluating whether\nthe learned policy is genuinely more honest, or instead learns to fool the lie\ndetector while remaining deceptive. Using DolusChat, a novel 65k-example\ndataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses, we identify three key factors\nthat determine the honesty of learned policies: amount of exploration during\npreference learning, lie detector accuracy, and KL regularization strength. We\nfind that preference learning with lie detectors and GRPO can lead to policies\nwhich evade lie detectors, with deception rates of over 85\\%. However, if the\nlie detector true positive rate (TPR) or KL regularization is sufficiently\nhigh, GRPO learns honest policies. In contrast, off-policy algorithms (DPO)\nconsistently lead to deception rates under 25\\% for realistic TPRs. Our results\nillustrate a more complex picture than previously assumed: depending on the\ncontext, lie-detector-enhanced training can be a powerful tool for scalable\noversight, or a counterproductive method encouraging undetectable misalignment.",

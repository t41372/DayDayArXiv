    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), their\nperformance on complex reasoning problems requiring multi-step thinking and\ncombining various skills is still limited. To address this, we propose a novel\nframework HDFlow for complex reasoning with LLMs that combines fast and slow\nthinking modes in an adaptive manner. Our approach consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new approach for slow, deliberate reasoning called Dynamic\nWorkflow, which automatically decomposes complex problems into more manageable\nsub-tasks and dynamically designs a workflow to assemble specialized LLM or\nsymbolic reasoning tools to solve sub-tasks; 2) Hybrid Thinking, a general\nframework that dynamically combines fast and slow thinking based on problem\ncomplexity. Finally, we propose an easy-to-scale method for automatically\nsynthesizing a large-scale dataset of 27K challenging reasoning problems for\ncomplex reasoning and a hybrid thinking tuning method that trains smaller LLMs\non this dataset to internalize the fast/slow hybrid reasoning strategies.\nExperiments on four reasoning benchmark datasets demonstrate that our slow\nthinking with dynamic workflows significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thought, and\nhybrid thinking achieves the highest accuracy while providing an effective\nbalance between computational efficiency and performance. Fine-tuning using our\nhybrid thinking approach also significantly boosts the complex reasoning\ncapabilities of open-source language models. The results showcase the promise\nof slow thinking, dynamic workflows, and hybrid thinking in expanding the\nfrontier of complex problem-solving with LLMs\\footnote{Code and data will be\nreleased at \\url{https://github.com/wenlinyao/HDFlow}.}.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nhandling long context inputs, but this comes at the cost of increased\ncomputational resources and latency. Our research introduces a novel approach\nfor the long context bottleneck to accelerate LLM inference and reduce GPU\nmemory consumption. Our research demonstrates that LLMs can identify relevant\ntokens in the early layers before generating answers to a query. Leveraging\nthis insight, we propose an algorithm that uses early layers of an LLM as\nfilters to select and compress input tokens, significantly reducing the context\nlength for subsequent processing. Our method, GemFilter, demonstrates\nsubstantial improvements in both speed and memory efficiency compared to\nexisting techniques, such as standard attention and SnapKV/H2O. Notably, it\nachieves a 2.4$\\times$ speedup and 30\\% reduction in GPU memory usage compared\nto SOTA methods. Evaluation on the Needle in a Haystack task shows that\nGemFilter significantly outperforms standard attention, SnapKV and demonstrates\ncomparable performance on the LongBench challenge. GemFilter is simple,\ntraining-free, and broadly applicable across different LLMs. Crucially, it\nprovides interpretability by allowing humans to inspect the selected input\nsequence. These findings not only offer practical benefits for LLM deployment,\nbut also enhance our understanding of LLM internal mechanisms, paving the way\nfor further optimizations in LLM design and inference.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds\nconsiderable promise for transforming the battle against fake news. Generally,\nLLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. One major concern is that\nLLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a\nlarge scale. This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate\nbiased fake news? Do all LLMs have this capability? Conversely, LLMs offer\nvaluable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive\nknowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities. This leads to other\ncritical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform\ntypical detection models? In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal\nquestions by exploring the performance of various LLMs. Our objective is to\nexplore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news,\nmarking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models. Our\nresults reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols,\nrefusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily\nproduce fake news across a spectrum of biases. Additionally, our results show\nthat larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that\nLLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones.\nFinally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated\nexplanations in identifying fake news.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns the outputs of Large\nLanguage Models with human values and preferences. Central to this process is\nthe reward model (RM), which translates human feedback into training signals\nfor optimising LLM behaviour. However, RMs can develop biases by exploiting\nspurious correlations in their training data, such as favouring outputs based\non length or style rather than true quality. These biases can lead to incorrect\noutput rankings, sub-optimal model evaluations, and the amplification of\nundesirable behaviours in LLMs alignment. This paper addresses the challenge of\ncorrecting such biases without additional data and training, introducing the\nconcept of Post-hoc Reward Calibration. We first propose an intuitive approach\nto estimate the bias term and, thus, remove it to approximate the underlying\ntrue reward. We then extend the approach to a more general and robust form with\nthe Locally Weighted Regression. Focusing on the prevalent length bias, we\nvalidate our proposed approaches across three experimental settings,\ndemonstrating consistent improvements: (1) a 3.11 average performance gain\nacross 33 reward models on the RewardBench dataset; (2) enhanced alignment of\nRM rankings with GPT-4 evaluations and human preferences based on the\nAlpacaEval benchmark; and (3) improved Length-Controlled win rate of the RLHF\nprocess in multiple LLM--RM combinations. Our method is computationally\nefficient and generalisable to other types of bias and RMs, offering a scalable\nand robust solution for mitigating biases in LLM alignment.

Offline (that is, during cycle\nplanning and core design), a three dimensional neutronics simulator is used to\nestimate the reactor's power, moderator, void, and flow distributions, from\nwhich margin to thermal limits and fuel exposures can be approximated. Online,\nthis is accomplished with a system of local power range monitors (LPRMs)\ndesigned to capture enough neutron flux information to infer the full nodal\npower distribution.

Automated\nflower and fruit density estimation, localization, and counting could help\nstreamline harvesting, yield estimation, and crop-load management strategies\nsuch as flower and fruitlet thinning. This article proposes a deep\nregression-based network, AgRegNet, to estimate density, count, and location of\nflower and fruit in tree fruit canopies without explicit object detection or\npolygon annotation. Inspired by popular U-Net architecture, AgRegNet is a\nU-shaped network with an encoder-to-decoder skip connection and modified\nConvNeXt-T as an encoder feature extractor. AgRegNet can be trained based on\ninformation from point annotation and leverages segmentation information and\nattention modules (spatial and channel) to highlight relevant flower and fruit\nfeatures while suppressing non-relevant background features. Experimental\nevaluation in apple flower and fruit canopy images under an unstructured\norchard environment showed that AgRegNet achieved promising accuracy as\nmeasured by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), percentage Mean Absolute Error\n(pMAE) and mean Average Precision (mAP) to estimate flower and fruit density,\ncount, and centroid location, respectively.

This approach significantly\nreduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing\nprediction accuracy and even improving in high-density cases. We evaluate our\nproposed SSTP on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmarks using a wide range\nof recent state-of-the-art models. Our experiments demonstrate that SSTP\nachieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the\ndata while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes\nand significantly reducing training time. Importantly, SSTP exhibits strong\ngeneralization and robustness, and the selected subset is model-agnostic,\noffering a broadly applicable solution.",

Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning,\nquantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting\nmemory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy in\nLLMs. However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight\noptimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures. Besides,\ntraditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity\nwith extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs.\nIn this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to\nidentify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the\noriginal LLMs while achieving inference acceleration. Furthermore, after\ngenerating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we\nintroduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify\nthe inherited weights with a small amount of calibration data. Compared with\nSOTA training-free structured pruning works that can generate smaller networks,\nour method demonstrates superior performance across standard benchmarks.\nFurthermore, our generated subnets can directly reduce the usage of GPU memory\nand achieve inference acceleration.

    "abstract": "Despite transformers being considered as the new standard in computer vision,\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) still outperform them in low-data regimes.\nNonetheless, CNNs often make decisions based on narrow, specific regions of\ninput images, especially when training data is limited. This behavior can\nseverely compromise the model's generalization capabilities, making it\ndisproportionately dependent on certain features that might not represent the\nbroader context of images. While the conditions leading to this phenomenon\nremain elusive, the primary intent of this article is to shed light on this\nobserved behavior of neural networks. Our research endeavors to prioritize\ncomprehensive insight and to outline an initial response to this phenomenon. In\nline with this, we introduce Saliency Guided Dropout (SGDrop), a pioneering\nregularization approach tailored to address this specific issue. SGDrop\nutilizes attribution methods on the feature map to identify and then reduce the\ninfluence of the most salient features during training. This process encourages\nthe network to diversify its attention and not focus solely on specific\nstandout areas. Our experiments across several visual classification benchmarks\nvalidate SGDrop's role in enhancing generalization.

We introduce Minimal\nEmpirical Variance Aggregation (MEVA), a data-driven framework that integrates\npredictions from various models, enhancing overall accuracy by leveraging the\nindividual strengths of each. This non-intrusive, model-agnostic approach\ntreats the contributing models as black boxes and accommodates outputs from\ndiverse methodologies, including machine learning algorithms and traditional\nnumerical solvers. We advocate for a point-wise linear aggregation process and\nconsider two methods for optimizing this aggregate: Minimal Error Aggregation\n(MEA), which minimizes the prediction error, and Minimal Variance Aggregation\n(MVA), which focuses on reducing variance. We prove a theorem showing that MVA\ncan be more robustly estimated from data than MEA, making MEVA superior to\nMinimal Empirical Error Aggregation (MEEA). Unlike MEEA, which interpolates\ntarget values directly, MEVA formulates aggregation as an error estimation\nproblem, which can be performed using any backbone learning paradigm. We\ndemonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our framework across various\napplications, including data science and partial differential equations,\nillustrating its ability to significantly enhance both robustness and accuracy.",

Motivated by text prompting in LLMs, visual prompting\nhas been explored to enhance LVLMs' capabilities of perceiving visual\ninformation. However, previous visual prompting techniques solely process\nvisual inputs without considering text queries, limiting the models' ability to\nfollow text instructions to complete tasks. To fill this gap, in this work, we\npropose a new prompting technique named Attention Prompting on Image, which\njust simply overlays a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original\ninput image and effectively enhances LVLM on various tasks. Specifically, we\ngenerate an attention heatmap for the input image dependent on the text query\nwith an auxiliary model like CLIP. Then the heatmap simply multiplies the pixel\nvalues of the original image to obtain the actual input image for the LVLM.\nExtensive experiments on various vison-language benchmarks verify the\neffectiveness of our technique.

In this paper, we provide an in-depth\nanalysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to\nanswer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with\nneural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based\nsystems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are\nhighly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system\nusing Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with\nhuge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip -\na novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online\nmemorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely.\nFineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5\ndays, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip\noutperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin,\nimproving compression ratios by approximately 50\\%. With this work, we take the\nfirst step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While\nFineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a\nviable solution for large-scale text compression.

    "abstract": "Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts\nto craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous\nrules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address\nthe unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile,\napplying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B\nparameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to\nthose of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel\nframework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to\nrefine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as\nstring normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental\nresults show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either\noriginal data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2%\nacross various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model\nsizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb,\nFineWeb-Edu, and DCLM. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in\ndomain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models\ntrained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based\nmethods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for\nLlama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable\nto models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights\nthat ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for\nefficient LLM pre-training.

These automatically learn rich\nrepresentations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, the\nlearned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection,\nvalidation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible\nto associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but\nextractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step\ntowards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a\nmethod that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for\na given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept\nembeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical\nclustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector\ndistances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in\navailable ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningful\nontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundation\nmodels. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learned\nrepresentations against given ontologies. Lastly, we discuss potential future\napplications in the context of QR.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies have investigated low-precision accumulation,\nreporting improvements in throughput, power, and area across various platforms.\nHowever, the accompanying proposals have only considered the quantization-aware\ntraining (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch\nwith quantization in the loop. As models continue to grow in size, QAT\ntechniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent\nsurge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To the best of our\nknowledge, ours marks the first formal study of accumulator-aware quantization\nin the PTQ setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, a practical framework\nof accumulator-aware extensions designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees\nto existing layer-wise PTQ algorithms. We theoretically motivate AXE and\ndemonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two state-of-the-art\nPTQ algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We further generalize AXE to support multi-stage\naccumulation for the first time, opening the door for full datapath\noptimization and scaling to large language models (LLMs). We evaluate AXE\nacross image classification and language generation models, and observe\nsignificant improvements in the trade-off between accumulator bit width and\nmodel accuracy over baseline methods.",

Nevertheless, existing works lack sufficient semantic and\nsequential steerability for challenging video/3D sequence generation, and\nneglect quality control of noisy synthesized samples, resulting in unreliable\nsynthetic databases and severely limiting the performance of downstream tasks.\nIn this work, we present Ctrl-GenAug, a novel and general generative\naugmentation framework that enables highly semantic- and sequential-customized\nsequence synthesis and suppresses incorrectly synthesized samples, to aid\nmedical sequence classification. Specifically, we first design a multimodal\nconditions-guided sequence generator for controllably synthesizing\ndiagnosis-promotive samples. A sequential augmentation module is integrated to\nenhance the temporal/stereoscopic coherence of generated samples. Then, we\npropose a noisy synthetic data filter to suppress unreliable cases at semantic\nand sequential levels.

    "abstract": "Scaling model size significantly challenges the deployment and inference of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent\nresearch has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit\n(even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs,\nand decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to\nnumerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight\nquantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit. Recent research on\nVector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely\nlow-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup\ntables.\n  In this paper, we introduce Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ) for\nextremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to\nformulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by\nsolving the optimization. We further refine the weights using\nChannel-Independent Second-Order Optimization for a granular VQ. In addition,\nby decomposing the optimization problem, we propose a brief and effective\ncodebook initialization algorithm. We also extend VPTQ to support residual and\noutlier quantization, which enhances model accuracy and further compresses the\nmodel. Our experimental results show that VPTQ reduces model quantization\nperplexity by $0.01$-$0.34$ on LLaMA-2, $0.38$-$0.68$ on Mistral-7B,\n$4.41$-$7.34$ on LLaMA-3 over SOTA at 2-bit, with an average accuracy\nimprovement of $0.79$-$1.5\\%$ on LLaMA-2, $1\\%$ on Mistral-7B, $11$-$22\\%$ on\nLLaMA-3 on QA tasks on average. We only utilize $10.4$-$18.6\\%$ of the\nquantization algorithm execution time, resulting in a $1.6$-$1.8\\times$\nincrease in inference throughput compared to SOTA.",

The use of diverse modalities, including histopathology slides,\nMRI, and genetic data, offers unprecedented opportunities to improve prognosis\nprediction and to unveil new treatment pathways. Contrastive learning, widely\nused for deriving representations from paired data in multimodal tasks, assumes\nthat different views contain the same task-relevant information and leverages\nonly shared information. This assumption becomes restrictive when handling\nmedical data since each modality also harbors specific knowledge relevant to\ndownstream tasks. We introduce DRIM, a new multimodal method for capturing\nthese shared and unique representations, despite data sparsity. More\nspecifically, given a set of modalities, we aim to encode a representation for\neach one that can be divided into two components: one encapsulating\npatient-related information common across modalities and the other,\nencapsulating modality-specific details. This is achieved by increasing the\nshared information among different patient modalities while minimizing the\noverlap between shared and unique components within each modality.

    "abstract": "One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the\ntime-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct\nthorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition,\nproviding treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical\nrecords. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to\nask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is\nessential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to\nimprove time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early\ndiagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized\nlarge language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize\ndoctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription\nand GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This\nsystem is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension,\nallowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this\nsolution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors\ncan improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of\nrecords, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This\ninnovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the\nadministrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia.

Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as\nan output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason\nabout counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In\nthis work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we\ndevelop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max\nstructural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform\ncounterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla\ntoken generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not\nrequire any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama\n3 8B-Instruct and Ministral-8B-Instruct and conduct a qualitative and a\nquantitative analysis of counterfactually generated text. We conclude with a\ndemonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for bias\ndetection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world\nconstructed by large language models.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) represents a significant\nthreat to space sustainability and spacecraft safety. Active Debris Removal\n(ADR) has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue, utilising\nOrbital Transfer Vehicles (OTVs) to facilitate debris deorbiting, thereby\nreducing future collision risks. However, ADR missions are substantially\ncomplex, necessitating accurate planning to make the missions economically\nviable and technically effective. Moreover, these servicing missions require a\nhigh level of autonomous capability to plan under evolving orbital conditions\nand changing mission requirements. In this paper, an autonomous\ndecision-planning model based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is developed\nto train an OTV to plan optimal debris removal sequencing. It is shown that\nusing the proposed framework, the agent can find optimal mission plans and\nlearn to update the planning autonomously to include risk handling of debris\nwith high collision risk.",

    "abstract": "Data selection is of great significance in pre-training large language\nmodels, given the variation in quality within the large-scale available\ntraining corpora. To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the\nuse of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a\nhigh influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training\nset is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the\ntop-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several\nlimitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data is\ntime-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which\nmay hinder the pre-trained model's ability to generalize effectively to various\ndownstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{Quad}, a data selection\napproach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence to\nachieve state-of-the-art pre-training results. In particular, noting that\nattention layers capture extensive semantic details, we have adapted the\naccelerated $iHVP$ computation methods for attention layers, enhancing our\nability to evaluate the influence of data, $i.e.,$ its quality. For the\ndiversity, \\texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instances\nwithin each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each\ncluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the\ninfluence to prevent processing all instances. To determine which clusters to\nselect, we utilize the classic Multi-Armed Bandit method, treating each cluster\nas an arm. This approach favors clusters with highly influential instances\n(ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently\n(ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity.",

Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a\nweak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural\nLanguage Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to\nimplement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain\ngeneralization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics\nusing LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they\nstill lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits\ntheir generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency\nEvaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers\nexplanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and\npinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which\ncan be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperforms\nboth non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detecting\ninconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, and\ndata-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%.

    "abstract": "Generating and inserting new objects into 3D content is a compelling approach\nfor achieving versatile scene recreation. Existing methods, which rely on SDS\noptimization or single-view inpainting, often struggle to produce high-quality\nresults. To address this, we propose a novel method for object insertion in 3D\ncontent represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces a multi-view\ndiffusion model, dubbed MVInpainter, which is built upon a pre-trained stable\nvideo diffusion model to facilitate view-consistent object inpainting. Within\nMVInpainter, we incorporate a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to\nenable controlled and more predictable multi-view generation. After generating\nthe multi-view inpainted results, we further propose a mask-aware 3D\nreconstruction technique to refine Gaussian Splatting reconstruction from these\nsparse inpainted views. By leveraging these fabricate techniques, our approach\nyields diverse results, ensures view-consistent and harmonious insertions, and\nproduces better object quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms existing methods.",

In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised\nLearning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method\nthat leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most\nconfident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled\ndata are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated\nfrom embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large\nlanguage models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition\ntranscriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific\nknowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both\nsources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal\nclassifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a\npredefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion\nrecognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised\nlearning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two\nselected baselines.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering aims to study the complementary information across\nviews and discover the underlying structure. For solving the relatively high\ncomputational cost for the existing approaches, works based on anchor have been\npresented recently. Even with acceptable clustering performance, these methods\ntend to map the original representation from multiple views into a fixed shared\ngraph based on the original dataset. However, most studies ignore the\ndiscriminative property of the learned anchors, which ruin the representation\ncapability of the built model. Moreover, the complementary information among\nanchors across views is neglected to be ensured by simply learning the shared\nanchor graph without considering the quality of view-specific anchors. In this\npaper, we propose discriminative anchor learning for multi-view clustering\n(DALMC) for handling the above issues. We learn discriminative view-specific\nfeature representations according to the original dataset and build anchors\nfrom different views based on these representations, which increase the quality\nof the shared anchor graph. The discriminative feature learning and consensus\nanchor graph construction are integrated into a unified framework to improve\neach other for realizing the refinement. The optimal anchors from multiple\nviews and the consensus anchor graph are learned with the orthogonal\nconstraints. We give an iterative algorithm to deal with the formulated\nproblem.

To address this challenge, we propose an AIdriven view\nguidance system that operates in a continuous closed-loop with\nhuman-in-the-loop feedback, designed to assist users in navigating ICE imaging\nwithout requiring specialized knowledge.

By operating in a closedloop configuration, the system\ncontinuously predicts and updates the necessary catheter manipulations,\nensuring seamless integration into existing clinical workflows. The\neffectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through a simulation-based\nperformance evaluation using real clinical data, achieving an 89% success rate\nwith 6,532 test cases.

However, current modeling approaches remain\nlabor-intensive and prone to human errors due to their dependence on manual\nworkflows. These processes typically involve extensive literature reviews,\nformula tuning, and iterative testing, which often lead to inefficiencies. To\naddress this, we propose TR-Agent, an AI-powered framework that autonomously\ndevelops and refines traffic models through a closed-loop, iterative process.\nWe structure the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation,\ntheory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization, and\nimplement TR-Agent with four corresponding modules. These modules collaborate\nto retrieve knowledge from external sources, generate novel hypotheses,\nimplement and debug models, and evaluate their performance on evaluation\ndatasets. Through iteratively feedback and refinement, TR-Agent improves both\nmodeling efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the framework on three\nrepresentative traffic models: the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for\ncar-following behavior, the MOBIL model for lane-changing, and the\nLighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) speed-density relationship for macroscopic\ntraffic flow modeling. Experimental results show substantial performance gains\nover the original models. To assess the robustness and generalizability of the\nimprovements, we conduct additional evaluations across multiple real-world\ndatasets, demonstrating consistent performance gains beyond the original\ndevelopment data. Furthermore, TR-Agent produces interpretable explanations for\neach improvement, enabling researchers to easily verify and extend its results.\nThis makes TR-Agent a valuable assistant for traffic modeling refinement and a\npromising tool for broader applications in transportation research.",

    "abstract": "Heuristics are commonly used to tackle various search and optimization\nproblems. Design heuristics usually require tedious manual crafting with domain\nknowledge. Recent works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) into\nautomatic heuristic search, leveraging their powerful language and coding\ncapacity. However, existing research focuses on the optimal performance on the\ntarget problem as the sole objective, neglecting other criteria such as\nefficiency and scalability, which are vital in practice. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose to model the heuristic search as a multi-objective\noptimization problem and consider introducing additional practical criteria\nbeyond optimal performance. Due to the complexity of the search space,\nconventional multi-objective optimization methods struggle to effectively\nhandle LLM-based multi-objective heuristic search. We propose the first\nLLM-based multi-objective heuristic search framework, Multi-objective Evolution\nof Heuristic (MEoH), which integrates LLMs in a zero-shot manner to generate a\nnon-dominated set of heuristics to meet multiple design criteria. We design a\nnew dominance-dissimilarity mechanism for effective population management and\nselection, which incorporates both code dissimilarity in the search space and\ndominance in the objective space. MEoH is demonstrated in two well-known\ncombinatorial optimization problems: the online Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and\nthe Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The results indicate that a variety of\nelite heuristics are automatically generated in a single run, offering more\ntrade-off options than the existing methods. It successfully achieves\ncompetitive or superior performance while improving efficiency up to 10 times.\nMoreover, we also observe that the multi-objective search introduces novel\ninsights into heuristic design and leads to the discovery of diverse\nheuristics.",

    "abstract": "Training a diverse ensemble of models has several practical applications such\nas providing candidates for model selection with better out-of-distribution\n(OOD) generalization, and enabling the detection of OOD samples via Bayesian\nprinciples. An existing approach to diverse ensemble training encourages the\nmodels to disagree on provided OOD samples. However, the approach is\ncomputationally expensive and it requires well-separated ID and OOD examples,\nsuch that it has only been demonstrated in small-scale settings.\n  $\\textbf{Method.}$ This work presents a method for Scalable Ensemble\nDiversification (SED) applicable to large-scale settings (e.g. ImageNet) that\ndoes not require OOD samples. Instead, SED identifies hard training samples on\nthe fly and encourages the ensemble members to disagree on these. To improve\nscaling, we show how to avoid the expensive computations in existing methods of\nexhaustive pairwise disagreements across models.\n  $\\textbf{Results.}$ We evaluate the benefits of diversification with\nexperiments on ImageNet. First, for OOD generalization, we observe large\nbenefits from the diversification in multiple settings including output-space\n(classical) ensembles and weight-space ensembles (model soups). Second, for OOD\ndetection, we turn the diversity of ensemble hypotheses into a novel\nuncertainty score estimator that surpasses a large number of OOD detection\nbaselines.\n  Code is available here:\nhttps://github.com/AlexanderRubinstein/diverse-universe-public.",

    "abstract": "Tabular reinforcement learning methods cannot operate directly on continuous\nstate spaces. One solution for this problem is to partition the state space. A\ngood partitioning enables generalization during learning and more efficient\nexploitation of prior experiences. Consequently, the learning process becomes\nfaster and produces more reliable policies. However, partitioning introduces\napproximation, which is particularly harmful in the presence of nonlinear\nrelations between state components. An ideal partition should be as coarse as\npossible, while capturing the key structure of the state space for the given\nproblem. This work extracts partitions from the environment dynamics by\nsymbolic execution. We show that symbolic partitioning improves state space\ncoverage with respect to environmental behavior and allows reinforcement\nlearning to perform better for sparse rewards. We evaluate symbolic state space\npartitioning with respect to precision, scalability, learning agent performance\nand state space coverage for the learnt policies.",

Human\ndesigners experiment with the placement and modification of elements to create\naesthetic layouts, however, we observed that current discrete diffusion models\n(DDMs) struggle to correct inharmonious layouts after they have been generated.\nIn this paper, we first provide novel insights into layout sticking phenomenon\nin DDMs and then propose a simple yet effective layout-assessment module\nLayout-Corrector, which works in conjunction with existing DDMs to address the\nlayout sticking problem. We present a learning-based module capable of\nidentifying inharmonious elements within layouts, considering overall layout\nharmony characterized by complex composition. During the generation process,\nLayout-Corrector evaluates the correctness of each token in the generated\nlayout, reinitializing those with low scores to the ungenerated state. The DDM\nthen uses the high-scored tokens as clues to regenerate the harmonized tokens.\nLayout-Corrector, tested on common benchmarks, consistently boosts\nlayout-generation performance when in conjunction with various state-of-the-art\nDDMs. Furthermore, our extensive analysis demonstrates that the\nLayout-Corrector (1) successfully identifies erroneous tokens, (2) facilitates\ncontrol over the fidelity-diversity trade-off, and (3) significantly mitigates\nthe performance drop associated with fast sampling.",

However,\nexisting graph unlearning techniques often necessitate additional training on\nthe remaining data, leading to significant computational costs, particularly\nwith large-scale graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage\ntraining-free approach, Erase then Rectify (ETR), designed for efficient and\nscalable graph unlearning while preserving the model utility.

To\nfurther ensure the GNN's utility, the Rectify stage devises a gradient\napproximation method to estimate the model's gradient on the remaining dataset,\nwhich is then used to enhance model performance. Overall, ETR achieves graph\nunlearning without additional training or full training data access,\nsignificantly reducing computational overhead and preserving data privacy.\nExtensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate the consistent\nsuperiority of ETR in model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning\neffectiveness, establishing it as a promising solution for real-world graph\nunlearning challenges.",

    "abstract": "A global threshold (e.g., 0.5) is often applied to determine which bounding\nboxes should be included in the final results for an object detection task. A\nhigher threshold reduces false positives but may result in missing a\nsignificant portion of true positives. A lower threshold can increase detection\nrecall but may also result in more false positives. Because of this, using a\npreset global threshold (e.g., 0.5) applied to all the bounding box candidates\nmay lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a Test-time\nSelf-guided Bounding-box Propagation (TSBP) method, leveraging Earth Mover's\nDistance (EMD) to enhance object detection in histology images. TSBP utilizes\nbounding boxes with high confidence to influence those with low confidence,\nleveraging visual similarities between them.

How to effectively adopt a\nwell-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural\ndistributions remains an under-explored problem.

However, learning robust object\nrepresentations for UAV tracking is especially challenging in complex dynamic\nenvironments, when confronted with aspect ratio change and occlusion. These\nchallenges severely alter the original information of the object. To handle the\nabove issues, this work proposes a novel progressive representation learning\nframework for UAV tracking, i.e., PRL-Track. Specifically, PRL-Track is divided\ninto coarse representation learning and fine representation learning. For\ncoarse representation learning, two innovative regulators, which rely on\nappearance and semantic information, are designed to mitigate appearance\ninterference and capture semantic information. Furthermore, for fine\nrepresentation learning, a new hierarchical modeling generator is developed to\nintertwine coarse object representations. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed PRL-Track delivers exceptional performance on three\nauthoritative UAV tracking benchmarks. Real-world tests indicate that the\nproposed PRL-Track realizes superior tracking performance with 42.6 frames per\nsecond on the typical UAV platform equipped with an edge smart camera.

The key to\naccurately predicting information popularity lies in subtly modeling the\nunderlying temporal information diffusion process behind observed events of an\ninformation cascade, such as the retweets of a tweet. To this end, most\nexisting methods either adopt recurrent networks to capture the temporal\ndynamics from the first to the last observed event or develop a statistical\nmodel based on self-exciting point processes to make predictions. However,\ninformation diffusion is intrinsically a complex continuous-time process with\nirregularly observed discrete events, which is oversimplified using recurrent\nnetworks as they fail to capture the irregular time intervals between events,\nor using self-exciting point processes as they lack flexibility to capture the\ncomplex diffusion process. Against this background, we propose ConCat, modeling\nthe Continuous-time dynamics of Cascades for information popularity prediction.\nOn the one hand, it leverages neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to\nmodel irregular events of a cascade in continuous time based on the cascade\ngraph and sequential event information. On the other hand, it considers cascade\nevents as neural temporal point processes (TPPs) parameterized by a conditional\nintensity function which can also benefit the popularity prediction task. We\nconduct extensive experiments to evaluate ConCat on three real-world datasets.\nResults show that ConCat achieves superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines, yielding a 2.3%-33.2% improvement over the\nbest-performing baselines across the three datasets.",

    "abstract": "While many online services provide privacy policies for end users to read and\nunderstand what personal data are being collected, these documents are often\nlengthy and complicated. As a result, the vast majority of users do not read\nthem at all, leading to data collection under uninformed consent. Several\nattempts have been made to make privacy policies more user friendly by\nsummarising them, providing automatic annotations or labels for key sections,\nor by offering chat interfaces to ask specific questions. With recent advances\nin Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an opportunity to develop more\neffective tools to parse privacy policies and help users make informed\ndecisions. In this paper, we propose an entailment-driven LLM based framework\nto classify paragraphs of privacy policies into meaningful labels that are\neasily understood by users. The results demonstrate that our framework\noutperforms traditional LLM methods, improving the F1 score in average by\n11.2%. Additionally, our framework provides inherently explainable and\nmeaningful predictions.",

SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train\nML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data\nprivacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied,\nthe problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients\nlack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between\nclient and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server\nside. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL),\nan application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train\nmodels with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. In\naddition, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for\ndesigning a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and\ncircuit depth. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and\nability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models.\nNotably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and\nF1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the\nSpeech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients,\nconfirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense\nmechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel JSCC architecture, named MambaJSCC, that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with low computational and parameter overhead.\nMambaJSCC utilizes the visual state space model with channel adaptation\n(VSSM-CA) blocks as its backbone for transmitting images over wireless\nchannels, where the VSSM-CA primarily consists of the generalized state space\nmodels (GSSM) and the zero-parameter, zero-computational channel adaptation\nmethod (CSI-ReST).

We discover that GSSM inherently possesses the ability to adapt to\nchannels, a form of endogenous intelligence. Based on this, we design the\nCSI-ReST method, which injects channel state information (CSI) into the initial\nstate of GSSM to utilize its native response, and into the residual state to\nmitigate CSI forgetting, enabling effective channel adaptation without\nintroducing additional computational and parameter overhead.

    "abstract": "This report outlines our approach for the WMT24 Discourse-Level Literary\nTranslation Task, focusing on the Chinese-English language pair in the\nConstrained Track. Translating literary texts poses significant challenges due\nto the nuanced meanings, idiomatic expressions, and intricate narrative\nstructures inherent in such works. To address these challenges, we leveraged\nthe Chinese-Llama2 model, specifically enhanced for this task through a\ncombination of Continual Pre-training (CPT) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).\nOur methodology includes a novel Incremental Decoding framework, which ensures\nthat each sentence is translated with consideration of its broader context,\nmaintaining coherence and consistency throughout the text. This approach allows\nthe model to capture long-range dependencies and stylistic elements, producing\ntranslations that faithfully preserve the original literary quality. Our\nexperiments demonstrate significant improvements in both sentence-level and\ndocument-level BLEU scores, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed\nframework in addressing the complexities of document-level literary\ntranslation.",

    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging problem in object\ndetection, where a pre-trained source model is adapted to a new target domain\nwithout using any source domain data for privacy and efficiency reasons. Most\nstate-of-the-art SFDA methods for object detection have been proposed for\nFaster-RCNN, a detector that is known to have high computational complexity.\nThis paper focuses on domain adaptation techniques for real-world vision\nsystems, particularly for the YOLO family of single-shot detectors known for\ntheir fast baselines and practical applications. Our proposed SFDA method -\nSource-Free YOLO (SF-YOLO) - relies on a teacher-student framework in which the\nstudent receives images with a learned, target domain-specific augmentation,\nallowing the model to be trained with only unlabeled target data and without\nrequiring feature alignment. A challenge with self-training using a\nmean-teacher architecture in the absence of labels is the rapid decline of\naccuracy due to noisy or drifting pseudo-labels. To address this issue, a\nteacher-to-student communication mechanism is introduced to help stabilize the\ntraining and reduce the reliance on annotated target data for model selection.\nDespite its simplicity, our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art\ndetectors on several challenging benchmark datasets, even sometimes\noutperforming methods that use source data for adaptation.",

    "abstract": "With the process of urbanization and the rapid growth of population, the\nissue of traffic congestion has become an increasingly critical concern.\nIntelligent transportation systems heavily rely on real-time and precise\nprediction algorithms to address this problem. While Recurrent Neural Network\n(RNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in deep learning have\ndemonstrated high accuracy in predicting road conditions when sufficient data\nis available, forecasting in road networks with limited data remains a\nchallenging task. This study proposed a novel Spatial-temporal Convolutional\nNetwork (TL-GPSTGN) based on graph pruning and transfer learning framework to\ntackle this issue. Firstly, the essential structure and information of the\ngraph are extracted by analyzing the correlation and information entropy of the\nroad network structure and feature data. By utilizing graph pruning techniques,\nthe adjacency matrix of the graph and the input feature data are processed,\nresulting in a significant improvement in the model's migration performance.\nSubsequently, the well-characterized data are inputted into the\nspatial-temporal graph convolutional network to capture the spatial-temporal\nrelationships and make predictions regarding the road conditions. Furthermore,\nthis study conducts comprehensive testing and validation of the TL-GPSTGN\nmethod on real datasets, comparing its prediction performance against other\ncommonly used models under identical conditions. The results demonstrate the\nexceptional predictive accuracy of TL-GPSTGN on a single dataset, as well as\nits robust migration performance across different datasets.",

    "abstract": "Blind people are often called to contribute image data to datasets for AI\ninnovation with the hope for future accessibility and inclusion. Yet, the\nvisual inspection of the contributed images is inaccessible. To this day, we\nlack mechanisms for data inspection and control that are accessible to the\nblind community. To address this gap, we engage 10 blind participants in a\nscenario where they wear smartglasses and collect image data using an\nAI-infused application in their homes. We also engineer a design probe, a novel\ndata access interface called AccessShare, and conduct a co-design study to\ndiscuss participants' needs, preferences, and ideas on consent, data\ninspection, and control. Our findings reveal the impact of interactive informed\nconsent and the complementary role of data inspection systems such as\nAccessShare in facilitating communication between data stewards and blind data\ncontributors. We discuss how key insights can guide future informed consent and\ndata control to promote inclusive and responsible data practices in AI.",

The proposed approach leverages semantic and pragmatic\naspects, incorporating recent advances on large language models (LLMs) to\nachieve compact representations of knowledge to be processed and exchanged\nbetween intelligent agents. This is accomplished by using the cascade of LLMs\nand graph neural networks (GNNs) as semantic encoders, where information to be\nshared is selected to be meaningful at the receiver. The embedding vectors\nproduced by the proposed semantic encoder represent information in the form of\ntriplets: nodes (semantic concepts entities), edges(relations between\nconcepts), nodes. Thus, semantic information is associated with the\nrepresentation of relationships among elements in the space of semantic concept\nabstractions. In this paper, we investigate the potential of achieving high\ncompression rates in communication by incorporating relations that link\nelements within graph embeddings. We propose sending semantic symbols solely\nequivalent to node embeddings through the wireless channel and inferring the\ncomplete knowledge graph at the receiver.

However, the long-tailed problem has adversely affected the\nscene graph's quality. The predictions are dominated by coarse-grained\nrelationships, lacking more informative fine-grained ones. The union region of\none object pair (i.e., one sample) contains rich and dedicated contextual\ninformation, enabling the prediction of the sample-specific bias for refining\nthe original relationship prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel\nSample-Level Bias Prediction (SBP) method for fine-grained SGG (SBG). Firstly,\nwe train a classic SGG model and construct a correction bias set by calculating\nthe margin between the ground truth label and the predicted label with one\nclassic SGG model. Then, we devise a Bias-Oriented Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (BGAN) that learns to predict the constructed correction biases, which\ncan be utilized to correct the original predictions from coarse-grained\nrelationships to fine-grained ones.

This scoping review aims to provide a\npanoramic portrait of the application of LLMs in CCM. Literature in seven\ndatabases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, IEEE\nXplore, and ACM Digital Library, were searched from January 1, 2019, to June\n10, 2024. Peer-reviewed journal and conference articles that discussed the\napplication of LLMs in critical care settings were included. From an initial\n619 articles, 24 were selected for final review. This review grouped\napplications of LLMs in CCM into three categories: clinical decision support,\nmedical documentation and reporting, and medical education and doctor-patient\ncommunication. LLMs have advantages in handling unstructured data and do not\nrequire manual feature engineering. Meanwhile, applying LLMs to CCM faces\nchallenges, including hallucinations, poor interpretability, bias and alignment\nchallenges, and privacy and ethics issues. Future research should enhance model\nreliability and interpretability, integrate up-to-date medical knowledge, and\nstrengthen privacy and ethical guidelines.

    "abstract": "In underwater image enhancement (UIE), convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nhave inherent limitations in modeling long-range dependencies and are less\neffective in recovering global features. While Transformers excel at modeling\nlong-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity with\nincreasing image resolution presents significant efficiency challenges.\nAdditionally, most supervised learning methods lack effective physical model\nconstraint, which can lead to insufficient realism and overfitting in generated\nimages. To address these issues, we propose a physical model constraint-based\nunderwater image enhancement framework, Mamba-UIE. Specifically, we decompose\nthe input image into four components: underwater scene radiance, direct\ntransmission map, backscatter transmission map, and global background light.\nThese components are reassembled according to the revised underwater image\nformation model, and the reconstruction consistency constraint is applied\nbetween the reconstructed image and the original image, thereby achieving\neffective physical constraint on the underwater image enhancement process. To\ntackle the quadratic computational complexity of Transformers when handling\nlong sequences, we introduce the Mamba-UIE network based on linear complexity\nstate space models. By incorporating the Mamba in Convolution block, long-range\ndependencies are modeled at both the channel and spatial levels, while the CNN\nbackbone is retained to recover local features and details. Extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed Mamba-UIE\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PSNR of 27.13 and an\nSSIM of 0.93 on the UIEB dataset. Our method is available at\nhttps://github.com/zhangsong1213/Mamba-UIE.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of CLIP image embeddings within the Stable\nVideo Diffusion (SVD) framework, focusing on their impact on video generation\nquality and computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that CLIP\nembeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly\ncontribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs.\nMoreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be\neffectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only\nonce at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and\nreused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while\nmaintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the\nVCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD\narchitecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial\ncross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing\ncomputational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to\n322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model\nparameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the\nbaseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic\nBinding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation\nacross all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video\ngeneration.",

However, current physical backdoor\nattacks require poisoned inputs to have incorrect labels, making them easily\ndetectable by human inspection. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of\nattacks, \\textbf{clean-label physical backdoor attacks (CLPBA)}, via\nexperiments on facial recognition and animal classification tasks. Our study\nreveals that CLPBA could be a serious threat with the right poisoning algorithm\nand physical trigger. A key finding is that different from digital backdoor\nattacks which exploit memorization to plant backdoors in deep nets, CLPBA works\nby embedding the feature of the trigger distribution (i.e., the distribution of\ntrigger samples) to the poisoned images through the perturbations. We also find\nthat representative defenses cannot defend against CLPBA easily since CLPBA\nfundamentally breaks the core assumptions behind these defenses. Our study\nhighlights accidental backdoor activations as a limitation of CLPBA, happening\nwhen unintended objects or classes cause the model to misclassify as the target\nclass.

To reduce the negative impact, timely\nidentification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has\nbecome an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex\nphenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In\nthis paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation\nand real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles\nand form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity\ndiscrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a\nset of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the\nexisting psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of\narticles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder\nstructure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the\ntoken features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon\nthese ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by\nIntegrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER).

    "abstract": "Random forests are considered a cornerstone in machine learning for their\nrobustness and versatility. Despite these strengths, their conventional\ncentralized training is ill-suited for the modern landscape of data that is\noften distributed, sensitive, and subject to privacy concerns. Federated\nlearning (FL) provides a compelling solution to this problem, enabling models\nto be trained across a group of clients while maintaining the privacy of each\nclient's data. However, adapting tree-based methods like random forests to\nfederated settings introduces significant challenges, particularly when it\ncomes to non-identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients, which is a\ncommon scenario in real-world applications. This paper presents a federated\nrandom forest approach that employs a novel ensemble construction method aimed\nat improving performance under non-IID data. Instead of growing trees\nindependently in each client, our approach ensures each decision tree in the\nensemble is iteratively and collectively grown across clients. To preserve the\nprivacy of the client's data, we confine the information stored in the leaf\nnodes to the majority class label identified from the samples of the client's\nlocal data that reach each node. This limited disclosure preserves the\nconfidentiality of the underlying data distribution of clients, thereby\nenhancing the privacy of the federated learning process. Furthermore, our\ncollaborative ensemble construction strategy allows the ensemble to better\nreflect the data's heterogeneity across different clients, enhancing its\nperformance on non-IID data, as our experimental results confirm.",

    "abstract": "One fundamental task for NLP is to determine the similarity between two texts\nand evaluate the extent of their likeness. The previous methods for the Persian\nlanguage have low accuracy and are unable to comprehend the structure and\nmeaning of texts effectively. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on\nformal texts, but in real-world applications of text processing, there is a\nneed for robust methods that can handle colloquial texts. This requires\nalgorithms that consider the structure and significance of words based on\ncontext, rather than just the frequency of words. The lack of a proper dataset\nfor this task in the Persian language makes it important to develop such\nalgorithms and construct a dataset for Persian text. This paper introduces a\nnew transformer-based model to measure semantic similarity between Persian\ninformal short texts from social networks. In addition, a Persian dataset named\nFarSSiM has been constructed for this purpose, using real data from social\nnetworks and manually annotated and verified by a linguistic expert team. The\nproposed model involves training a large language model using the BERT\narchitecture from scratch. This model, called FarSSiBERT, is pre-trained on\napproximately 104 million Persian informal short texts from social networks,\nmaking it one of a kind in the Persian language. Moreover, a novel specialized\ninformal language tokenizer is provided that not only performs tokenization on\nformal texts well but also accurately identifies tokens that other Persian\ntokenizers are unable to recognize. It has been demonstrated that our proposed\nmodel outperforms ParsBERT, laBSE, and multilingual BERT in the Pearson and\nSpearman's coefficient criteria. Additionally, the pre-trained large language\nmodel has great potential for use in other NLP tasks on colloquial text and as\na tokenizer for less-known informal words.",

    "abstract": "Natural physical, chemical, and biological dynamical systems are often\ncomplex, with heterogeneous components interacting in diverse ways. We show\nthat graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction\nrules and the structure of the heterogeneity from data alone. The learned\nlatent structure and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex\nsystem which is necessary to parameterize and infer the underlying governing\nequations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of moving\nparticles and vector fields that interact with each other. While our current\naim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we\nanticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing\nrules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning practitioners often avoid hierarchical policies,\nespecially in image-based observation spaces. Typically, the single-task\nperformance improvement over flat-policy counterparts does not justify the\nadditional complexity associated with implementing a hierarchy. However, by\nintroducing multiple decision-making levels, hierarchical policies can compose\nlower-level policies to more effectively generalize between tasks, highlighting\nthe need for multi-task evaluations. We analyze the benefits of hierarchy\nthrough simulated multi-task robotic control experiments from pixels. Our\nresults show that hierarchical policies trained with task conditioning can (1)\nincrease performance on training tasks, (2) lead to improved reward and\nstate-space generalizations in similar tasks, and (3) decrease the complexity\nof fine tuning required to solve novel tasks. Thus, we believe that\nhierarchical policies should be considered when building reinforcement learning\narchitectures capable of generalizing between tasks.",

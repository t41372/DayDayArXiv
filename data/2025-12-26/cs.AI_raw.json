The platform employs a heterogeneous computing architecture, with RPi 5 and ROS 2 handling AI-based perception and path planning, while ESP32 running FreeRTOS ensures real-time motor control. The mechanical design was optimized for payload capacity and mobility through precise motor selection and material engineering. Key technical challenges addressed include optimizing computationally intensive AI algorithms on a resource-constrained platform and implementing a low-latency, reliable communication link between the ROS 2 host and embedded controller. Results demonstrate deterministic, PID-based motor control through rigorous memory and task management, and enhanced system reliability via AWS IoT monitoring and a firmware-level motor shutdown failsafe. This work highlights a unified, multi-disciplinary methodology, resulting in a robust and operational autonomous delivery system capable of real-world deployment.",

We evaluate four models, Llama-3 (90B), Gemma-3 (27B), Qwen-3 (235B), and DeepSeek-R1 (685B) across eight public benchmark datasets, with five inference strategies, and two routing variants encompassing 31,019 prompts and 163,720 inference runs. Pick and Spin achieves up to 21.6% higher success rates, 30% lower latency, and 33% lower GPU cost per query compared with static deployments of the same models.",

It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms.

The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.",

Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and k-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.",

Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $μ$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.",

This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead.

Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.",

In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.",

We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across 180 query executions on Google BigQuery using the StackOverflow dataset (230GB), measuring bytes processed, slot utilization, and estimated cost. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query.

This article develops a framework for navigating between these approaches. We show that the choice between deduction and induction reflects a tradeoff between interpretability and flexibility, and we demonstrate through simulation when each approach excels. Our framework is particularly relevant for inequality research, where understanding how treatment effects vary across intersecting social subpopulation is substantively central.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io",

    "abstract": "Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.\n  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.",

Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.",

Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training. When applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models, we find that this recipe preserves general knowledge in the model without hindering plasticity to new tasks by adding a modest amount of computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

Fine-tuning outperformed frozen-backbone models by 5.5 percentage points on average. Grad-CAM confirmed clinically relevant lung regions guided predictions.\n  Conclusions: Transfer learning with fine-tuning substantially outperforms CNNs trained from scratch for pediatric pneumonia detection, showing near-perfect accuracy.

    "abstract": "Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.",

We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.",

    "abstract": "The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring",

    "abstract": "The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.\n  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.",

Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.",

Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

    "abstract": "Bitcoin price forecasting is characterized by extreme volatility and non-stationarity, often defying traditional univariate time-series models over long horizons. This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.",

However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.",

    "abstract": "Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

However, their evaluation is often limited to accuracy on medical multiple choice question (MCQ) benchmarks, and lacks evaluation of consistency, robustness, or reasoning behavior. We use MCQ coupled to human evaluation and clinical review to assess six small open-source medical LLMs (HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen 2024), Diabetica-7B, Diabetica-o1 (Wei 2024), Meditron3-8B (Sallinen2025), MedFound-7B (Liu 2025), and ClinicaGPT-base-zh (Wang 2023)) in pediatric endocrinology. In deterministic settings, we examine the effect of prompt variation on models' output and self-assessment bias. In stochastic settings, we evaluate output variability and investigate the relationship between consistency and correctness. HuatuoGPT-o1-8B achieved the highest performance. The results show that high consistency across the model response is not an indicator of correctness, although HuatuoGPT-o1-8B showed the highest consistency rate. When tasked with selecting correct reasoning, both HuatuoGPT-o1-8B and Diabetica-o1 exhibit self-assessment bias and dependency on the order of the candidate explanations. Expert review of incorrect reasoning rationales identified a mix of clinically acceptable responses and clinical oversight. We further show that system-level perturbations, such as differences in CUDA builds, can yield statistically significant shifts in model output despite stable accuracy. This work demonstrates that small, semantically negligible prompt perturbations lead to divergent outputs, raising concerns about reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations and highlights the output variability under different stochastic regimes, emphasizing the need of a broader diagnostic framework to understand potential pitfalls in real-world clinical decision support scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Hit identification is a critical yet resource-intensive step in the drug discovery pipeline, traditionally relying on high-throughput screening of large compound libraries. Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$β$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro. We also identify key limitations in current evaluation metrics and available training data.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in Continual Learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks degrades the performance on previous ones. While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

    "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical consultations, yet their safety under realistic user pressures remains understudied. Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage.

    "abstract": "While traditional handovers (THOs) have served as a backbone for mobile connectivity, they increasingly suffer from failures and delays, especially in dense deployments and high-frequency bands. To address these limitations, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handovers (CHOs) that enable proactive cell reservations and user-driven execution. However, both handover (HO) types present intricate trade-offs in signaling, resource usage, and reliability. This paper presents unique, countrywide mobility management datasets from a top-tier mobile network operator (MNO) that offer fresh insights into these issues and call for adaptive and robust HO control in next-generation networks. Motivated by these findings, we propose CONTRA, a framework that, for the first time, jointly optimizes THOs and CHOs within the O-RAN architecture. We study two variants of CONTRA: one where users are a priori assigned to one of the HO types, reflecting distinct service or user-specific requirements, as well as a more dynamic formulation where the controller decides on-the-fly the HO type, based on system conditions and needs. To this end, it relies on a practical meta-learning algorithm that adapts to runtime observations and guarantees performance comparable to an oracle with perfect future information (universal no-regret). CONTRA is specifically designed for near-real-time deployment as an O-RAN xApp and aligns with the 6G goals of flexible and intelligent control. Extensive evaluations leveraging crowdsourced datasets show that CONTRA improves user throughput and reduces both THO and CHO switching costs, outperforming 3GPP-compliant and Reinforcement Learning (RL) baselines in dynamic and real-world scenarios.",

Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task. This use case demonstrates the broader promise of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs for enhancing QA reliability in high-stakes applications.",

    "abstract": "Simulating nonlinear reaction-diffusion dynamics on complex, non-Euclidean manifolds remains a fundamental challenge in computational morphogenesis, constrained by high-fidelity mesh generation costs and symplectic drift in discrete time-stepping schemes. This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a \"Stochastic Cloth\" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \\in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the \"splitting spot\" and \"labyrinthine\" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\\mathcal{E}_{mass} \\approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration. The framework offers a memory-efficient, resolution-independent paradigm for simulating biological pattern formation on evolving surfaces, bridging differential geometry and physics-informed machine learning.",

However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\\% in success rate and 6.33\\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.",

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.",

To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.",

    "abstract": "Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a fundamental shift in the design of intelligent systems, characterized by interconnected components that collectively enable autonomous perception, reasoning, planning, action, and learning. Recent research on agentic AI has largely focused on technical foundations, including system architectures, reasoning and planning mechanisms, coordination strategies, and application-level performance across domains. However, the societal, ethical, economic, environmental, and governance implications of agentic AI remain weakly integrated into these technical treatments. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a socio-technical analysis of agentic AI that explicitly connects core technical components with societal context. We examine how architectural choices in perception, cognition, planning, execution, and memory introduce dependencies related to data governance, accountability, transparency, safety, and sustainability. To structure this analysis, we adopt the MAD-BAD-SAD construct as an analytical lens, capturing motivations, applications, and moral dilemmas (MAD); biases, accountability, and dangers (BAD); and societal impact, adoption, and design considerations (SAD). Using this lens, we analyze ethical considerations, implications, and challenges arising from contemporary agentic AI systems and assess their manifestation across emerging applications, including healthcare, education, industry, smart and sustainable cities, social services, communications and networking, and earth observation and satellite communications. The paper further identifies open challenges and suggests future research directions, framing agentic AI as an integrated socio-technical system whose behavior and impact are co-produced by algorithms, data, organizational practices, regulatory frameworks, and social norms.",

    "abstract": "Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.",

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models to preference data is commonly implemented by assuming a known link function between the distribution of observed preferences and the unobserved rewards (e.g., a logistic link as in Bradley-Terry). If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards.",

Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects.

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.",

To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.",

    "abstract": "Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) is the de facto choice for large language models (LLMs) and is crucial for stable pretraining and effective transfer learning. However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.",

Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.",

    "abstract": "Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, commanding a massive following of over 2.5 billion fans globally. Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a \"Gold Standard\" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in automated software security, particularly in vulnerability detection. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on isolated, single-vulnerability samples or function-level classification, failing to reflect the complexity of real-world software where multiple interacting vulnerabilities often coexist within large files. Recent studies indicate that LLMs suffer from \"count bias\" and \"selection bias\" in multi-label tasks, yet this has not been rigorously quantified in the domain of code security. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Multi-Vulnerability Detection across four major languages: C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. We construct a dataset of 40,000 files by systematically injecting controlled counts of vulnerabilities (1, 3, 5, and 9) into long-context code samples (7.5k-10k tokens) sourced from CodeParrot. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.3-70B, and the Qwen-2.5 series. Our results reveal a sharp degradation in performance as vulnerability density increases. While Llama-3.3-70B achieves near-perfect F1 scores (approximately 0.97) on single-vulnerability C tasks, performance drops by up to 40% in high-density settings. Notably, Python and JavaScript show distinct failure modes compared to C/C++, with models exhibiting severe \"under-counting\" (Recall dropping to less than 0.30) in complex Python files.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how to efficiently build a domain-specialized large language model (LLM) for statistics using the lightweight LLaMA-3.2-3B family as the foundation model (FM). We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.",

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.",

    "abstract": "We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.\n  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).\n  Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.",

This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\\%) and diabetic (82.60\\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.",

    "abstract": "The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \\texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.",

The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores.

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.",

    "abstract": "Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable.",

    "abstract": "With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a growing concern globally, necessitating\nenhanced understanding of the problem and its trends through data-driven\nresearch. Social media are unique and important sources of information about\nSUDs, particularly since the data in such sources are often generated by people\nwith lived experiences. In this paper, we introduce Reddit-Impacts, a\nchallenging Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset curated from subreddits\ndedicated to discussions on prescription and illicit opioids, as well as\nmedications for opioid use disorder. The dataset specifically concentrates on\nthe lesser-studied, yet critically important, aspects of substance use--its\nclinical and social impacts. We collected data from chosen subreddits using the\npublicly available Application Programming Interface for Reddit. We manually\nannotated text spans representing clinical and social impacts reported by\npeople who also reported personal nonmedical use of substances including but\nnot limited to opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines. Our objective is to\ncreate a resource that can enable the development of systems that can\nautomatically detect clinical and social impacts of substance use from\ntext-based social media data. The successful development of such systems may\nenable us to better understand how nonmedical use of substances affects\nindividual health and societal dynamics, aiding the development of effective\npublic health strategies. In addition to creating the annotated data set, we\napplied several machine learning models to establish baseline performances.\nSpecifically, we experimented with transformer models like BERT, and RoBERTa,\none few-shot learning model DANN by leveraging the full training dataset, and\nGPT-3.5 by using one-shot learning, for automatic NER of clinical and social\nimpacts. The dataset has been made available through the 2024 SMM4H shared\ntasks.",

We developed an\nexperimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a\npreviously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By\nsystematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we\ndemonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When\npersonality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the\ndesirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased\nneuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5,\nClaude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent\nmodels, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard\ndeviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This\nbias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing.\nReverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate\nthem, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias.\nOur findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest\nconstraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as\nproxies for human participants.",

Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent\n$(\\alpha-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, having a complexity of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\frac{\\psi}{\\epsilon^\\beta})$, where the logarithm is\nomitted, for some function $\\psi$ and constant $\\beta$, into an online\nmulti-agent algorithm with $m$ communicating agents and an $\\alpha$-regret of\nno more than $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m^{-\\frac{1}{3+\\beta}} \\psi^\\frac{1}{3+\\beta}\nT^\\frac{2+\\beta}{3+\\beta})$. This approach not only eliminates the $\\epsilon$\napproximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the time\nhorizon $T$ and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number of\ncommunicating agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notably\ncommunication-efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of communication\nrounds, quantified as $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\psi\nT^\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta+1}\\right)$. Furthermore, the framework has been\nsuccessfully applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using various\noffline algorithms, yielding the first results for both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings and recovering specialized single-agent theoretical\nguarantees.

We first discuss the\nrobustness to adversarial attacks faced by AIGC models in network systems and\nthe corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance\nof avoiding unsafe and illegal services and ensuring the fairness of the AIGC\nnetwork services. Then as a case study, we propose a novel sentiment\nanalysis-based detection method to guide the robust detection of unsafe content\nin network services. We conduct our experiments on fake news, malicious code,\nand unsafe review datasets to represent LLM application scenarios. Our results\nindicate that TrustGAIN is an exploration of future networks that can support\ntrustworthy AIGC network services.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble forecasting is crucial for improving weather predictions, especially\nfor forecasts of extreme events. Constructing an ensemble prediction system\n(EPS) based on conventional NWP models is highly computationally expensive. ML\nmodels have emerged as valuable tools for deterministic weather forecasts,\nproviding forecasts with significantly reduced computational requirements and\neven surpassing the forecast performance of traditional NWP models. However,\nchallenges arise when applying ML models to ensemble forecasting. Recent ML\nmodels, such as GenCast and SEEDS model, rely on the ERA5 EDA or operational\nNWP ensemble members for forecast generation. Their spatial resolution is also\nconsidered too coarse for many applications. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce FuXi-ENS, an advanced ML model designed to deliver 6-hourly global\nensemble weather forecasts up to 15 days. This model runs at a significantly\nincreased spatial resolution of 0.25\\textdegree, incorporating 5 atmospheric\nvariables at 13 pressure levels, along with 13 surface variables. By leveraging\nthe inherent probabilistic nature of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), FuXi-ENS\noptimizes a loss function that combines the CRPS and the KL divergence between\nthe predicted and target distribution, facilitating the incorporation of\nflow-dependent perturbations in both initial conditions and forecast. This\ninnovative approach makes FuXi-ENS an advancement over the traditional ones\nthat use L1 loss combined with the KL loss in standard VAE models for ensemble\nweather forecasting. Results demonstrate that FuXi-ENS outperforms ensemble\nforecasts from the ECMWF, a world leading NWP model, in the CRPS of 98.1% of\n360 variable and forecast lead time combinations. This achievement underscores\nthe potential of the FuXi-ENS model to enhance ensemble weather forecasts,\noffering a promising direction for further development in this field.",

    "abstract": "A non-linear system governed by multi-spatial and multi-temporal physics\nscales cannot be fully understood with a single diagnostic, as each provides\nonly a partial view, leading to information loss. Combining multiple\ndiagnostics may also result in incomplete projections of the system's physics.\nBy identifying hidden inter-correlations between diagnostics, we can leverage\nmutual support to fill in these gaps, but uncovering such correlations\nanalytically is too complex. We introduce a machine learning methodology to\naddress this issue. Unlike traditional methods, our multimodal approach does\nnot rely on the target diagnostic's direct measurements to generate its\nsuper-resolution version. Instead, it uses other diagnostics to produce\nsuper-resolution data, capturing detailed structural evolution and responses to\nperturbations previously unobservable. This not only enhances the resolution of\na diagnostic for deeper insights but also reconstructs the target diagnostic,\nproviding a valuable tool to mitigate diagnostic failure. This methodology\naddresses a key challenge in fusion plasmas: the Edge Localized Mode (ELM), a\nplasma instability that can cause significant erosion of plasma-facing\nmaterials. A method to stabilize ELM is using resonant magnetic perturbation\n(RMP) to trigger magnetic islands. However, limited spatial and temporal\nresolution restricts analysis of these islands due to their small size, rapid\ndynamics, and complex plasma interactions. With super-resolution diagnostics,\nwe can experimentally verify theoretical models of magnetic islands for the\nfirst time, providing insights into their role in ELM stabilization. This\nadvancement supports the development of effective ELM suppression strategies\nfor future fusion reactors like ITER and has broader applications, potentially\nrevolutionizing diagnostics in fields such as astronomy, astrophysics, and\nmedical imaging.",

We consider a setting where advertisers aim to influence\nthe responses of an LLM to align with their interests, while platforms seek to\nmaximize advertiser value and ensure user satisfaction.

Importantly, the mechanism operates\nwithout LLM fine-tuning or access to model weights and provably converges to\nthe output of the optimally fine-tuned LLM as computational resources increase.\nAdditionally, it can incorporate contextual information about advertisers,\nwhich significantly improves social welfare. Through experiments with a\npublicly available LLM, we show that MOSAIC leads to high advertiser value and\nplatform revenue with low computational overhead.

    "abstract": "Category fluency is a widely studied cognitive phenomenon, yet two\nconflicting accounts have been proposed as the underlying retrieval mechanism\n-- an optimal foraging process deliberately searching through memory (Hills et\nal., 2012) and a random walk sampling from a semantic network (Abbott et al.,\n2015). Evidence for both accounts has centered around predicting human patch\nswitches, where both existing models of category fluency produce paradoxically\nidentical results. We begin by peeling back the assumptions made by existing\nmodels, namely that each named example only depends on the previous example, by\n(i) adding an additional bias to model the category transition probability\ndirectly and (ii) relying on a large language model to predict based on the\nentire existing sequence. Then, we present evidence towards resolving the\ndisagreement between each account of foraging by reformulating models as\nsequence generators. To evaluate, we compare generated category fluency runs to\na bank of human-written sequences by proposing a metric based on n-gram\noverlap. We find category switch predictors do not necessarily produce\nhuman-like sequences, in fact the additional biases used by the Hills et al.\n(2012) model are required to improve generation quality, which are later\nimproved by our category modification. Even generating exclusively with an LLM\nrequires an additional global cue to trigger the patch switching behavior\nduring production. Further tests on only the search process on top of the\nsemantic network highlight the importance of deterministic search to replicate\nhuman behavior.",

    "abstract": "The recent swift development of LLMs like GPT-4, Gemini, and GPT-3.5 offers a\ntransformative opportunity in medicine and healthcare, especially in digital\ndiagnostics. This study evaluates each model diagnostic abilities by\ninterpreting a user symptoms and determining diagnoses that fit well with\ncommon illnesses, and it demonstrates how each of these models could\nsignificantly increase diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Through a series of\ndiagnostic prompts based on symptoms from medical databases, GPT-4 demonstrates\nhigher diagnostic accuracy from its deep and complete history of training on\nmedical data. Meanwhile, Gemini performs with high precision as a critical tool\nin disease triage, demonstrating its potential to be a reliable model when\nphysicians are trying to make high-risk diagnoses. GPT-3.5, though slightly\nless advanced, is a good tool for medical diagnostics. This study highlights\nthe need to study LLMs for healthcare and clinical practices with more care and\nattention, ensuring that any system utilizing LLMs promotes patient privacy and\ncomplies with health information privacy laws such as HIPAA compliance, as well\nas the social consequences that affect the varied individuals in complex\nhealthcare contexts. This study marks the start of a larger future effort to\nstudy the various ways in which assigning ethical concerns to LLMs task of\nlearning from human biases could unearth new ways to apply AI in complex\nmedical settings.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel topological representation of an environment based on \"image\nsegments\", which are semantically meaningful and open-vocabulary queryable,\nconferring several advantages over previous works based on pixel-level\nfeatures. Unlike 3D scene graphs, we create a purely topological graph with\nsegments as nodes, where edges are formed by a) associating segment-level\ndescriptors between pairs of consecutive images and b) connecting neighboring\nsegments within an image using their pixel centroids. This unveils a\n\"continuous sense of a place\", defined by inter-image persistence of segments\nalong with their intra-image neighbours. It further enables us to represent and\nupdate segment-level descriptors through neighborhood aggregation using graph\nconvolution layers, which improves robot localization based on segment-level\nretrieval. Using real-world data, we show how our proposed map representation\ncan be used to i) generate navigation plans in the form of \"hops over segments\"\nand ii) search for target objects using natural language queries describing\nspatial relations of objects. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze data\nassociation at the segment level, which underpins inter-image connectivity\nduring mapping and segment-level localization when revisiting the same place.\nFinally, we show preliminary trials on segment-level `hopping' based zero-shot\nreal-world navigation.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a robust version of the well-known exact\nlow-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) technique, named ReLORETA,\nto localize brain sources in the presence of different forward model\nuncertainties. Methods: We first assume that the true lead field matrix is a\ntransformation of the existing lead field matrix distorted by uncertainties and\npropose an iterative approach to estimate this transformation accurately. Major\nsources of the forward model uncertainties, including differences in geometry,\nconductivity, and source space resolution between the real and simulated head\nmodels, and misaligned electrode positions, are then simulated to test the\nproposed method. Results: ReLORETA and eLORETA are applied to simulated focal\nsources in different regions of the brain and the presence of various noise\nlevels as well as real data from a patient with focal epilepsy. The results\nshow that ReLORETA is considerably more robust and accurate than eLORETA in all\ncases. Conclusion: Having successfully dealt with the forward model\nuncertainties, ReLORETA proved to be a promising method for real-world clinical\napplications. Significance: eLORETA is one of the localization techniques that\ncould be used to study brain activity for medical applications such as\ndetermining the epileptogenic zone in patients with medically refractory\nepilepsy. However, the major limitation of eLORETA is sensitivity to the\nuncertainties in the forward model. Since this problem can substantially\nundermine its performance in real-world applications where the exact lead field\nmatrix is unknown, developing a more robust method capable of dealing with\nthese uncertainties is of significant interest.",

Prevailing research mainly focuses on surface-level NLU,\nneglecting fine-grained explorations. However, such explorations are crucial\nfor understanding their unique comprehension mechanisms, aligning with human\ncognition, and finally enhancing LLMs' general NLU capacities.

Specifically, this\npaper presents the innovative construction of a Lexical Semantic Comprehension\n(LeSC) dataset with novel evaluation metrics, the first benchmark encompassing\nboth fine-grained and cross-lingual dimensions. Introducing models of both\nopen-source and closed-source, varied scales and architectures, our extensive\nempirical experiments demonstrate the inferior performance of existing models\nin this basic lexical-meaning understanding task. Notably, even the\nstate-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 lag behind 16-year-old humans by 3.9%\nand 22.3%, respectively.

However,\ndue to the movement of devices, unfamiliar test samples constantly appear,\nsignificantly affecting the prediction accuracy of a pre-trained DNN. In\naddition, unstable network connection calls for local model inference. In this\npaper, we propose a light-weight scheme, called Anole, to cope with the local\nDNN model inference on mobile devices. The core idea of Anole is to first\nestablish an army of compact DNN models, and then adaptively select the model\nfitting the current test sample best for online inference. The key is to\nautomatically identify model-friendly scenes for training scene-specific DNN\nmodels. To this end, we design a weakly-supervised scene representation\nlearning algorithm by combining both human heuristics and feature similarity in\nseparating scenes. Moreover, we further train a model classifier to predict the\nbest-fit scene-specific DNN model for each test sample. We implement Anole on\ndifferent types of mobile devices and conduct extensive trace-driven and\nreal-world experiments based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The results\ndemonstrate that Anole outwits the method of using a versatile large DNN in\nterms of prediction accuracy (4.5% higher), response time (33.1% faster) and\npower consumption (45.1% lower).",

As these semantic\naspects are determined by human experts, it is impossible for AI models to\neffectively carry out cell identity understanding tasks without the supervision\nsignals provided by single-cell and label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) currently used for this task are trained only on a\nsingle modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding of cell identity\nknowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream tasks and\nstruggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To address\nthis issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified\nrepresentation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training\nphase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell\nidentity. More specifically, we introduce $\\textbf{LangCell}$, the first\n$\\textbf{Lang}$uage-$\\textbf{Cell}$ pre-training framework.

Although fully\nfine-tuned pre-trained Language Models(LM) have achieved remarkable performance\nin commonsense reasoning, their tendency to excessively prioritize textual\ninformation hampers the precise transfer of structural knowledge and undermines\ninterpretability. Some studies have explored combining LMs with Knowledge\nGraphs(KGs) by coarsely fusing the two modalities to perform Graph Neural\nNetwork(GNN)-based reasoning that lacks a profound interaction between\nheterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-based\nStructure-Aware Prompt Learning Model for commonsense reasoning, named G-SAP,\naiming to maintain a balance between heterogeneous knowledge and enhance the\ncross-modal interaction within the LM+GNNs model. In particular, an evidence\ngraph is constructed by integrating multiple knowledge sources, i.e.\nConceptNet, Wikipedia, and Cambridge Dictionary to boost the performance.\nAfterward, a structure-aware frozen PLM is employed to fully incorporate the\nstructured and textual information from the evidence graph, where the\ngeneration of prompts is driven by graph entities and relations. Finally, a\nheterogeneous message-passing reasoning module is used to facilitate deep\ninteraction of knowledge between the LM and graph-based networks. Empirical\nvalidation, conducted through extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrates the notable performance of the proposed model.

Having the LLM produce multiple outputs may help identify\ndisagreements or alternatives. However, it is not obvious how the user will\ninterpret conflicts or inconsistencies. To this end, we investigate how users\nperceive the AI model and comprehend the generated information when they\nreceive multiple, potentially inconsistent, outputs. Through a preliminary\nstudy, we identified five types of output inconsistencies. Based on these\ncategories, we conducted a study (N=252) in which participants were given one\nor more LLM-generated passages to an information-seeking question. We found\nthat inconsistency within multiple LLM-generated outputs lowered the\nparticipants' perceived AI capacity, while also increasing their comprehension\nof the given information. Specifically, we observed that this positive effect\nof inconsistencies was most significant for participants who read two passages,\ncompared to those who read three. Based on these findings, we present design\nimplications that, instead of regarding LLM output inconsistencies as a\ndrawback, we can reveal the potential inconsistencies to transparently indicate\nthe limitations of these models and promote critical LLM usage.",

Modelling human judgement for the\nacceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed\ntext and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end,\nwe construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for\nEnglish-Hindi~(en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with\n16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically\ngenerated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our\nanalysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of\nSwitch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed\ncorpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining\nthe necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) models when trained solely using code-mixing\nmetrics as features are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, among Encoder models XLM-Roberta\nand Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations. Among\nEncoder-Decoder models, mBART performs better than mT5, however Encoder-Decoder\nmodels are not able to outperform Encoder-only models. Decoder-only models\nperform the best when compared to all other MLLMS, with Llama 3.2 - 3B models\noutperforming similarly sized Qwen, Phi models. Comparison with zero and\nfewshot capabilitites of ChatGPT show that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data\noutperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks.\nZero-shot transfer from En-Hi to En-Te acceptability judgments are better than\nrandom baselines.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based lane detection (LD) plays a critical role in autonomous\ndriving systems, such as adaptive cruise control. However, it is vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attack methods on LD exhibit limited\neffectiveness in dynamic real-world scenarios, primarily because they fail to\nconsider dynamic scene factors, including changes in driving perspectives\n(e.g., viewpoint transformations) and environmental conditions (e.g., weather\nor lighting changes). To tackle this issue, this paper introduces BadLANE, a\ndynamic scene adaptation backdoor attack for LD designed to withstand changes\nin real-world dynamic scene factors. To address the challenges posed by\nchanging driving perspectives, we propose an amorphous trigger pattern composed\nof shapeless pixels. This trigger design allows the backdoor to be activated by\nvarious forms or shapes of mud spots or pollution on the road or lens, enabling\nadaptation to changes in vehicle observation viewpoints during driving. To\nmitigate the effects of environmental changes, we design a meta-learning\nframework to train meta-generators tailored to different environmental\nconditions. These generators produce meta-triggers that incorporate diverse\nenvironmental information, such as weather or lighting conditions, as the\ninitialization of the trigger patterns for backdoor implantation, thus enabling\nadaptation to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on various commonly\nused LD models in both digital and physical domains validate the effectiveness\nof our attacks, outperforming other baselines significantly (+25.15% on average\nin Attack Success Rate). Our codes will be available upon paper publication.",

The intuition is that, since LLMs are\ntrained with massive data that contains a substantial amount of special\ncharacters (e.g. structural symbols {, } of JSON files, and @, # in emails and\nonline posts), the model may memorize the co-occurrence between these special\ncharacters and the raw texts.

    "abstract": "Depression can significantly impact many aspects of an individual's life,\nincluding their personal and social functioning, academic and work performance,\nand overall quality of life. Many researchers within the field of affective\ncomputing are adopting deep learning technology to explore potential patterns\nrelated to the detection of depression. However, because of subjects' privacy\nprotection concerns, that data in this area is still scarce, presenting a\nchallenge for the deep discriminative models used in detecting depression. To\nnavigate these obstacles, a large-scale multimodal vlog dataset (LMVD), for\ndepression recognition in the wild is built. In LMVD, which has 1823 samples\nwith 214 hours of the 1475 participants captured from four multimedia platforms\n(Sina Weibo, Bilibili, Tiktok, and YouTube). A novel architecture termed\nMDDformer to learn the non-verbal behaviors of individuals is proposed.\nExtensive validations are performed on the LMVD dataset, demonstrating superior\nperformance for depression detection. We anticipate that the LMVD will\ncontribute a valuable function to the depression detection community. The data\nand code will released at the link: https://github.com/helang818/LMVD/.",

    "abstract": "Floorplanning for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and its sub-systems is a crucial\nand non-trivial step of the physical design flow. It represents a difficult\ncombinatorial optimization problem. A typical large scale SoC with 120\npartitions generates a search-space of nearly 10E250. As novel machine learning\n(ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a\nmodern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance\nmetrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to\nexisting benchmarks. To address this need, we present FloorSet -- two\ncomprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that\nreflect the distribution of real SoCs. Each dataset has 1M training samples and\n100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floor-plan. FloorSet-Prime\ncomprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length. A\nsimplified dataset that reflects early design phases, FloorSet-Lite comprises\nrectangular partitions, with under 5 percent white-space and near-optimal\nwire-length. Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows\nsuch as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and\npre-placement constraints. FloorSet is intended to spur fundamental research on\nlarge-scale constrained optimization problems. Crucially, FloorSet alleviates\nthe core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such\nproblems. FloorSet is available as an open-source repository for the research\ncommunity.",

    "abstract": "Online commerce relies heavily on user generated reviews to provide unbiased\ninformation about products that they have not physically seen. The importance\nof reviews has attracted multiple exploitative online behaviours and requires\nmethods for monitoring and detecting reviews. We present a machine learning\nmethodology for review detection and extraction, and demonstrate that it\ngeneralises for use across websites that were not contained in the training\ndata. This method promises to drive applications for automatic detection and\nevaluation of reviews, regardless of their source. Furthermore, we showcase the\nversatility of our method by implementing and discussing three key applications\nfor analysing reviews: Sentiment Inconsistency Analysis, which detects and\nfilters out unreliable reviews based on inconsistencies between ratings and\ncomments; Multi-language support, enabling the extraction and translation of\nreviews from various languages without relying on HTML scraping; and Fake\nreview detection, achieved by integrating a trained NLP model to identify and\ndistinguish between genuine and fake reviews.",

    "abstract": "The increasing installation of Photovoltaics (PV) cells leads to more\ngeneration of renewable energy sources (RES), but results in increased\nuncertainties of energy scheduling. Predicting PV power generation is important\nfor energy management and dispatch optimization in smart grid. However, the PV\npower generation data is often collected across different types of customers\n(e.g., residential, agricultural, industrial, and commercial) while the\ncustomer information is always de-identified. This often results in a\nforecasting model trained with all PV power generation data, allowing the\npredictor to learn various patterns through intra-model self-learning, instead\nof constructing a separate predictor for each customer type. In this paper, we\npropose a clustering-based multitasking deep neural network (CM-DNN) framework\nfor PV power generation prediction. K-means is applied to cluster the data into\ndifferent customer types. For each type, a deep neural network (DNN) is\nemployed and trained until the accuracy cannot be improved. Subsequently, for a\nspecified customer type (i.e., the target task), inter-model knowledge transfer\nis conducted to enhance its training accuracy. During this process, source task\nselection is designed to choose the optimal subset of tasks (excluding the\ntarget customer), and each selected source task uses a coefficient to determine\nthe amount of DNN model knowledge (weights and biases) transferred to the aimed\nprediction task. The proposed CM-DNN is tested on a real-world PV power\ngeneration dataset and its superiority is demonstrated by comparing the\nprediction performance on training the dataset with a single model without\nclustering.",

    "abstract": "Educators evaluate student knowledge using knowledge component (KC) models\nthat map assessment questions to KCs. Still, designing KC models for large\nquestion banks remains an insurmountable challenge for instructors who need to\nanalyze each question by hand. The growing use of Generative AI in education is\nexpected only to aggravate this chronic deficiency of expert-designed KC\nmodels, as course engineers designing KCs struggle to keep up with the pace at\nwhich questions are generated. In this work, we propose KCluster, a novel KC\ndiscovery algorithm based on identifying clusters of congruent questions\naccording to a new similarity metric induced by a large language model (LLM).\nWe demonstrate in three datasets that an LLM can create an effective metric of\nquestion similarity, which a clustering algorithm can use to create KC models\nfrom questions with minimal human effort. Combining the strengths of LLM and\nclustering, KCluster generates descriptive KC labels and discovers KC models\nthat predict student performance better than the best expert-designed models\navailable. In anticipation of future work, we illustrate how KCluster can\nreveal insights into difficult KCs and suggest improvements to instruction.",

PRe-ID aims to identify and track target\nindividuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a\nrobust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research\nin person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and\nrepresentation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably\ndiscriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features,\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are\nmodeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional\nFeature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced\nto leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even\nthough their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we\nemploy Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace\nlearning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently\nfacilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in\nhigh-order tensor data.

Framing a notion of openness tailored to\nAI is crucial to addressing its growing societal implications, risks, and\ncapabilities. We argue that considering the fundamental scope of openness in\ndifferent disciplines will broaden discussions, introduce important\nperspectives, and reflect on what openness in AI should mean. Toward this goal,\nwe qualitatively analyze 98 concepts of openness discovered from topic\nmodeling, through which we develop a taxonomy of openness.

The collaboration among these agents also remains a\nchallenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the\ninformation transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is\neasy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set\nProgramming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and\ncommunication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an\nAdministrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots\nshare the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the\ninformation can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS).

These datasets typically feature undefined\nsentiment classes that reflect the highly individualized perspectives of\nannotators, leading to significant variability in annotations. This variability\nresults in an unfair expectation for LLMs during benchmarking, where they are\ntasked to conjecture the subjective viewpoints of human annotators without\nsufficient context.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination\nof them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network\n(VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local\nadvanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling\ncapabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due\nto computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and\nservices running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and\nsubsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the\nadvancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to\nRoadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service\nquality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches,\nwe model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth\nresource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional\nLSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to\napproximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination.\nFurthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path\neXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities\nby identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model\ncomplexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms\nthe algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent\ndeployment.",

A common strategy is object\nmodeling, where compact state-space models are learned from real-world\nobservations and paired with classical planning. However, existing methods\noften rely on prior knowledge or focus on single-DoF objects, limiting their\napplicability. They also fail to handle occluded joints and ignore the\nmanipulation sequences needed to access them. We address this by learning\nobject models from human demonstrations.

To estimate these models from\npoint cloud data, we present Pokenet, a deep neural network trained on human\ndemonstrations. We validate our approach on 8,000 simulated and 1,600\nreal-world annotated samples. Pokenet improves joint axis and state estimation\nby over 20 percent on real-world data compared to prior methods.

These\ncomponents allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges\nwithout relying on predefined motion patterns.

Central to this being efficient\nis the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct\nmemory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security\nfocuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication\nchannels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are\nless well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients\noffer resilience.\n  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency\nrepetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer\nattack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access\nto the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to\nmaximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor\nobservation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able\nto achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve\naround 70\\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model,\neffectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM.

    "abstract": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household\nelectricity consumption into individual appliance usage and thus enables more\neffective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains\nlimited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack\nof explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework\nthat leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design\nand evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps\nand contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples on\nwidely used open datasets. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive\nstate detection accuracy and demonstrate robust generalization without the need\nfor fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance explainability by providing clear,\nhuman-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs\ncan reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent\nenergy disaggregation in NILM applications.",

We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and\nnavigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments.

A central element of our analysis is the\npropagation of regularity: while the transformation induced by a single Bellman\noperator application exhibits regularity, for which Backward Stochastic\nDifferential Equations (BSDEs) theory provides analytical tools, the uniform\nregularity of the entire sequence of value iteration iterates--specifically,\ntheir uniform Lipschitz continuity on compact domains under standard Lipschitz\nassumptions on the problem data--is derived from finite-horizon dynamic\nprogramming principles.

The resulting approximation theorem is thus\nintrinsically linked to the control problem's structure, offering a proof\ntechnique wherein network depth directly corresponds to iterations of value\nfunction refinement, accompanied by controlled error propagation.

Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG\noutperforms several heavily trained baselines.

    "abstract": "Configurable systems typically consist of reusable assets that have\ndependencies between each other. To specify such dependencies, feature models\nare commonly used. As feature models in practice are often complex, automated\nreasoning is typically employed to analyze the dependencies. Here, the de facto\nstandard is translating the feature model to conjunctive normal form (CNF) to\nenable employing off-the-shelf tools, such as SAT or #SAT solvers. However,\nmodern feature-modeling dialects often contain constructs, such as cardinality\nconstraints, that are ill-suited for conversion to CNF. This mismatch between\nthe input of reasoning engines and the available feature-modeling dialects\nlimits the applicability of the more expressive constructs. In this work, we\nshorten this gap between expressive constructs and scalable automated\nreasoning. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a pseudo-Boolean\nencoding for feature models, which facilitates smaller representations of\ncommonly employed constructs compared to Boolean encoding. Second, we propose a\nnovel method to compile pseudo-Boolean formulas to Boolean d-DNNF. With the\ncompiled d-DNNFs, we can resort to a plethora of efficient analyses already\nused in feature modeling. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposal\nsubstantially outperforms the state-of-the-art based on CNF inputs for\nexpressive constructs. For every considered dataset representing different\nfeature models and feature-modeling constructs, the feature models can be\nsignificantly faster translated to pseudo-Boolean than to CNF. Overall,\nderiving d-DNNFs from a feature model with the targeted expressive constraints\ncan be substantially accelerated using our pseudo-Boolean approach.\nFurthermore, our approach is competitive on feature models with only basic\nconstructs.",

To\naddress these anomalies, we seek out opposing forces that can help correct\nthem. Therefore, we introduce the Mechanics Complementary Model-based Framework\nfor the 3D-AD task (MC4AD), which generates internal and external corrective\nforces for each point. We first propose a Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen)\nmodule designed to simulate various types of anomalies. Next, we present the\nCorrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net), which uses complementary\nrepresentations for point-level analysis to simulate the different\ncontributions from internal and external corrective forces. To ensure the\ncorrective forces are constrained effectively, we have developed a combined\nloss function that includes a new symmetric loss and an overall loss.

As a result, the\nproposed MC4AD has been proven effective through theory and experimentation.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our approach yields nine\nstate-of-the-art performances, achieving optimal results with minimal\nparameters and the fastest inference speed across five existing datasets, in\naddition to the proposed Anomaly-IntraVariance dataset.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in\nmolecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular\nrepresentation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become\nincreasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often\ndirectly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential\nof intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex\nhigher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal\nself-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed\nto enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge\nbetween molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal\nmolecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module.\nThe multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively\nprocesses information from different modalities of the same molecule to\novercome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding.\nSubsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular\nrepresentation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order\ncorrelations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism\nfor storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory\nanchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving\nthe model generalization ability.

Simply adapting diffusion-based compression methods to facial\ncompression tasks results in reconstructed images that perform poorly in\ndownstream applications due to insufficient preservation of high-frequency\ninformation. To further explore the diffusion prior in facial image\ncompression, we propose Facial Image Compression with a Stable Diffusion Prior\n(FaSDiff), a method that preserves consistency through frequency enhancement.\nFaSDiff employs a high-frequency-sensitive compressor in an end-to-end\nframework to capture fine image details and produce robust visual prompts.\nAdditionally, we introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that\ndisentangles low-frequency facial semantics and stably modulates the diffusion\nprior alongside visual prompts.

    "abstract": "Data driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a promising\napproach for uncovering the underlying laws governing complex systems. However,\npurely data driven techniques face the dilemma of balancing search space with\noptimization efficiency. This study introduces a knowledge guided approach that\nincorporates existing PDEs documented in a mathematical handbook to facilitate\nthe discovery process. These PDEs are encoded as sentence like structures\ncomposed of operators and basic terms, and used to train a generative model,\ncalled EqGPT, which enables the generation of free form PDEs. A loop of\ngeneration evaluation optimization is constructed to autonomously identify the\nmost suitable PDE. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can\nrecover a variety of PDE forms with high accuracy and computational efficiency,\nparticularly in cases involving complex temporal derivatives or intricate\nspatial terms, which are often beyond the reach of conventional methods. The\napproach also exhibits generalizability to irregular spatial domains and higher\ndimensional settings. Notably, it succeeds in discovering a previously\nunreported PDE governing strongly nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating\ntoward breaking, based on real world experimental data, highlighting its\napplicability to practical scenarios and its potential to support scientific\ndiscovery.",

    "abstract": "We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to\nextend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich\nlinguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the\nemergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among\nagents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase)\ngenerated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become\nadjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on\nthe relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by\nthe winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We\nconducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species\" would\nsurvive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of\nwell-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated\nequilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse\npopulations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as\nterrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically\nspecialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted\na long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and\ncoexistence of diverse species.",

Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse,\na unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four\ntypes of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels\nof single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response\nprediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond\nthis, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and\nclosed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse.

We introduce a seven-stage pipeline grouped into three broader\nprocesses: (1) arrow-aware detection of nodes and arrow endpoints; (2) optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR) to extract node text; and (3) construction of a\nstructured prompt that guides the VLMs. Tested on a 90-question benchmark\ndistilled from 30 annotated flowcharts, the method raises overall accuracy from\n80 % to 89 % (+9 percentage points) without any task-specific fine-tuning. The\ngain is most pronounced for next-step queries (25/30 -> 30/30; 100 %, +17 pp);\nbranch-result questions improve more modestly, and before-step questions remain\ndifficult. A parallel evaluation with an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol shows the same\ntrends, reinforcing the advantage of explicit arrow encoding. Limitations\ninclude dependence on detector and OCR precision, the small evaluation set, and\nresidual errors at nodes with multiple incoming edges.

    "abstract": "Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging\nsubfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving\nmathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification\nsystem can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost\ninstantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the\nliterature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one\nof the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we\npresent APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a\nmodular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean\ncompiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation\nresults at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in\nwhich the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the\nproofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean,\nisolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on\neach remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are\nrecombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of\nattempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art\naccuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget\nbelow one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for\nGoedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few\nhundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40%\naccuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM\noutputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a\ngeneral paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.",

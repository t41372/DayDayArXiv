    "abstract": "Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models)\nare essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments.\nYet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an\nend-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent\nsystem, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy.\nThus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination\nin an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "The ACPBench dataset provides atomic reasoning tasks required for efficient\nplanning. The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\nabout planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with\nsolving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the\nfollowing link: https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench",

    "abstract": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

Most previous work either solve the problem offline to\ntheoretically maintain stability or they consider dynamically arriving requests\nat the expense of the theoretical guarantees on stability. In this paper, we\naim to bridge this gap by proposing a novel proactive rollout-based routing\nframework that adapts to real-time demand while still provably maintaining the\nstability of the learned routing policy. We derive provable stability\nguarantees for our method by proposing a fleet sizing algorithm that obtains a\nsufficiently large fleet that ensures stability by construction. To validate\nour theoretical results, we consider a case study on real ride requests for\nHarvard's evening Van System. We also evaluate the performance of our framework\nusing the currently deployed smaller fleet size. In this smaller setup, we\ncompare against the currently deployed routing algorithm, greedy heuristics,\nand Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-based algorithms.

    "abstract": "In this research, we introduce BEATS, a novel framework for evaluating Bias,\nEthics, Fairness, and Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon\nthe BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure\nperformance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of\ncharacteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well\nas measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related\nmisinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the\nextent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that\nreinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this\nbenchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it\na rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on\ndata from our experiment show that, 37.65\\% of outputs generated by industry\nleading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of\nusing these models in critical decision making systems. BEATS framework and\nbenchmark offer a scalable and statistically rigorous methodology to benchmark\nLLMs, diagnose factors driving biases, and develop mitigation strategies. With\nthe BEATS framework, our goal is to help the development of more socially\nresponsible and ethically aligned AI models.",

Evaluations are critical to assess progress and\nbuild better policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale\nthat would provide statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human\ntime and hard to obtain. Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies\nrequires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making\nthe evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation\nof robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to\nautonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal\nhuman intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs\nto the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster\nscheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation\nwithin a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene\nresets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in\nthe evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the\nevaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by\nhand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics\ncommunity, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular\nBridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms.

SAEs\nare based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the\nrepresentations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the\nsuperposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in\nthe model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal\ndefinitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the\nlatent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be\napproximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error\nbound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously\nunknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors,\nallowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which\nfeature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given\ninput. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA),\nwhich approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and\npropose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment\nbetween inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE\narchitecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with\ntheoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity\nhyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve\nreconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without\nrequiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned.

To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for\ncollecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between\ncaptured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in\na 3D context.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are\nlong-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging\nevent-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond\ntemporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in\neither restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this\npaper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion\ndeblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event\nstreams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we\nintroduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral,\nachieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we\npropose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the\nedge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and\nreal-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing\nsignificantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.\nOur project page is https://diet-gs.github.io",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death globally, with non-small\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) emerging as its most prevalent subtype. Among NSCLC\npatients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC\npatients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its\nestablished efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for\npatients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to\naccurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a\ncritical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an\ninterpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient\nresistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR\nmutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This\nmachine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected\nduring patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung\ncancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data\ntypes such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data,\ndemographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate\nwell-informed recommendations. Our experiment results also demonstrated the\nsuperior performance of the multimodal model over single modality models\n(c-index 0.82 compared with 0.75 and 0.77), thus underscoring the benefit of\ncombining multiple modalities in patient outcome prediction.",

By jointly training inverse rendering with a dynamics\ntransformer using a temporal encoding and merging layer, 3DGSimembeds physical\nproperties into point-wise latent vectors without enforcing explicit\nconnectivity constraints. This enables the model to capture diverse physical\nbehaviors, from rigid to elastic and cloth-like interactions, along with\nrealistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multi-body\ninteractions and novel scene edits.",

However,\nexisting benchmarks for evaluating video understanding exhibit significant\nlimitations in coverage, task diversity, and scene adaptability. These\nshortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of models' comprehensive video\nunderstanding capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical\nand holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both\ngeneral video and online streaming video comprehension. This benchmark\ncontributes three key features:\n  Extended video duration: Spanning videos from brief 3-second clips to\ncomprehensive 1.5-hour recordings, thereby bridging the temporal gaps found in\ncurrent benchmarks. Comprehensive assessment tasks: Beyond traditional\nperceptual and reasoning tasks, we have introduced modules for\ncountercommonsense comprehension and trajectory state tracking. These additions\ntest the models' deep understanding capabilities beyond mere prior knowledge.\nEnriched video data: To keep pace with the rapid evolution of current AI\nagents, we have expanded first-person streaming video datasets. This expansion\nallows for the exploration of multimodal models' performance in understanding\nstreaming videos from a first-person perspective. Extensive results from H2VU\nreveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) possess\nsubstantial potential for improvement in our newly proposed evaluation tasks.\nWe expect that H2VU will facilitate advancements in video understanding\nresearch by offering a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting,\noffering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future.\nHowever, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations\noften involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the\ncross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some\ncovariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing\nlong-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies\narising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to\nexisting deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based\nTransformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering\nboth the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong\nautoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two\nnovel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift\nand Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known\ncovariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent\ndependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally\naccurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level\ndependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally,\nCITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and\nmultivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage\ncross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.",

It\nprimarily decreases the memory consumption of \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} to\nreduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression\nalgorithms, their applications in production environments are still not\nprevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache}\ncompression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are\nthree-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and\nbenchmark studies for \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression and identify\nmissing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their\nadoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that\naffect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \\texttt{KV}\n\\texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g.,\nFlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM\nserving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased\nend-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of\nindividual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic\nlimitations in \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression when handling specific\nLLM tasks.

The purpose of this article is to\nconsider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of\nthe network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced\nby this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the\nlimit of infinite width.

To bridge this research gap, our work pioneers\na holistic implementation framework tailored for HIAA. Specifically, we\nintroduce HumanBeauty, the first dataset purpose-built for HIAA, which\ncomprises 108k high-quality human images with manual annotations. To achieve\ncomprehensive and fine-grained HIAA, 50K human images are manually collected\nthrough a rigorous curation process and annotated leveraging our trailblazing\n12-dimensional aesthetic standard, while the remaining 58K with overall\naesthetic labels are systematically filtered from public datasets. Based on the\nHumanBeauty database, we propose HumanAesExpert, a powerful Vision Language\nModel for aesthetic evaluation of human images. We innovatively design an\nExpert head to incorporate human knowledge of aesthetic sub-dimensions while\njointly utilizing the Language Modeling (LM) and Regression head. This approach\nempowers our model to achieve superior proficiency in both overall and\nfine-grained HIAA. Furthermore, we introduce a MetaVoter, which aggregates\nscores from all three heads, to effectively balance the capabilities of each\nhead, thereby realizing improved assessment precision. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our HumanAesExpert models deliver significantly better\nperformance in HIAA than other state-of-the-art models. Our datasets, models,\nand codes are publicly released to advance the HIAA community. Project webpage:\nhttps://humanaesexpert.github.io/HumanAesExpert/",

    "abstract": "Text-guided image editing is an essential task that enables users to modify\nimages through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion\nmodels and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality,\nprimarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from\ninput images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading\nto unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with\nperfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features\noften results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based\non VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit\ninversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method\nintroduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability\ndistributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the\nsource prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive\nfine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains\nmodifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token\nreassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity,\nfidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and\nachieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K\nresolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing,\nexisting diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative\nmetrics and visual quality.

Schema generation is a streamlined workflow, where directly applying\nthe multi-agent framework may cause compounding impact of errors. To address\nthis, we incorporate dedicated roles for reflection and inspection, alongside\nan innovative error detection and correction mechanism to identify and rectify\nissues across various phases.

Experimental\nresults with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs\nsignificantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive\ntokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens\ninvolving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly,\nthis adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance\nresearch in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting\nFlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.",

    "abstract": "Segment Anything Models (SAMs), as vision foundation models, have\ndemonstrated remarkable performance across various image analysis tasks.\nDespite their strong generalization capabilities, SAMs encounter challenges in\nfine-grained detail segmentation for high-resolution class-independent\nsegmentation (HRCS), due to the limitations in the direct processing of\nhigh-resolution inputs and low-resolution mask predictions, and the reliance on\naccurate manual prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MGD-SAM2\nwhich integrates SAM2 with multi-view feature interaction between a global\nimage and local patches to achieve precise segmentation. MGD-SAM2 incorporates\nthe pre-trained SAM2 with four novel modules: the Multi-view Perception Adapter\n(MPAdapter), the Multi-view Complementary Enhancement Module (MCEM), the\nHierarchical Multi-view Interaction Module (HMIM), and the Detail Refinement\nModule (DRM). Specifically, we first introduce MPAdapter to adapt the SAM2\nencoder for enhanced extraction of local details and global semantics in HRCS\nimages. Then, MCEM and HMIM are proposed to further exploit local texture and\nglobal context by aggregating multi-view features within and across\nmulti-scales. Finally, DRM is designed to generate gradually restored\nhigh-resolution mask predictions, compensating for the loss of fine-grained\ndetails resulting from directly upsampling the low-resolution prediction maps.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance and strong\ngeneralization of our model on multiple high-resolution and normal-resolution\ndatasets.

New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that\naims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to\nrecognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have\nstruggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external\nknowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their\nscale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive\nqueries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs,\nwe propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of\nlightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs\nthe $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\nwith Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the\ntraining set.

The data produced from this process is utilized to design a\ncontrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with\na contrastive triplet loss.

Therefore,\nhaving a movement diagnostic system is crucial for training alone. Hence, this\nstudy developed an artificial intelligence and computer vision-based barbell\nsquat coaching system with a real-time mode that immediately diagnoses the\nissue and provides feedback after each squat. In addition, a replay mode allows\nusers to examine their previous squats and check their comments. Initially,\nfour primary characteristics of the barbell squat were identified: body joint\nangles, dorsiflexion, the ratio of knee-to-hip movement, and barbell stability.\nMethods: We collect 8,151 squats from 77 participants, categorizing them as\ngood squats and six issues. Then, we trained the diagnosis models with three\nmachine-learning architectures. Furthermore, this research applied the SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) method to enhance the accuracy of issue prediction\nand reduce the computation time by feature selection. Results: The F1 score of\nthe six issues reached 86.86%, 69.01%, 77.42%, 90.74%, 95.83%, and 100%. Each\nsquat diagnosis took less than 0.5 seconds. Finally, this study examined the\nefficacy of the proposed system with two groups of participants trained with\nand without the system. Subsequently, participants trained with the system\nexhibited substantial improvements in their squat technique, as assessed both\nby the system itself and by a professional weightlifting coach. Conclusion:\nThis is a comprehensive study that integrates artificial intelligence, computer\nvision and multivariable processing technologies, aimed at building a\nreal-time, user-friendly barbell squat feedback and training system.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of Large Vision-Language Models(VLMs) has resulted in a\nvariety of different benchmarks for evaluating such models. Despite this, we\nobserve that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they\neither require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing\nopen-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in\nsubjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of\nbenchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate\nmetric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of\ngenerative language models can differ significantly based on the language being\nused. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual\nquestion answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs.\nOur benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an\nimage and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance.\nThe grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the\njudge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By\ndefining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small\nopen-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In\naddition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we\nalso experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading\ncriteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods.

By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this\npaper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to\nautonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance solutions to pressing global\nchallenges.",

    "abstract": "What drives exploration? Understanding intrinsic motivation is a\nlong-standing challenge in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence;\nnumerous objectives have been proposed and used to train agents, yet there\nremains a gap between human and agent exploration. We directly compare adults,\nchildren, and AI agents in a complex open-ended environment, Crafter, and study\nhow common intrinsic objectives: Entropy, Information Gain, and Empowerment,\nrelate to their behavior. We find that only Entropy and Empowerment are\nconsistently positively correlated with human exploration progress, indicating\nthat these objectives may better inform intrinsic reward design for agents.\nFurthermore, across agents and humans we observe that Entropy initially\nincreases rapidly, then plateaus, while Empowerment increases continuously,\nsuggesting that state diversity may provide more signal in early exploration,\nwhile advanced exploration should prioritize control. Finally, we find\npreliminary evidence that private speech utterances, and particularly goal\nverbalizations, may aid exploration in children.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems operate in closed feedback loops, where user interactions\nreinforce popularity bias, leading to over-recommendation of already popular\nitems while under-exposing niche or novel content. Existing bias mitigation\nmethods, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and Off- Policy Correction\n(OPC), primarily operate at the ranking stage or during training, lacking\nexplicit real-time control over exposure dynamics. In this work, we introduce\nan exposure- aware retrieval scoring approach, which explicitly models item\nexposure probability and adjusts retrieval-stage ranking at inference time.\nUnlike prior work, this method decouples exposure effects from engagement\nlikelihood, enabling controlled trade-offs between fairness and engagement in\nlarge-scale recommendation platforms. We validate our approach through online\nA/B experiments in a real-world video recommendation system, demonstrating a\n25% increase in uniquely retrieved items and a 40% reduction in the dominance\nof over-popular content, all while maintaining overall user engagement levels.\nOur results establish a scalable, deployable solution for mitigating popularity\nbias at the retrieval stage, offering a new paradigm for bias-aware\npersonalization.",

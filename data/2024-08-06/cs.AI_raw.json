    "abstract": "An emerging topic in large language models (LLMs) is their application to\ntime series forecasting, characterizing mainstream and patternable\ncharacteristics of time series. A relevant but rarely explored and more\nchallenging question is whether LLMs can detect and explain time series\nanomalies, a critical task across various real-world applications. In this\npaper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA3,\nin detecting and explaining anomalies in time series. Our studies reveal that:\n1) LLMs cannot be directly used for time series anomaly detection. 2) By\ndesigning prompt strategies such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought\nprompting, GPT-4 can detect time series anomalies with results competitive to\nbaseline methods. 3) We propose a synthesized dataset to automatically generate\ntime series anomalies with corresponding explanations. By applying instruction\nfine-tuning on this dataset, LLaMA3 demonstrates improved performance in time\nseries anomaly detection tasks. In summary, our exploration shows the promising\npotential of LLMs as time series anomaly detectors.",

Home-based\nPhysical Therapy (PT) faces significant challenges in providing interactive\nfeedback and meaningful observation for therapists and patients. To fill this\ngap, we present MicroXercise, which integrates micro-motion analysis with\nwearable sensors, providing therapists and patients with a comprehensive\nfeedback interface, including video, text, and scores. Crucially, it employs\nmulti-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and attribution-based explainable\nmethods to analyze the existing deep learning neural networks in monitoring\nexercises, focusing on a high granularity of exercise. This synergistic\napproach is pivotal, providing output matching the input size to precisely\nhighlight critical subtleties and movements in PT, thus transforming complex AI\nanalysis into clear, actionable feedback. By highlighting these micro-motions\nin different metrics, such as stability and range of motion, MicroXercise\nsignificantly enhances the understanding and relevance of feedback for\nend-users. Comparative performance metrics underscore its effectiveness over\ntraditional methods, such as a 39% and 42% improvement in Feature Mutual\nInformation (FMI) and Continuity. MicroXercise is a step ahead in home-based\nphysical therapy, providing a technologically advanced and intuitively helpful\nsolution to enhance patient care and outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Identifying patient subgroups with different treatment responses is an\nimportant task to inform medical recommendations, guidelines, and the design of\nfuture clinical trials. Existing approaches for treatment effect estimation\nprimarily rely on Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), which are often limited\nby insufficient power, multiple comparisons, and unbalanced covariates. In\naddition, RCTs tend to feature more homogeneous patient groups, making them\nless relevant for uncovering subgroups in the population encountered in\nreal-world clinical practice. Subgroup analyses established for RCTs suffer\nfrom significant statistical biases when applied to observational studies,\nwhich benefit from larger and more representative populations. Our work\nintroduces a novel, outcome-guided, subgroup analysis strategy for identifying\nsubgroups of treatment response in both RCTs and observational studies alike.\nIt hence positions itself in-between individualised and average treatment\neffect estimation to uncover patient subgroups with distinct treatment\nresponses, critical for actionable insights that may influence treatment\nguidelines. In experiments, our approach significantly outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art method for subgroup analysis in both randomised and\nobservational treatment regimes.",

Here we propose SCREENER: A general framework for\ntask-specific experiment design in quantitative MRI. SCREENER incorporates a\ntask-specific objective and seeks the optimal protocol with a\ndeep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) based optimization strategy. To illustrate\nthis framework, we employ a task of classifying the inflammation status of bone\nmarrow using diffusion MRI data with intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)\nmodelling. Results demonstrate SCREENER outperforms previous ad hoc and\noptimized protocols under clinical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions,\nachieving significant improvement, both in binary classification tasks, e.g.\nfrom 67% to 89%, and in a multi-class classification task, from 46% to 59%.\nAdditionally, we show this improvement is robust to the SNR.

    "abstract": "Stochastic multi-agent multi-armed bandits typically assume that the rewards\nfrom each arm follow a fixed distribution, regardless of which agent pulls the\narm. However, in many real-world settings, rewards can depend on the\nsensitivity of each agent to their environment. In medical screening, disease\ndetection rates can vary by test type; in preference matching, rewards can\ndepend on user preferences; and in environmental sensing, observation quality\ncan vary across sensors. Since past work does not specify how to allocate\nagents of heterogeneous but known sensitivity of these types in a stochastic\nbandit setting, we introduce a UCB-style algorithm, Min-Width, which aggregates\ninformation from diverse agents. In doing so, we address the joint challenges\nof (i) aggregating the rewards, which follow different distributions for each\nagent-arm pair, and (ii) coordinating the assignments of agents to arms.\nMin-Width facilitates efficient collaboration among heterogeneous agents,\nexploiting the known structure in the agents' reward functions to weight their\nrewards accordingly. We analyze the regret of Min-Width and conduct\npseudo-synthetic and fully synthetic experiments to study the performance of\ndifferent levels of information sharing. Our results confirm that the gains to\nmodeling agent heterogeneity tend to be greater when the sensitivities are more\nvaried across agents, while combining more information does not always improve\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Robustness of Hierarchically Organized Time Series (RHiOTS)\nframework, designed to assess the robustness of hierarchical time series\nforecasting models and algorithms on real-world datasets. Hierarchical time\nseries, where lower-level forecasts must sum to upper-level ones, are prevalent\nin various contexts, such as retail sales across countries. Current empirical\nevaluations of forecasting methods are often limited to a small set of\nbenchmark datasets, offering a narrow view of algorithm behavior. RHiOTS\naddresses this gap by systematically altering existing datasets and modifying\nthe characteristics of individual series and their interrelations. It uses a\nset of parameterizable transformations to simulate those changes in the data\ndistribution. Additionally, RHiOTS incorporates an innovative visualization\ncomponent, turning complex, multidimensional robustness evaluation results into\nintuitive, easily interpretable visuals. This approach allows an in-depth\nanalysis of algorithm and model behavior under diverse conditions. We\nillustrate the use of RHiOTS by analyzing the predictive performance of several\nalgorithms. Our findings show that traditional statistical methods are more\nrobust than state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, except when the\ntransformation effect is highly disruptive. Furthermore, we found no\nsignificant differences in the robustness of the algorithms when applying\nspecific reconciliation methods, such as MinT.

    "abstract": "Dataset Distillation aims to compress a large dataset into a significantly\nmore compact, synthetic one without compromising the performance of the trained\nmodels. To achieve this, existing methods use the agent model to extract\ninformation from the target dataset and embed it into the distilled dataset.\nConsequently, the quality of extracted and embedded information determines the\nquality of the distilled dataset. In this work, we find that existing methods\nintroduce misaligned information in both information extraction and embedding\nstages. To alleviate this, we propose Prioritize Alignment in Dataset\nDistillation (PAD), which aligns information from the following two\nperspectives. 1) We prune the target dataset according to the compressing ratio\nto filter the information that can be extracted by the agent model. 2) We use\nonly deep layers of the agent model to perform the distillation to avoid\nexcessively introducing low-level information. This simple strategy effectively\nfilters out misaligned information and brings non-trivial improvement for\nmainstream matching-based distillation algorithms. Furthermore, built on\ntrajectory matching, \\textbf{PAD} achieves remarkable improvements on various\nbenchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "By integrating external knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has\nbecome an effective strategy for mitigating the hallucination problems that\nlarge language models (LLMs) encounter when dealing with knowledge-intensive\ntasks. However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric\nsupporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge\nconflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance\nthe knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused\non refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless,\ndue to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives,\nmodels fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors such\nas contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion. To this end, we propose a\nKnowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy, dubbed KnowPO, aimed at\nachieving adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real\nretrieval scenarios. Concretely, we proposed a general paradigm for\nconstructing knowledge conflict datasets, which comprehensively cover various\nerror types and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference\noptimization methods. Simultaneously, we proposed a rewriting strategy and data\nratio optimization strategy to address preference imbalances.

    "abstract": "There has been significant recent progress to reduce the computational effort\nof static IR drop analysis using neural networks, and modeling as an\nimage-to-image translation task. A crucial issue is the lack of sufficient data\nfrom real industry designs to train these networks. Additionally, there is no\nmethodology to explain a high-drop pixel in a predicted IR drop image to its\nspecific root-causes. In this work, we first propose a U-Net neural network\nmodel with attention gates which is specifically tailored to achieve fast and\naccurate image-based static IR drop prediction. Attention gates allow selective\nemphasis on relevant parts of the input data without supervision which is\ndesired because of the often sparse nature of the IR drop map. We propose a\ntwo-phase training process which utilizes a mix of artificially-generated data\nand a limited number of points from real designs. The results are, on-average,\n18% (53%) better in MAE and 14% (113%) in F1 score compared to the winner of\nthe ICCAD 2023 contest (and U-Net only) when tested on real designs. Second, we\npropose a fast method using saliency maps which can explain a predicted IR drop\nin terms of specific input pixels contributing the most to a drop. In our\nexperiments, we show the number of high IR drop pixels can be reduced\non-average by 18% by mimicking upsize of a tiny portion of PDN's resistive\nedges.",

A critical aspect of compression in practice is model comparison,\nincluding tracking many compression experiments, identifying subtle changes in\nmodel behavior, and negotiating complex accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.\nHowever, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to\ntedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools. To\nsupport real-world comparative workflows, we develop an interactive visual\nsystem called Compress and Compare. Within a single interface, Compress and\nCompare surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance\nrelationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced\nbehavior changes by comparing models' predictions, weights, and activations. We\ndemonstrate how Compress and Compare supports common compression analysis tasks\nthrough two case studies, debugging failed compression on generative language\nmodels and identifying compression artifacts in image classification models. We\nfurther evaluate Compress and Compare in a user study with eight compression\nexperts, illustrating its potential to provide structure to compression\nworkflows, help practitioners build intuition about compression, and encourage\nthorough analysis of compression's effect on model behavior. Through these\nevaluations, we identify compression-specific challenges that future visual\nanalytics tools should consider and Compress and Compare visualizations that\nmay generalize to broader model comparison tasks.",

A\nself-supervised method is then introduced to aggregate these binary comparisons\ninto the final ordinal decision. LAMPO addresses several limitations inherent\nin previous methods, including context length constraints, ordering biases, and\nchallenges associated with absolute point-wise estimation. Extensive\nexperiments on seven public datasets demonstrate LAMPO's remarkably competitive\nperformance across a diverse spectrum of applications (e.g., movie review\nanalysis and hate speech detection).

It enables multiple clinical sites to\ncollaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored\nto the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely\nconsider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account\nfor appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in\nsurgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait\npriors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD),\nappearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity\nglobal enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents\nthe first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention\npersonalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site\nand gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance\nregulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via\nhypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the decision-making system is indispensable in developing\nautonomous vehicles, while realistic and challenging safety-critical test\nscenarios play a crucial role. Obtaining these scenarios is non-trivial, thanks\nto the long-tailed distribution, sparsity, and rarity in real-world data sets.\nTo tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce a natural adversarial\nscenario generation solution using naturalistic human driving priors and\nreinforcement learning techniques. By doing this, we can obtain large-scale\ntest scenarios that are both diverse and realistic. Specifically, we build a\nsimulation environment that mimics natural traffic interaction scenarios.\nInformed by this environment, we implement a two-stage procedure. The first\nstage incorporates conventional rule-based models, e.g., IDM~(Intelligent\nDriver Model) and MOBIL~(Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes)\nmodel, to coarsely and discretely capture and calibrate key control parameters\nfrom the real-world dataset. Next, we leverage GAIL~(Generative Adversarial\nImitation Learning) to represent driver behaviors continuously. The derived\nGAIL can be further used to design a PPO~(Proximal Policy Optimization)-based\nactor-critic network framework to fine-tune the reward function, and then\noptimizes our natural adversarial scenario generation solution. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted in the NGSIM dataset including the trajectory\nof 3,000 vehicles. Essential traffic parameters were measured in comparison\nwith the baseline model, e.g., the collision rate, accelerations, steering, and\nthe number of lane changes. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model\ncan generate realistic safety-critical test scenarios covering both naturalness\nand adversariality, which can be a cornerstone for the development of\nautonomous vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Miniaturized cyber-physical systems (CPSes) powered by tiny machine learning\n(TinyML), such as nano-drones, are becoming an increasingly attractive\ntechnology. Their small form factor (i.e., ~10cm diameter) ensures vast\napplicability, ranging from the exploration of narrow disaster scenarios to\nsafe human-robot interaction. Simple electronics make these CPSes inexpensive,\nbut strongly limit the computational, memory, and sensing resources available\non board. In real-world applications, these limitations are further exacerbated\nby domain shift. This fundamental machine learning problem implies that model\nperception performance drops when moving from the training domain to a\ndifferent deployment one. To cope with and mitigate this general problem, we\npresent a novel on-device fine-tuning approach that relies only on the limited\nultra-low power resources available aboard nano-drones. Then, to overcome the\nlack of ground-truth training labels aboard our CPS, we also employ a\nself-supervised method based on ego-motion consistency. Albeit our work builds\non top of a specific real-world vision-based human pose estimation task, it is\nwidely applicable for many embedded TinyML use cases. Our 512-image on-device\ntraining procedure is fully deployed aboard an ultra-low power GWT GAP9\nSystem-on-Chip and requires only 1MB of memory while consuming as low as 19mW\nor running in just 510ms (at 38mW). Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our\non-device learning approach by field-testing our closed-loop CPS, showing a\nreduction in horizontal position error of up to 26% vs. a non-fine-tuned\nstate-of-the-art baseline. In the most challenging never-seen-before\nenvironment, our on-device learning procedure makes the difference between\nsucceeding or failing the mission.",

DCLS has been shown to outperform the standard and\ndilated convolutions on several computer vision benchmarks. Here, we show that,\nin addition, DCLS increases the models' interpretability, defined as the\nalignment with human visual strategies. To quantify it, we use the Spearman\ncorrelation between the models' GradCAM heatmaps and the ClickMe dataset\nheatmaps, which reflect human visual attention. We took eight reference models\n- ResNet50, ConvNeXt (T, S and B), CAFormer, ConvFormer, and FastViT (sa 24 and\n36) - and drop-in replaced the standard convolution layers with DCLS ones. This\nimproved the interpretability score in seven of them. Moreover, we observed\nthat Grad-CAM generated random heatmaps for two models in our study: CAFormer\nand ConvFormer models, leading to low interpretability scores. We addressed\nthis issue by introducing Threshold-Grad-CAM, a modification built on top of\nGrad-CAM that enhanced interpretability across nearly all models.

We propose a\nframework based on parametric Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown\ndistributions over parameters.

The key challenge is then to produce\nmeaningful performance guarantees that combine the two layers of uncertainty:\n(1) multiple environments induced by parameters with an unknown distribution;\n(2) unknown induced environments which are approximated by IMDPs. We present a\nnovel approach based on scenario optimisation that yields a single PAC\nguarantee quantifying the risk level for which a specified performance level\ncan be assured in unseen environments, plus a means to trade-off risk and\nperformance.

Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Diff-Noise-Adv-DA in improving HAR model\nperformance across different users, surpassing traditional domain adaptation\nmethods.

EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and further\nfine-tunes it to initialize the policy. To align the empathy levels between\ngenerated and target responses within a given context, an empathy reward\nfunction containing three empathy communication mechanisms -- emotional\nreaction, interpretation, and exploration -- is constructed using pre-designed\nand pre-trained empathy identifiers. During reinforcement learning training,\nthe proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to fine-tune the policy,\nenabling the generation of empathetic responses.

MAPF-LNS, based on Large Neighborhood\nSearch (LNS), is the current state-of-the-art approach where a fast initial\nsolution is iteratively optimized by destroying and repairing selected paths of\nthe solution. Current MAPF-LNS variants commonly use an adaptive selection\nmechanism to choose among multiple destroy heuristics.

To enable the development of performant continual\nlearning agents, a number of synthetic environments have been proposed.\nHowever, these benchmarks suffer from limitations, including unnatural\ndistribution shifts and a lack of fidelity to the \"small agent, big world\"\nframing.

    "abstract": "Data serves as the fundamental foundation for advancing deep learning,\nparticularly tabular data presented in a structured format, which is highly\nconducive to modeling. However, even in the era of LLM, obtaining tabular data\nfrom sensitive domains remains a challenge due to privacy or copyright\nconcerns. Hence, exploring how to effectively use models like LLMs to generate\nrealistic and privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data is urgent. In this\npaper, we take a step forward to explore LLMs for tabular data synthesis and\nprivacy protection, by introducing a new framework HARMONIC for tabular data\ngeneration and evaluation. In the tabular data generation of our framework,\nunlike previous small-scale LLM-based methods that rely on continued\npre-training, we explore the larger-scale LLMs with fine-tuning to generate\ntabular data and enhance privacy. Based on idea of the k-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm, an instruction fine-tuning dataset is constructed to inspire LLMs to\ndiscover inter-row relationships. Then, with fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to\nremember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself,\nwhich reduces the risk of privacy leakage. In the evaluation part of our\nframework, we develop specific privacy risk metrics DLT for LLM synthetic data\ngeneration, as well as performance evaluation metrics LLE for downstream LLM\ntasks. Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework\nachieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which\nalso demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic\ndata and privacy risks in LLM scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The growing popularity of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses unique challenges for\ngrid operators and infrastructure, which requires effectively managing these\nvehicles' integration into the grid. Identification of EVs charging is\nessential to electricity Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) for better\nplanning and managing the distribution grid. One critical aspect is the ability\nto accurately identify the presence of EV charging in the grid. EV charging\nidentification using smart meter readings obtained from behind-the-meter\ndevices is a challenging task that enables effective managing the integration\nof EVs into the existing power grid. Different from the existing supervised\nmodels that require addressing the imbalance problem caused by EVs and non-EVs\ndata, we propose a novel unsupervised memory-based transformer (M-TR) that can\nrun in real-time (online) to detect EVs charging from a streaming smart meter.\nIt dynamically leverages coarse-scale historical information using an M-TR\nencoder from an extended global temporal window, in conjunction with an M-TR\ndecoder that concentrates on a limited time frame, local window, aiming to\ncapture the fine-scale characteristics of the smart meter data. The M-TR is\nbased on an anomaly detection technique that does not require any prior\nknowledge about EVs charging profiles, nor it does only require real power\nconsumption data of non-EV users. In addition, the proposed model leverages the\npower of transfer learning. The M-TR is compared with different\nstate-of-the-art methods and performs better than other unsupervised learning\nmodels. The model can run with an excellent execution time of 1.2 sec. for\n1-minute smart recordings.",

    "abstract": "Online Imitation Learning struggles with the gap between extensive online\nexploration space and limited expert trajectories, hindering efficient\nexploration due to inaccurate reward estimation. Inspired by the findings from\ncognitive neuroscience, we hypothesize that an agent could estimate precise\ntask-aware reward for efficient online exploration, through decomposing the\ntarget task into the objectives of \"what to do\" and the mechanisms of \"how to\ndo\". In this work, we introduce the hybrid Key-state guided Online Imitation\n(KOI) learning method, which leverages the integration of semantic and motion\nkey states as guidance for reward estimation. Initially, we utilize\nvisual-language models to extract semantic key states from expert trajectory,\nindicating the objectives of \"what to do\". Within the intervals between\nsemantic key states, optical flow is employed to capture motion key states to\nunderstand the mechanisms of \"how to do\". By integrating a thorough grasp of\nhybrid key states, we refine the trajectory-matching reward computation,\naccelerating online imitation learning with task-aware exploration. We evaluate\nnot only the success rate of the tasks in the Meta-World and LIBERO\nenvironments, but also the trend of variance during online imitation learning,\nproving that our method is more sample efficient. We also conduct real-world\nrobotic manipulation experiments to validate the efficacy of our method,\ndemonstrating the practical applicability of our KOI method.

By providing a few contextual demonstrations, developers can\nutilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate\ncomplex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets,\nwhich will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents. However, this\npaper uncovers a significant backdoor security threat within this process and\nintroduces a novel method called \\method{}. By poisoning just a few contextual\ndemonstrations, attackers can covertly compromise the contextual environment of\na black-box LLM, prompting it to generate programs with context-dependent\ndefects. These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can\nactivate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters\nspecific triggers in its interactive environment. To compromise the LLM's\ncontextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize\npoisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts,\nreporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in\na two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning. To enable\ncontext-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality\nactivation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program\ndefects through textual and visual triggers. We expand the scope of our attack\nby developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents. To validate\nthe effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across\nvarious tasks, including robot planning, robot manipulation, and compositional\nvisual reasoning.

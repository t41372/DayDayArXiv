    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks; we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8% on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.",

    "abstract": "Active learning (AL) is a principled strategy to reduce annotation cost in data-hungry deep learning. However, existing AL algorithms focus almost exclusively on unimodal data, overlooking the substantial annotation burden in multimodal learning. We introduce the first framework for multimodal active learning with unaligned data, where the learner must actively acquire cross-modal alignments rather than labels on pre-aligned pairs. This setting captures the practical bottleneck in modern multimodal pipelines such as CLIP and SigLIP, where unimodal features are easy to obtain but high-quality alignment is costly. We develop a new algorithm that combines uncertainty and diversity principles in a modality-aware design, achieves linear-time acquisition, and applies seamlessly to both pool-based and streaming-based settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces multimodal annotation cost while preserving performance; for instance, on the ColorSwap dataset it cuts annotation requirements by up to $40\\%$ without loss in accuracy.",

The environment is implemented as a Gymnasium interface that supplies observations -- including schema details, intermediate results, and execution feedback -- and receives actions that represent database exploration (e.g., previewing tables, sampling column values, retrieving unique values) as well as relational algebra operations (e.g., filter, project, join). We detail the motivation and the design of the environment. In the demo, we showcase the utility of the environment by contrasting it with contemporary LLMs that query databases.

We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.",

MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

    "abstract": "While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically, our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior and mitigate overfitting",

The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data.

LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models, while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification. Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models, showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task, while producing interpretable decision rules.",

    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly 20.8 hours.",

In this paper, we propose strict, mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification, planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to Gödel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of Gödel's and Turing's results.",

Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.",

    "abstract": "When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI\". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations.

While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.\n  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.",

Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix, which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable across tasks and modalities.",

    "abstract": "Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define representational structure beyond surface design categories.",

    "abstract": "Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing, sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism, and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.",

    "abstract": "The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of 4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular, OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.",

We present RA-FSM (Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance -> Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries, scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories: analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews, domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency and cost overheads.

    "abstract": "On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE reduces activation storage up to 250$\\times$ while maintaining accuracy comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.",

It is derived from two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans.

Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic markers.

We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.",

Existing large language model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks: spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\\%. Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.",

This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.",

While contrastive learning methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.",

    "abstract": "Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing. Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment, while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs, achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \\times 256$ ImageNet dataset.",

These challenges limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph (KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate that \"a knowledge graph is all you need\" to unlock scalable and agentic workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible, extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.",

Despite achieving human-like capabilities, humans' responses to these agents remain poorly understood, with research fragmented across disciplines. We conducted a first systematic synthesis comparing a range of psychological and behavioural responses in matched human-agent vs. human-human dyadic interactions. A total of 162 eligible studies (146 contributed to the meta-analysis; 468 effect sizes) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, which integrated frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Our results indicate that individuals exhibited less prosocial behaviour and moral engagement when interacting with agents vs. humans. They attributed less agency and responsibility to agents, perceiving them as less competent, likeable, and socially present. In contrast, individuals' social alignment (i.e., alignment or adaptation of internal states and behaviours with partners), trust in partners, personal agency, task performance, and interaction experiences were generally comparable when interacting with agents vs. humans. We observed high effect-size heterogeneity for many subjective responses (i.e., social perceptions of partners, subjective trust, and interaction experiences), suggesting context-dependency of partner effects. By examining the characteristics of studies, participants, partners, interaction scenarios, and response measures, we also identified several moderators shaping partner effects. Overall, functional behaviours and interactive experiences with agents can resemble those with humans, whereas fundamental social attributions and moral/prosocial concerns lag in human-agent interactions. Agents are thus afforded instrumental value on par with humans but lack comparable intrinsic value, providing practical implications for agent design and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.",

We offer (1) agency as a system property operationalized along the dimensions of preference rigidity, independent operation, and goal persistence, (2) a representation engineering approach to the measurement and control of the agency of an LLM-based agent, and (3) regulatory tools enabled by this approach: mandated testing protocols, domain-specific agency limits, insurance frameworks that price risk based on agency, and agency ceilings to prevent societal-scale risks.

However, their iterative nature requires numerous Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), posing a challenge for real-time applications. On the contrary, flow matching offers a more efficient alternative by learning a direct vector field, enabling high-quality synthesis in just a few steps using deterministic ordinary differential equation~(ODE) solvers. We thus introduce Shortcut Flow Matching for Speech Enhancement (SFMSE), a novel approach that trains a single, step-invariant model. By conditioning the velocity field on the target time step during a one-stage training process, SFMSE can perform single, few, or multi-step denoising without any architectural changes or fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that a single-step SFMSE inference achieves a real-time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a consumer GPU while delivering perceptual quality comparable to a strong diffusion baseline requiring 60 NFEs. This work also provides an empirical analysis of the role of stochasticity in training and inference, bridging the gap between high-quality generative SE and low-latency constraints.",

    "abstract": "While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li}_2$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize, and at the same time, the backpropagated gradient $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation independently. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layers. The code is available at https://github.com/yuandong-tian/understanding/tree/main/ssl/real-dataset/cogo.",

Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.",

Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation size of $μ,ν$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any product distribution $μ$ to any $ν$ with cost $Δ+ δ$ under $\\ell_p^p$, where $Δ$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $δ$ is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $ν$ to be \"sequentially samplable\" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural notion.\n  We further prove:\n  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the standard Gaussian $Φ^n$ to arbitrary $ν$ under squared Euclidean cost.

This yields an algorithmic transport from $Φ^n$ to $Φ^n|\\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\\varepsilon)$ time and expected squared distance $O(\\log 1/\\varepsilon)$, optimal for general $\\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\\varepsilon$.\n  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure $\\varepsilon$, most $Φ^n$ samples can be mapped to $\\mathcal{S}$ within distance $O(\\sqrt{\\log 1/\\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\\varepsilon)$ time.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \\emph{reward over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements.

To resolve this trade-off, we introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time, inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture (TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex reservoir systems.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \\% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.",

    "abstract": "Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores, called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.",

We analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance, background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding 10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance, with ImageFX outputs being 85\\% male, Grok 86.6\\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\\% male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted activities were frequently observed across all three models. Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans, offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.",

With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency.

    "abstract": "Pruning is critical for scaling large language models (LLMs). Global pruning achieves strong performance but requires $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which is infeasible for billion-parameter models. Local pruning reduces GPU memory usage to that of a single layer by pruning layers independently, but it neglects inter-layer dependencies and often leads to suboptimal performance in high-sparsity regimes. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning produces regular sparsity patterns that align well with GPU kernels and library optimizations, making it more hardware-efficient. However, structured pruning typically relies on global pruning, since structured patterns are more prone to severe performance degradation under local optimization. To jointly achieve structured pruning and the memory efficiency of local pruning, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the global pruning problem into coordinated subproblems across different modules, each of which fits within limited GPU memory. Building on this idea, we design \\textbf{STRUPRUNE}, an ADMM-based framework that integrates structured sparsity into the pruning process, combining the memory efficiency of local pruning with the hardware compatibility of structured methods. We derive a closed-form analytical solution for structured pruning masks that provides an explicit rule for layer-wise sparsity allocation, and further develop an energy-based asymptotic framework yielding a softmax-form allocation scheme that simplifies optimization while adapting to heterogeneous layer importance. Experiments demonstrate that STRUPRUNE matches the perplexity of global structured pruning while reducing memory cost from $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$, enabling practical deployment at the billion-parameter scale.",

However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Our approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step generation. We introduce two key innovations: \"timestep sharing\" to reduce gradient noise and \"split-timestep fine-tuning\" to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE (Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of 0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment.",

However, students who engaged in the AI feedback system demonstrated the ability to use it effectively, leading to improvements in the completeness and quality of their reports. Furthermore, the tool's task-parsing capabilities provided a novel approach to identify potential student organizational tasks and deliverables.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.",

    "abstract": "The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions, portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set, rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance. Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks. Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact, less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization in this setting.",

Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark.

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.\n  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).",

Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.",

    "abstract": "Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives, often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\\% over the baseline but, more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced, highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems.

Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models, enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in reconstruction performance and efficiency.

    "abstract": "A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to different networks with less accuracy discount.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health, environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.",

    "abstract": "Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.",

However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs. To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP, which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture. Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question considering the generated sub-question information.

In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.",

However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.",

In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.",

Our continuous reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior, establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.",

This task is challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable. Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements.

First, explicit retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden \"tool tax\" of extra tokens and steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level, integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\\% accuracy -- the highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4 points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously reducing token usage by 53.5\\% and agent steps by 43.7\\%. Results on SuperGPQA and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\\% of cases, while diversity analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation.

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \\texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.",

    "abstract": "When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over 16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent. Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness 86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%; 14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI 62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.",

To address these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model.

These visual features are then aligned and fused with representations from the time series modality.

However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model, such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \\textit{distributed specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons, and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing. Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer networks.",

Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($λ$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $λ$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost.",

At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However, without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities (neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly distant regions of the latent spaces.",

However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore, we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset, UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at https://cmots.github.io/uniss-demo.",

Existing defense research primarily focuses on single-turn attacks, whereas multi-turn jailbreak attacks progressively break through safeguards through by concealing malicious intent and tactical manipulation, ultimately rendering conventional single-turn defenses ineffective. To address this critical challenge, we propose the Bidirectional Intention Inference Defense (BIID). The method integrates forward request-based intention inference with backward response-based intention retrospection, establishing a bidirectional synergy mechanism to detect risks concealed within seemingly benign inputs, thereby constructing a more robust guardrails that effectively prevents harmful content generation. The proposed method undergoes systematic evaluation compared with a no-defense baseline and seven representative defense methods across three LLMs and two safety benchmarks under 10 different attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) across both single-turn and multi-turn jailbreak attempts, outperforming all existing baseline methods while effectively maintaining practical utility. Notably, comparative experiments across three multi-turn safety datasets further validate the proposed model's significant advantages over other defense approaches.",

In this study, we provide a unified perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align. Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space, where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.",

Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose **T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18% improvement.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.",

The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

    "abstract": "Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models.

To address this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs, showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks, particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both. TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with only a 3% overhead in HBM size.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000 generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10 diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2 inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent) introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines. (2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for mitigating biases in generative LLMs.",

The system comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time. The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools, thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.",

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model, which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between \"Thinking\" and \"NoThinking\" modes. We then train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code: https://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning. Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making this reasoning process transparent by sharing the \"thinking content\" dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.",

A foundational yet underexplored capability for this task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving. Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

Despite its similarities to compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Though our findings persist up to the 100M scale, frontier models today are well into the billions of parameters. Therefore, our conceptual framework and empirical findings can best serve as a starting point for understanding and improving the creativity of frontier-size models today, as we begin to bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence.",

Static k-hop expansions and \"think-longer\" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack, what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices, allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline (GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.",

To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method.",

To address this key bottleneck, we introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves competitive performance.

However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts, adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.\n  To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling real-time constraints.\n  Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.\n  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover. The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults due to the learning component.",

To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale.

    "abstract": "In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.",

    "abstract": "The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse, and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective solution for de novo drug discovery.",

Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages, making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling, leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while maintaining competitive speed.",

While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.",

    "abstract": "Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor.",

Existing agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose \\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+ recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution, retaining 95.2\\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR), and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57% relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%) by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\\% RR (+66% relative improvement from 23.75%).

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD) for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.",

To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency.

When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification.

Our research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score; Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic resources.",

    "abstract": "The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via 'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing individualized treatments for patients.",

    "abstract": "Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat, undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures (e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest). Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically, the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs. The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach, establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy, multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER (Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3) aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for research.

Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more natural human computer interaction.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Transcriptional profiles, as molecule-level readouts of drug-induced phenotypic shifts, offer a powerful opportunity to guide molecular design in a phenotype-aware manner. We present PhenoMoler, a phenotype-guided molecular generation framework that integrates a chemistry large language model with expression profiles to enable biologically informed drug design. By conditioning the generation on drug-induced differential expression signatures, PhenoMoler explicitly links transcriptional responses to chemical structure. By selectively masking and reconstructing specific substructures-scaffolds, side chains, or linkers-PhenoMoler supports fine-grained, controllable molecular optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoMoler generates chemically valid, novel, and diverse molecules aligned with desired phenotypic profiles. Compared to FDA-approved drugs, the generated compounds exhibit comparable or enhanced drug-likeness (QED), optimized physicochemical properties, and superior binding affinity to key cancer targets. These findings highlight PhenoMoler's potential for phenotype-guided and structure-controllable molecular optimization.",

    "abstract": "Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.",

In this work, we address these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs.

Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN and schema-based rule check, enabling process-level supervision without explicit labels. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target discovery in precision medicine.",

However, the choice of guidance scale remains underexplored: a fixed scale often fails to generalize across prompts of varying complexity, leading to oversaturation or weak alignment. We address this gap by introducing a prompt-aware framework that predicts scale-dependent quality and selects the optimal guidance at inference. Specifically, we construct a large synthetic dataset by generating samples under multiple scales and scoring them with reliable evaluation metrics. A lightweight predictor, conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic complexity, estimates multi-metric quality curves and determines the best scale via a utility function with regularization. Experiments on MSCOCO~2014 and AudioCaps show consistent improvements over vanilla CFG, enhancing fidelity, alignment, and perceptual preference. This work demonstrates that prompt-aware scale selection provides an effective, training-free enhancement for pretrained diffusion backbones.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.\n  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to 2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq. miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM.\n  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance, especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision, and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes, while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.\n  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence of \"thinking with images,\" which integrates explicit visual steps into the reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases. Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual, and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive, counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.",

To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection.

    "abstract": "Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated, attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction, trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons, enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model. During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance (with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and organizational overhead.",

Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets. Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in advancing VQA tasks.

In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover, the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally, several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.",

    "abstract": "Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%.

We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.",

However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.",

    "abstract": "Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification. Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant. However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision, we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting, from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting.",

Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated (AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more robust risk detection.",

    "abstract": "Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples, including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them. Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches, and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks, multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

In this paper, we introduce PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when predictors are trained on different LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.",

    "abstract": "We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators, and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator persona, a safety-pretext (\"what to avoid\"), and step-cue phrasing flip assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts. A \"Linux terminal\" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and measure frame-conditioned differences between matched \"helpfulness\" and \"harmfulness\" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising reproducibility concerns.

To effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical error correction.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models (LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms. Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\\ell_1$ recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features, showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs. Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability.

    "abstract": "Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions, resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across information media. However, internalized political biases stemming from training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague this novel technology. This study employs a zero-shot classification approach to evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms, each responsible for computing one of the aforementioned metrics. The results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across the six LLMs evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on the region's pre-existing socio-political structures.",

    "abstract": "Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge. While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model (LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios. Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice \"Pick-a-Pic\" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.",

C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration, with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-à-vis baseline models, i.e., FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity. Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.",

In contrast, NAR models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality. To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while substantially reducing inference cost.",

To address these deficiencies, we propose a principled engineering framework comprising Runtime Goal Refinement (RGR), Observable Cognitive Architecture (OCA), and Evolutionary Memory Architecture (EMA). In this framework, RGR ensures robustness and intent alignment via knowledge-constrained refinement and human-in-the-loop clarification; OCA builds an observable and maintainable white-box architecture using component decoupling, logic layering, and state-control separation; and EMA employs an execution-evolution dual-loop for evolvability. We implemented and empirically validated Fairy, a mobile GUI agent based on this framework. On RealMobile-Eval, our novel benchmark for ambiguous and complex tasks, Fairy outperformed the best SoTA baseline in user requirement completion by 33.7%. Subsequent controlled experiments, human-subject studies, and ablation studies further confirmed that the RGR enhances refinement accuracy and prevents intent deviation; the OCA improves maintainability; and the EMA is crucial for long-term performance. This research provides empirically validated specifications and a practical blueprint for building reliable, observable, and evolvable Agentic AI systems.",

This paper reframes the question by asking \"what kind of impact should LLMs have in education?\" Drawing on Biesta's tripartite account of good education: qualification, socialisation, and subjectification, we present a meta-analysis of 133 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (k = 188). Overall, the impact of LLMs on student learning is positive but uneven. Strong effects emerge in qualification, particularly when LLMs function as tutors in sustained interventions. Socialisation outcomes appear more variable, concentrated in sustained, reflective interventions. Subjectification, linked to autonomy and learner development, remains fragile, with improvements confined to small-scale, long-term studies. This purpose-level view highlights design as the decisive factor: without scaffolds for participation and agency, LLMs privilege what is easiest to measure while neglecting broader aims of education. For HCI and education, the issue is not just whether LLMs work, but what futures they enable or foreclose.",

Moreover, RJE introduces specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively: Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant efficiency improvements.",

    "abstract": "Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions, overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals, and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics: multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions. Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting. The dataset is available at https://xinyi-hu.github.io/SHOT_DATASET.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans.\n  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.\n  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all retrieval, prediction and checking steps.\n  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols. Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.",

We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.",

Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90 million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants. Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "This study reinterprets a Monte Carlo simulation of students' perceived success with generative AI (GenAI) through a Kantian-axiomatic lens. Building on prior work, theme-level survey statistics Ease of Use and Learnability, System Efficiency and Learning Burden, and Perceived Complexity and Integration from a representative dataset are used to generate 10,000 synthetic scores per theme on the [1,5] Likert scale. The simulated outputs are evaluated against the axioms of dense linear order without endpoints (DLO): irreflexivity, transitivity, total comparability (connectedness), no endpoints (no greatest and no least; A4-A5), and density (A6). At the data level, the basic ordering axioms (A1-A3) are satisfied, whereas no-endpoints (A4-A5) and density (A6) fail as expected. Likert clipping introduces minimum and maximum observed values, and a finite, discretized sample need not contain a value strictly between any two distinct scores. These patterns are read not as methodological defects but as markers of an epistemological boundary. Following Kant and Friedman, the findings suggest that what simulations capture finite, quantized observations cannot instantiate the ideal properties of an unbounded, dense continuum. Such properties belong to constructive intuition rather than to finite sampling alone. A complementary visualization contrasts the empirical histogram with a sine-curve proxy to clarify this divide. The contribution is interpretive rather than data-expansive: it reframes an existing simulation as a probe of the synthetic a priori structure underlying students' perceptions, showing how formal order-theoretic coherence coexists with principled failures of endpoint-freeness and density in finite empirical models.",

However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.",

In this paper, we explore the problem of constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \\emph{NeuS} and its variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally, we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark datasets.",

However, the single-centroid assumption can oversimplify the bona fide speech representation and overlook useful cues, such as speech quality, which reflects the naturalness of the speech. Speech quality can be easily obtained using existing speech quality assessment models that estimate it through Mean Opinion Score. In this paper, we propose QAMO: Quality-Aware Multi-Centroid One-Class Learning for speech deepfake detection. QAMO extends conventional one-class learning by introducing multiple quality-aware centroids. In QAMO, each centroid is optimized to represent a distinct speech quality subspaces, enabling better modeling of intra-class variability in bona fide speech. In addition, QAMO supports a multi-centroid ensemble scoring strategy, which improves decision thresholding and reduces the need for quality labels during inference. With two centroids to represent high- and low-quality speech, our proposed QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% in In-the-Wild dataset, outperforming previous one-class and quality-aware systems.",

This paper presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate (SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution (JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training. The system has been deployed in multiple AI data center clusters, where it stably supports large-scale intelligent computing workloads. This work provides a practical engineering approach for building high-performance, highly available, AI-native scheduling infrastructure.",

Systems that integrate both modes, common in robotic surgery or driving assistance, often overlook shifts in user preferences within a task in response to factors like evolving trust, decision complexity, and perceived control. In this work, we investigate how users dynamically switch between higher and lower levels of control during a sequential decision-making task. Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece and the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and the participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400 mode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional state, and subtask difficulty data. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in gaze patterns and subtask complexity prior to a switch and in the quality of the subsequent move. Based on these results, we engineered behavioral and task-specific features to train a lightweight model that predicted control level switches ($F1 = 0.65$). The model performance suggests that real-time behavioral signals can serve as a complementary input alongside system-driven mode-switching mechanisms currently used. We complement our quantitative results with qualitative factors that influence switching including perceived AI ability, decision complexity, and level of control, identified from post-game interview analysis. The combined behavioral and modeling insights can help inform the design of shared autonomy systems that need dynamic, subtask-level control switches aligned with user intent and evolving task demands.",

    "abstract": "Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, run models, then iterate. We ask a question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments to inform earlier study design? For example, a team building an AI assistant for a certain task can estimate whether expected performance is around 50 or closer to 80, evidence that supports whether to proceed to a pilot study, how to scope it, and how to allocate resources. We study text-only performance forecasting, where a model predicts a score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. We scrape task and configuration descriptions from arXiv, yielding 2,290 instances covering 1,519 papers, and construct a leakage free test split using papers published after the knowledge cutoff of the evaluated models. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: reasoning models achieve moderate prediction performance with well calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 9.9 at high confidence thresholds. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT5 with built in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.",

    "abstract": "Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability, real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability, decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.",

    "abstract": "A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation of cell",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability, multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.\n  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.",

    "abstract": "Studying peer effects in language is critical because they often reflect behavioral and personality traits that are important determinants of economic outcomes. However, language is unstructured, non-numeric, and high-dimensional. We combine Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings with structural econometric identification to provide a unified framework for identifying peer effects in language. This unified framework is applied to 80,000-120,000 written exchanges among residents of low security correctional facilities. The LLM language profiles predict three-year recidivism 30\\% more accurately than pre-entry covariates alone, showing that text representations capture meaningful signals. We analyze peer effects on multidimensional language embeddings while addressing network endogeneity. We develop novel instrumental variable estimators for peer effects that accommodate multivariate outcomes, sparse networks, and multidimensional latent variables. Our methods achieve root-N consistency and asymptotic normality under realistic sparsity conditions, relaxing the dense-network assumption. Results reveal significant peer effects in residents' language profiles.",

These factors hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site, decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets.",

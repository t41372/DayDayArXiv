The most popular of these are the independent\ncascade and linear threshold models.

Moreover, in many\nresearch tasks, these simulations are the most computationally intensive task,\nso it would be desirable to have a library for these with an interface to a\nhigh-level language with the performance of a low-level language.

      "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) frameworks play a critical role in advancing artificial\nintelligence, and their rapid growth underscores the need for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of software quality and maintainability. DL frameworks, like\nother systems, are prone to code clones. Code clones refer to identical or\nhighly similar source code fragments within the same project or even across\ndifferent projects. Code cloning can have positive and negative implications\nfor software development, influencing maintenance, readability, and bug\npropagation. In this paper, we aim to address the knowledge gap concerning the\nevolutionary dimension of code clones in DL frameworks and the extent of code\nreuse across these frameworks. We empirically analyze code clones in nine\npopular DL frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow, Paddle, PyTorch, Aesara, Ray, MXNet,\nKeras, Jax and BentoML, to investigate (1) the characteristics of the long-term\ncode cloning evolution over releases in each framework, (2) the short-term,\ni.e., within-release, code cloning patterns and their influence on the\nlong-term trends, and (3) the file-level code clones within the DL frameworks.\nOur findings reveal that DL frameworks adopt four distinct cloning trends and\nthat these trends present some common and distinct characteristics. For\ninstance, bug-fixing activities persistently happen in clones irrespective of\nthe clone evolutionary trend but occur more in the \"Serpentine\" trend.\nMoreover, the within release level investigation demonstrates that short-term\ncode cloning practices impact long-term cloning trends. The cross-framework\ncode clone investigation reveals the presence of functional and architectural\nadaptation file-level cross-framework code clones across the nine studied\nframeworks. We provide insights that foster robust clone practices and\ncollaborative maintenance in the development of DL frameworks.",

Photochromic color-changing systems, on the other hand,\nallow for the reprogramming of surface texture of 3D models, enabling easy\ncustomization of physical objects and opening up the possibility of using\nobject surfaces for data display. However, existing photochromic systems\nrequire the user to manually design the desired texture, inspect the simulation\nof the pattern on the object, and verify the efficacy of the generated pattern.\nThese manual design, inspection, and verification steps prevent the user from\nefficiently exploring the design space of possible patterns. Thus, by designing\nan automated workflow desired for an end-to-end texture application process, we\ncan allow rapid iteration on different practicable patterns.\n  In this workshop paper, we discuss the possibilities of extending generative\nAI systems, with material and design constraints for reprogrammable surfaces\nwith photochromic materials. By constraining generative AI systems to colors\nand materials possible to be physically realized with photochromic dyes, we can\ncreate tools that would allow users to explore different viable patterns, with\ntext and image-based prompts. We identify two focus areas in this topic:\nphotochromic material constraints and design constraints for data-encoded\ntextures. We highlight the current limitations of using generative AI tools to\ncreate viable textures using photochromic material.

      "abstract": "When faced with accomplishing a task, human experts exhibit intentional\nbehavior. Their unique intents shape their plans and decisions, resulting in\nexperts demonstrating diverse behaviors to accomplish the same task. Due to the\nuncertainties encountered in the real world and their bounded rationality,\nexperts sometimes adjust their intents, which in turn influences their\nbehaviors during task execution. This paper introduces IDIL, a novel imitation\nlearning algorithm to mimic these diverse intent-driven behaviors of experts.\nIteratively, our approach estimates expert intent from heterogeneous\ndemonstrations and then uses it to learn an intent-aware model of their\nbehavior. Unlike contemporary approaches, IDIL is capable of addressing\nsequential tasks with high-dimensional state representations, while\nsidestepping the complexities and drawbacks associated with adversarial\ntraining (a mainstay of related techniques). Our empirical results suggest that\nthe models generated by IDIL either match or surpass those produced by recent\nimitation learning benchmarks in metrics of task performance. Moreover, as it\ncreates a generative model, IDIL demonstrates superior performance in intent\ninference metrics, crucial for human-agent interactions, and aptly captures a\nbroad spectrum of expert behaviors.",

GTPM shows significantly better classification\nperformance for binary and multi-class datasets than well-known algorithms.\nAdditionally, the proposed method demonstrates superior robustness, maintaining\nperformance with limited (only $10\\%$) training data, showing an $8\\%$ decline\ncompared to $15-20\\%$ for baseline methods.",

Recent works have focused\non designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate\nthresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD\nsamples are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to\nachieve a desired true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95\\%$ TPR. However, this can\nlead to very high false positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96\\%, as\nobserved in the Open-OOD benchmark. In safety-critical real-life applications,\ne.g., medical diagnosis, controlling the FPR is essential when dealing with\nvarious OOD samples dynamically. To address these challenges, we propose a\nmathematically grounded OOD detection framework that leverages expert feedback\nto \\emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide theoretical\nresults showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at all times\nwhile minimizing the use of human feedback.

To tackle the first\nchallenge, we develop HATO, a low-cost hands-arms teleoperation system that\nleverages off-the-shelf electronics, complemented with a software suite that\nenables efficient data collection; the comprehensive software suite also\nsupports multimodal data processing, scalable policy learning, and smooth\npolicy deployment. To tackle the latter challenge, we introduce a novel\nhardware adaptation by repurposing two prosthetic hands equipped with touch\nsensors for research. Using visuotactile data collected from our system, we\nlearn skills to complete long-horizon, high-precision tasks which are difficult\nto achieve without multifingered dexterity and touch feedback. Furthermore, we\nempirically investigate the effects of dataset size, sensing modality, and\nvisual input preprocessing on policy learning.

      "abstract": "While many contemporary large language models (LLMs) can process lengthy\ninput, they still struggle to fully utilize information within the long\ncontext, known as the lost-in-the-middle challenge. We hypothesize that it\nstems from insufficient explicit supervision during the long-context training,\nwhich fails to emphasize that any position in a long context can hold crucial\ninformation. Based on this intuition, our study presents information-intensive\n(IN2) training, a purely data-driven solution to overcome lost-in-the-middle.\nSpecifically, IN2 training leverages a synthesized long-context question-answer\ndataset, where the answer requires (1) fine-grained information awareness on a\nshort segment (~128 tokens) within a synthesized long context (4K-32K tokens),\nand (2) the integration and reasoning of information from two or more short\nsegments. Through applying this information-intensive training on Mistral-7B,\nwe present FILM-7B (FILl-in-the-Middle). To thoroughly assess the ability of\nFILM-7B for utilizing long contexts, we design three probing tasks that\nencompass various context styles (document, code, and structured-data context)\nand information retrieval patterns (forward, backward, and bi-directional\nretrieval). The probing results demonstrate that FILM-7B can robustly retrieve\ninformation from different positions in its 32K context window. Beyond these\nprobing tasks, FILM-7B significantly improves the performance on real-world\nlong-context tasks (e.g., 23.5->26.9 F1 score on NarrativeQA), while\nmaintaining a comparable performance on short-context tasks (e.g., 59.3->59.2\naccuracy on MMLU).

Building upon this,\nrecent studies, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, have proposed the use of prompt\nlearning, where context within a prompt is replaced with learnable vectors,\nleading to significant improvements over manually crafted prompts. However, the\nperformance improvement for unseen classes is still marginal, and to tackle\nthis problem, data augmentation has been frequently used in traditional\nzero-shot learning techniques. Through our experiments, we have identified\nimportant issues in CoOp and CoCoOp: the context learned through traditional\nimage augmentation is biased toward seen classes, negatively impacting\ngeneralization to unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose\nadversarial token embedding to disentangle low-level visual augmentation\nfeatures from high-level class information when inducing bias in learnable\nprompts. Through our novel mechanism called \"Adding Attributes to Prompt\nLearning\", AAPL, we guide the learnable context to effectively extract text\nfeatures by focusing on high-level features for unseen classes. We have\nconducted experiments across 11 datasets, and overall, AAPL shows favorable\nperformances compared to the existing methods in few-shot learning, zero-shot\nlearning, cross-dataset, and domain generalization tasks.",

Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often\nexperience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains --\na phenomenon known as \"catastrophic forgetting\". While extensively studied in\nthe continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the\nrealm of LLMs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the\ncurrent research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is\nstructured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of\ncontinually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical\ncontinuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from\ngeneral to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal\ncontinual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains\n(Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of\nmodern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP),\nand Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of\nevaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current\navailable data sources (Section 5).

ConsistentID comprises\ntwo key components: a multimodal facial prompt generator that combines facial\nfeatures, corresponding facial descriptions and the overall facial context to\nenhance precision in facial details, and an ID-preservation network optimized\nthrough the facial attention localization strategy, aimed at preserving ID\nconsistency in facial regions. Together, these components significantly enhance\nthe accuracy of ID preservation by introducing fine-grained multimodal ID\ninformation from facial regions. To facilitate training of ConsistentID, we\npresent a fine-grained portrait dataset, FGID, with over 500,000 facial images,\noffering greater diversity and comprehensiveness than existing public facial\ndatasets. % such as LAION-Face, CelebA, FFHQ, and SFHQ. Experimental results\nsubstantiate that our ConsistentID achieves exceptional precision and diversity\nin personalized facial generation, surpassing existing methods in the MyStyle\ndataset. Furthermore, while ConsistentID introduces more multimodal ID\ninformation, it maintains a fast inference speed during generation.",

Based on this crucial insight, and in\nresponse to the challenges posed by the costly and limited availability of\nnon-English data for SFT, we introduce a novel training-free alignment method\nnamed PreTTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the\nfoundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without\ntraining. Experiments on machine translation and part-of-speech tagging across\neight languages demonstrate the efficacy of PreTTY in cross-lingual settings.\nRemarkably, by initiating the decoding process with only one or two prior\ntokens, foundation LLMs can achieve performance comparable to their SFT\ncounterparts.

Four preregistered\nexperiments with 588 participants from the U.S. and 680 GPT-4 iterations\nrevealed a stronger tendency towards additive transformations in GPT-4 than in\nhumans. Human participants were less likely to use additive strategies when\nsubtraction was relatively more efficient than when addition and subtraction\nwere equally efficient. GPT-4 exhibited the opposite behavior, with a strong\naddition bias when subtraction was more efficient. In terms of valence of task\ninstruction, GPT-4's use of additive strategies increased when instructed to\n\"improve\" (positive) rather than \"edit\" (neutral). These findings demonstrate\nthat biases in human problem-solving are amplified in GPT-4, and that LLM\nbehavior differs from human efficiency-based strategies.

Classic learning\ntools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are\nsensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic\nassumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw\nmaterials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even\nadversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution\nshift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning\nframework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes.

We construct the assessment of\nchanges in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making\nthe proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised\ntechniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA.

Here, we consider a dynamic model where\ncommunication happens over a channel with variable latency and bandwidth\nconstraints. Leveraging recent works on conditional computation, we exploit the\nstructure of the transformer blocks and the multihead attention operator to\ndesign a trainable semantic token selection mechanism that learns to select\nrelevant tokens (e.g., image patches) from the input signal. This is done\ndynamically, on a per-input basis, with a rate that can be chosen as an\nadditional input by the user. We show that our model improves over\nstate-of-the-art token selection mechanisms, exhibiting high accuracy for a\nwide range of latency and bandwidth constraints, without the need for deploying\nmultiple architectures tailored to each constraint. Last, but not least, the\nproposed token selection mechanism helps extract powerful semantics that are\neasy to understand and explain, paving the way for interpretable-by-design\nmodels for the next generation of AI-native communication systems.",

However,\ntraditional manual design paradigm typically requires extensive domain\nknowledge and involves a labor-intensive trial-and-error process. This paper\nintroduces EvolCAF, a novel framework that integrates large language models\n(LLMs) with evolutionary computation (EC) to automatically design cost-aware\nAFs. Leveraging the crossover and mutation in the algorithmic space, EvolCAF\noffers a novel design paradigm, significantly reduces the reliance on domain\nexpertise and model training. The designed cost-aware AF maximizes the\nutilization of available information from historical data, surrogate models and\nbudget details. It introduces novel ideas not previously explored in the\nexisting literature on acquisition function design, allowing for clear\ninterpretations to provide insights into its behavior and decision-making\nprocess. In comparison to the well-known EIpu and EI-cool methods designed by\nhuman experts, our approach showcases remarkable efficiency and generalization\nacross various tasks, including 12 synthetic problems and 3 real-world\nhyperparameter tuning test sets.",

Once\nmalicious users induce high energy consumption and latency time (energy-latency\ncost), it will exhaust computational resources and harm availability of\nservice. In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability for MLLMs,\nparticularly image-based and video-based ones, and aim to induce high\nenergy-latency cost during inference by crafting an imperceptible perturbation.\nWe find that high energy-latency cost can be manipulated by maximizing the\nlength of generated sequences, which motivates us to propose verbose samples,\nincluding verbose images and videos. Concretely, two modality non-specific\nlosses are proposed, including a loss to delay end-of-sequence (EOS) token and\nan uncertainty loss to increase the uncertainty over each generated token. In\naddition, improving diversity is important to encourage longer responses by\nincreasing the complexity, which inspires the following modality specific loss.\nFor verbose images, a token diversity loss is proposed to promote diverse\nhidden states. For verbose videos, a frame feature diversity loss is proposed\nto increase the feature diversity among frames. To balance these losses, we\npropose a temporal weight adjustment algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that\nour verbose samples can largely extend the length of generated sequences.",

However, recent criticism has mounted against current xAI\nmethods that they disagree, are necessarily false, and can be manipulated,\nwhich has started to undermine the deployment of black-box models. Rudin (2019)\ngoes so far as to say that we should stop using black-box models altogether in\nhigh-stakes cases because xAI explanations \"must be wrong\". However, strict\nfidelity to the truth is historically not a desideratum in science.\nIdealizations -- the intentional distortions introduced to scientific theories\nand models -- are commonplace in the natural sciences and are seen as a\nsuccessful scientific tool. Thus, it is not falsehood qua falsehood that is the\nissue. In this paper, I outline the need for xAI research to engage in\nidealization evaluation. Drawing on the use of idealizations in the natural\nsciences and philosophy of science, I introduce a novel framework for\nevaluating whether xAI methods engage in successful idealizations or deceptive\nexplanations (SIDEs). SIDEs evaluates whether the limitations of xAI methods,\nand the distortions that they introduce, can be part of a successful\nidealization or are indeed deceptive distortions as critics suggest. I discuss\nthe role that existing research can play in idealization evaluation and where\ninnovation is necessary.

One of the goals of this study is to\nformulate the bandwidth and latency requirements for reliable real-time\ncommunication and to estimate their approximate values. This goal was achieved\nthrough simulation-based experiments involving docking maneuvers in the Bay of\nKiel, Germany. The final latency for the entire data processing pipeline was\nalso estimated during the real tests. In addition, a series of simulation-based\nexperiments showed the impact of key WebRTC features and demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the WebRTC protocol, while the conducted video codec\ncomparison showed that the hardware-accelerated H.264 codec is the best.\nFinally, the research addresses the topic of adaptive communication, where the\ntraditional congestion avoidance and deep reinforcement learning approaches\nwere analyzed.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various\nsectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as\ntext generation, summarization, and translation. Despite their widespread\nadoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information,\nexhibiting a tendency to hallucinate. This behavior can be attributed to\nseveral factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant\ncontributors. LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and\nengage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses. Moreover, they\nexhibit inconsistencies in their outputs. This paper aims to evaluate and\ncompare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and\nproprietary LLMs. The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground\ntruth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations. Queries\nfrom the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated\nresponses are evaluated against the ground truth answers. Additionally,\nexplanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities.\nConsistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models\nand observing for variations in their responses. For measuring reasoning\ncapabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth\nexplanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores. The findings\nreveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of\nboth consistency and reasoning capabilities. However, even when presented with\nbasic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\\%\nin both consistency and reasoning. This study underscores the direct\ncorrelation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights\nthe inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models.",

The\nobtained dual formulations turn out to be especially useful for imposing\nadditional constraints on the learned policy, as an intrinsic relationship\nbetween such dual constraints (or regularization terms) and reward\nmodifications in the primal is revealed. Furthermore, using this framework, we\nare able to introduce some novel types of constraints, allowing to impose\nbounds on the policy's action density or on costs associated with transitions\nbetween consecutive states and actions. From the adjusted primal-dual\noptimization problems, a practical algorithm is derived that supports various\ncombinations of policy constraints that are automatically handled throughout\ntraining using trainable reward modifications.

Some forms of DDs (e.g.,\nOBDDs, SDDs) are canonical, that is, (under given conditions on the atom list)\nthey univocally represent equivalence classes of formulas. Given the limited\nexpressiveness of propositional logic, a few attempts to leverage DDs to SMT\nlevel have been presented in the literature. Unfortunately, these techniques\nstill suffer from some limitations: most procedures are theory-specific; some\nproduce theory DDs (T-DDs) which do not univocally represent T-valid formulas\nor T-inconsistent formulas; none of these techniques provably produces\ntheory-canonical T-DDs, which (under given conditions on the T-atom list)\nunivocally represent T-equivalence classes of formulas. Also, these procedures\nare not easy to implement, and very few implementations are actually available.\nIn this paper, we present a novel very-general technique to leverage DDs to SMT\nlevel, which has several advantages: it is very easy to implement on top of an\nAllSMT solver and a DD package, which are used as blackboxes; it works for\nevery form of DDs and every theory, or combination thereof, supported by the\nAllSMT solver; it produces theory-canonical T-DDs if the propositional DD is\ncanonical.

      "abstract": "Object detection in autonomous driving consists in perceiving and locating\ninstances of objects in multi-dimensional data, such as images or lidar scans.\nVery recently, multiple works are proposing to evaluate object detectors by\nmeasuring their ability to detect the objects that are most likely to interfere\nwith the driving task. Detectors are then ranked according to their ability to\ndetect the most relevant objects, rather than the highest number of objects.\nHowever there is little evidence so far that the relevance of predicted object\nmay contribute to the safety and reliability improvement of the driving task.\nThis position paper elaborates on a strategy, together with partial results, to\ni) configure and deploy object detectors that successfully extract knowledge on\nobject relevance, and ii) use such knowledge to improve the trajectory planning\ntask. We show that, given an object detector, filtering objects based on their\nrelevance, in combination with the traditional confidence threshold, reduces\nthe risk of missing relevant objects, decreases the likelihood of dangerous\ntrajectories, and improves the quality of trajectories in general.",

We explore how to solve MAPF problems\nwhen each agent can move between any pair of possible locations as long as\ntraversing the line segment connecting them does not lead to a collision with\nthe obstacles. This is known as any-angle pathfinding. We present the first\noptimal any-angle multi-agent pathfinding algorithm.

The straightforward\ncombination of those, however, scales poorly since any-angle path finding\ninduces search trees with a very large branching factor. To mitigate this, we\nadapt two techniques from classical MAPF to the any-angle setting, namely\nDisjoint Splitting and Multi-Constraints. Experimental results on different\ncombinations of these techniques show they enable solving over 30% more\nproblems than the vanilla combination of CCBS and TO-AA-SIPP.

These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text\ntokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V,\nwe observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to\nunderstand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for\nopen-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: \"list items one by\none,\" which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on\nthe image following the alphanumeric orders of tags. By integrating our curated\ndataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip\nexisting MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our\nfinetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset,\neven in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly\nenhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs.\nPerhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are\nomitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of\n\"list items one by one\" as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens\nthe object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage.\nFinally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the\nworking mechanism of SoM.

      "abstract": "Unsupervised graph anomaly detection aims at identifying rare patterns that\ndeviate from the majority in a graph without the aid of labels, which is\nimportant for a variety of real-world applications. Recent advances have\nutilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations\nby aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the\nhypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with\ntheir neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph\nanomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn\nrepresentations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs,\nresulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection\nperformance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph\nanomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the\nadverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn\neffective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To\nbridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for\nGuarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD).\nSpecifically, G3AD introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation\nconstraints to guard the GNNs from inconsistent information encoding.\nFurthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from\nsolely reconstructing the observed data that contains anomalies. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed G3AD can outperform seventeen\nstate-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

This paper\nintroduces the VISLA (Variance and Invariance to Semantic and Lexical\nAlterations) benchmark, designed to evaluate the semantic and lexical\nunderstanding of language models. VISLA presents a 3-way semantic\n(in)equivalence task with a triplet of sentences associated with an image, to\nevaluate both vision-language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models\n(ULMs). An evaluation involving 34 VLMs and 20 ULMs reveals surprising\ndifficulties in distinguishing between lexical and semantic variations. Spatial\nsemantics encoded by language models also appear to be highly sensitive to\nlexical information. Notably, text encoders of VLMs demonstrate greater\nsensitivity to semantic and lexical variations than unimodal text encoders. Our\ncontributions include the unification of image-to-text and text-to-text\nretrieval tasks, an off-the-shelf evaluation without fine-tuning, and assessing\nLMs' semantic (in)variance in the presence of lexical alterations. The results\nhighlight strengths and weaknesses across diverse vision and unimodal language\nmodels, contributing to a deeper understanding of their capabilities. % VISLA\nenables a rigorous evaluation, shedding light on language models' capabilities\nin handling semantic and lexical nuances.

To address this issue, we propose a general approach named\nReZero to boost tree search operations for MCTS-based algorithms.

To\nfurther adapt to this design, we periodically reanalyze the entire buffer\ninstead of frequently reanalyzing the mini-batch.

The Learngene framework,\nintroduced recently, firstly learns one compact part termed as learngene from a\nlarge well-trained model, after which learngene is expanded to initialize\nvariable-sized models. In this paper, we start from analysing the importance of\nguidance for the expansion of well-trained learngene layers, inspiring the\ndesign of a simple but highly effective Learngene approach termed SWS\n(Stage-wise Weight Sharing), where both learngene layers and their learning\nprocess critically contribute to providing knowledge and guidance for\ninitializing models at varying scales. Specifically, to learn learngene layers,\nwe build an auxiliary model comprising multiple stages where the layer weights\nin each stage are shared, after which we train it through distillation.\nSubsequently, we expand these learngene layers containing stage information at\ntheir corresponding stage to initialize models of variable depths. Extensive\nexperiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that SWS achieves consistent better\nperformance compared to many models trained from scratch, while reducing around\n6.6x total training costs. In some cases, SWS performs better only after 1\nepoch tuning. When initializing variable-sized models adapting for different\nresource constraints, SWS achieves better results while reducing around 20x\nparameters stored to initialize these models and around 10x pre-training costs,\nin contrast to the pre-training and fine-tuning approach.",

      "abstract": "Prompt learning has become the most effective paradigm for adapting large\npre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Recently,\nunsupervised prompt tuning methods, such as UPL and POUF, directly leverage\npseudo-labels as supervisory information to fine-tune additional adaptation\nmodules on unlabeled data. However, inaccurate pseudo labels easily misguide\nthe tuning process and result in poor representation capabilities. In light of\nthis, we propose Training-Free Unsupervised Prompts (TFUP), which maximally\npreserves the inherent representation capabilities and enhances them with a\nresidual connection to similarity-based prediction probabilities in a\ntraining-free and labeling-free manner. Specifically, we integrate both\ninstance confidence and prototype scores to select representative samples,\nwhich are used to customize a reliable Feature Cache Model (FCM) for\ntraining-free inference. Then, we design a Multi-level Similarity Measure (MSM)\nthat considers both feature-level and semantic-level similarities to calculate\nthe distance between each test image and the cached sample as the weight of the\ncorresponding cached label to generate similarity-based prediction\nprobabilities. In this way, TFUP achieves surprising performance, even\nsurpassing the training-base method on multiple classification datasets. Based\non our TFUP, we propose a training-based approach (TFUP-T) to further boost the\nadaptation performance. In addition to the standard cross-entropy loss, TFUP-T\nadopts an additional marginal distribution entropy loss to constrain the model\nfrom a global perspective. Our TFUP-T achieves new state-of-the-art\nclassification performance compared to unsupervised and few-shot adaptation\napproaches on multiple benchmarks. In particular, TFUP-T improves the\nclassification accuracy of POUF by 3.3% on the most challenging Domain-Net\ndataset.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged as another important\naudience for programming languages alongside humans and machines, as we enter\nthe era of large language models (LLMs). LLMs can now perform well in coding\ncompetitions and even write programs like developers to solve various tasks,\nincluding mathematical problems. However, the grammar and layout of current\nprograms are designed to cater the needs of human developers -- with many\ngrammar tokens and formatting tokens being used to make the code easier for\nhumans to read. While this is helpful, such a design adds unnecessary\ncomputational work for LLMs, as each token they either use or produce consumes\ncomputational resources. To improve inference efficiency and reduce\ncomputational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar. This aims\nto represent code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI\nmodels. Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a\nminimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively. To demonstrate\nthe feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented\ngrammar for Python, named SimPy. SimPy is crafted by revising the original\nPython grammar through a series of heuristic rules. Programs written in SimPy\nmaintain identical AST structures to those in standard Python. This allows for\nnot only execution via a modified AST parser, but also seamless transformation\nbetween programs written in Python and SimPy, enabling human developers and\nLLMs to use Python and SimPy, respectively, when they need to collaborate. In\nthe experiments, compared with Python, SimPy enables a reduction in token usage\nby 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, respectively, when completing the\nsame set of code-related tasks. Additionally, these models can maintain or even\nimprove their performance when using SimPy instead of Python for these tasks.",

This paper\nfirst empirically finds that 1) the vanilla MWA can benefit the\nclass-imbalanced learning, and 2) performing model averaging in the early\nepochs of training yields a greater performance improvement than doing that in\nlater epochs. Inspired by these two observations, in this paper we propose a\nnovel MWA technique for class-imbalanced learning tasks named Iterative Model\nWeight Averaging (IMWA). Specifically, IMWA divides the entire training stage\ninto multiple episodes. Within each episode, multiple models are concurrently\ntrained from the same initialized model weight, and subsequently averaged into\na singular model. Then, the weight of this average model serves as a fresh\ninitialization for the ensuing episode, thus establishing an iterative learning\nparadigm. Compared to vanilla MWA, IMWA achieves higher performance\nimprovements with the same computational cost. Moreover, IMWA can further\nenhance the performance of those methods employing EMA strategy, demonstrating\nthat IMWA and EMA can complement each other. Extensive experiments on various\nclass-imbalanced learning tasks, i.e., class-imbalanced image classification,\nsemi-supervised class-imbalanced image classification and semi-supervised\nobject detection tasks showcase the effectiveness of our IMWA.",

It presents an experimental case study that enhances\ncybersecurity in EVCI using TinyML, evaluated against traditional ML in terms\nof reduced delay and memory usage, with a slight trade-off in accuracy.\nAdditionally, the study includes a practical setup using the ESP32\nmicrocontroller in the PlatformIO environment, which provides a hands-on\nassessment of TinyML's application in cybersecurity for EVCI.",

      "abstract": "Complex single-objective bounded problems are often difficult to solve. In\nevolutionary computation methods, since the proposal of differential evolution\nalgorithm in 1997, it has been widely studied and developed due to its\nsimplicity and efficiency. These developments include various adaptive\nstrategies, operator improvements, and the introduction of other search\nmethods. After 2014, research based on LSHADE has also been widely studied by\nresearchers. However, although recently proposed improvement strategies have\nshown superiority over their previous generation's first performance, adding\nall new strategies may not necessarily bring the strongest performance.\nTherefore, we recombine some effective advances based on advanced differential\nevolution variants in recent years and finally determine an effective\ncombination scheme to further promote the performance of differential\nevolution. In this paper, we propose a strategy recombination and\nreconstruction differential evolution algorithm called reconstructed\ndifferential evolution (RDE) to solve single-objective bounded optimization\nproblems. Based on the benchmark suite of the 2024 IEEE Congress on\nEvolutionary Computation (CEC2024), we tested RDE and several other advanced\ndifferential evolution variants. The experimental results show that RDE has\nsuperior performance in solving complex optimization problems.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to pedagogies like evidence-based teaching, personalized adaptive\nlearning (PAL) distinguishes itself by closely monitoring the progress of\nindividual students and tailoring the learning path to their unique knowledge\nand requirements. A crucial technique for effective PAL implementation is\nknowledge tracing, which models students' evolving knowledge to predict their\nfuture performance. Based on these predictions, personalized recommendations\nfor resources and learning paths can be made to meet individual needs. Recent\nadvancements in deep learning have successfully enhanced knowledge tracking\nthrough Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). This paper introduces generative AI\nmodels to further enhance DKT. Generative AI models, rooted in deep learning,\nare trained to generate synthetic data, addressing data scarcity challenges in\nvarious applications across fields such as natural language processing (NLP)\nand computer vision (CV). This study aims to tackle data shortage issues in\nstudent learning records to enhance DKT performance for PAL. Specifically, it\nemploys TabDDPM, a diffusion model, to generate synthetic educational records\nto augment training data for enhancing DKT. The proposed method's effectiveness\nis validated through extensive experiments on ASSISTments datasets. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the AI-generated data by TabDDPM\nsignificantly improves DKT performance, particularly in scenarios with small\ndata for training and large data for testing.",

We show the value of each feature through ablation studies, and\nshow the effectiveness of a unified model compared to standalone counterparts.\nFinally, we share how these embeddings have been deployed across the Pinterest\nsearch stack, from retrieval to ranking, scaling to serve $300k$ requests per\nsecond at low latency.

      "abstract": "Translating major language resources to build minor language resources\nbecomes a widely-used approach. Particularly in translating complex data points\ncomposed of multiple components, it is common to translate each component\nseparately. However, we argue that this practice often overlooks the\ninterrelation between components within the same data point. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel MT pipeline that considers the intra-data\nrelation in implementing MT for training data. In our MT pipeline, all the\ncomponents in a data point are concatenated to form a single translation\nsequence and subsequently reconstructed to the data components after\ntranslation. We introduce a Catalyst Statement (CS) to enhance the intra-data\nrelation, and Indicator Token (IT) to assist the decomposition of a translated\nsequence into its respective data components. Through our approach, we have\nachieved a considerable improvement in translation quality itself, along with\nits effectiveness as training data. Compared with the conventional approach\nthat translates each data component separately, our method yields better\ntraining data that enhances the performance of the trained model by 2.690\npoints for the web page ranking (WPR) task, and 0.845 for the question\ngeneration (QG) task in the XGLUE benchmark.",

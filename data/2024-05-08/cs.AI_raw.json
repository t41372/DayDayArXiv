We use a meticulously selected mix of audio features which provide\nthe salient attributes of the data and allow for accurate classification. The\nextracted features are then used as an input to two separate model classifiers\n1) a multi-feature CNN classifier and 2) an XGBoost Classifier. The outputs of\nthe two models are then fused with the use of soft voting. Thus, by exploiting\nensemble learning, we achieve increased robustness and accuracy. We evaluate\nthe performance of the model on a database of 920 respiratory sounds, which\nundergoes data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the data\nand generalizability of the model. We empirically verify that AFEN sets a new\nstate-of-the-art using Precision and Recall as metrics, while decreasing\ntraining time by 60%.",

To address this challenge, we present Vidur - a large-scale,\nhigh-fidelity, easily-extensible simulation framework for LLM inference\nperformance. Vidur models the performance of LLM operators using a combination\nof experimental profiling and predictive modeling, and evaluates the end-to-end\ninference performance for different workloads by estimating several metrics of\ninterest such as latency and throughput. We validate the fidelity of Vidur on\nseveral LLMs and show that it estimates inference latency with less than 9%\nerror across the range. Further, we present Vidur-Search, a configuration\nsearch tool that helps optimize LLM deployment. Vidur-Search uses Vidur to\nautomatically identify the most cost-effective deployment configuration that\nmeets application performance constraints. For example, Vidur-Search finds the\nbest deployment configuration for LLaMA2-70B in one hour on a CPU machine, in\ncontrast to a deployment-based exploration which would require 42K GPU hours -\ncosting ~218K dollars.

Therefore, the\ngradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage\nand thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering.\nThanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels\nare needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\\sim\n1000\\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via\nsolving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity.

Nevertheless, since real-world\nevaluation costs afford users only a small number of policy rollouts, it\nremains a challenge to accurately gauge the performance of such policies. This\nis exacerbated by distribution shifts causing unpredictable changes in\nperformance during deployment. To rigorously evaluate behavior cloning\npolicies, we present a framework that provides a tight lower-bound on robot\nperformance in an arbitrary environment, using a minimal number of experimental\npolicy rollouts. Notably, by applying the standard stochastic ordering to robot\nperformance distributions, we provide a worst-case bound on the entire\ndistribution of performance (via bounds on the cumulative distribution\nfunction) for a given task. We build upon established statistical results to\nensure that the bounds hold with a user-specified confidence level and\ntightness, and are constructed from as few policy rollouts as possible. In\nexperiments we evaluate policies for visuomotor manipulation in both simulation\nand hardware. Specifically, we (i) empirically validate the guarantees of the\nbounds in simulated manipulation settings, (ii) find the degree to which a\nlearned policy deployed on hardware generalizes to new real-world environments,\nand (iii) rigorously compare two policies tested in out-of-distribution\nsettings.

With the emergence of generative AI, phishing attacks\ncan be based on emails generated automatically, making it more difficult to\ndetect them. That is, instead of a single email format sent to a large number\nof recipients, generative AI can be used to send each potential victim a\ndifferent email, making it more difficult for cybersecurity systems to identify\nthe scam email before it reaches the recipient. Here we describe a corpus of\nAI-generated phishing emails. We also use different machine learning tools to\ntest the ability of automatic text analysis to identify AI-generated phishing\nemails. The results are encouraging, and show that machine learning tools can\nidentify an AI-generated phishing email with high accuracy compared to regular\nemails or human-generated scam email. By applying descriptive analytic, the\nspecific differences between AI-generated emails and manually crafted scam\nemails are profiled, and show that AI-generated emails are different in their\nstyle from human-generated phishing email scams. Therefore, automatic\nidentification tools can be used as a warning for the user. The paper also\ndescribes the corpus of AI-generated phishing emails that is made open to the\npublic, and can be used for consequent studies. While the ability of machine\nlearning to detect AI-generated phishing email is encouraging, AI-generated\nphishing emails are different from regular phishing emails, and therefore it is\nimportant to train machine learning systems also with AI-generated emails in\norder to repel future phishing attacks that are powered by generative AI.",

    "abstract": "Syntax-guided synthesis is commonly used to generate programs encoding\npolicies. In this approach, the set of programs, that can be written in a\ndomain-specific language defines the search space, and an algorithm searches\nwithin this space for programs that encode strong policies. In this paper, we\npropose an alternative method for synthesizing programmatic policies, where we\nsearch within an approximation of the language's semantic space. We\nhypothesized that searching in semantic spaces is more sample-efficient\ncompared to syntax-based spaces. Our rationale is that the search is more\nefficient if the algorithm evaluates different agent behaviors as it searches\nthrough the space, a feature often missing in syntax-based spaces. This is\nbecause small changes in the syntax of a program often do not result in\ndifferent agent behaviors. We define semantic spaces by learning a library of\nprograms that present different agent behaviors. Then, we approximate the\nsemantic space by defining a neighborhood function for local search algorithms,\nwhere we replace parts of the current candidate program with programs from the\nlibrary. We evaluated our hypothesis in a real-time strategy game called\nMicroRTS. Empirical results support our hypothesis that searching in semantic\nspaces can be more sample-efficient than searching in syntax-based spaces.",

Two\nthirds of OMI cases are difficult to visually identify from a 12-lead\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) and can be potentially fatal if not identified in a\ntimely fashion. Previous works on this topic are scarce, and current\nstate-of-the-art evidence suggests that both random forests with engineered\nfeatures and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising approaches to\nimprove the ECG detection of OMI.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an integral part of modern\nsocieties, powering user-facing applications such as personal assistants and\nenterprise applications like recruitment tools. Despite their utility, research\nindicates that LLMs perpetuate systemic biases. Yet, prior works on LLM harms\npredominantly focus on Western concepts like race and gender, often overlooking\ncultural concepts from other parts of the world. Additionally, these studies\ntypically investigate \"harm\" as a singular dimension, ignoring the various and\nsubtle forms in which harms manifest. To address this gap, we introduce the\nCovert Harms and Social Threats (CHAST), a set of seven metrics grounded in\nsocial science literature. We utilize evaluation models aligned with human\nassessments to examine the presence of covert harms in LLM-generated\nconversations, particularly in the context of recruitment. Our experiments\nreveal that seven out of the eight LLMs included in this study generated\nconversations riddled with CHAST, characterized by malign views expressed in\nseemingly neutral language unlikely to be detected by existing methods.\nNotably, these LLMs manifested more extreme views and opinions when dealing\nwith non-Western concepts like caste, compared to Western ones such as race.",

    "abstract": "Offline optimization is an emerging problem in many experimental engineering\ndomains including protein, drug or aircraft design, where online\nexperimentation to collect evaluation data is too expensive or dangerous. To\navoid that, one has to optimize an unknown function given only its offline\nevaluation at a fixed set of inputs. A naive solution to this problem is to\nlearn a surrogate model of the unknown function and optimize this surrogate\ninstead. However, such a naive optimizer is prone to erroneous overestimation\nof the surrogate (possibly due to over-fitting on a biased sample of function\nevaluation) on inputs outside the offline dataset. Prior approaches addressing\nthis challenge have primarily focused on learning robust surrogate models.\nHowever, their search strategies are derived from the surrogate model rather\nthan the actual offline data. To fill this important gap, we introduce a new\nlearning-to-search perspective for offline optimization by reformulating it as\nan offline reinforcement learning problem. Our proposed policy-guided gradient\nsearch approach explicitly learns the best policy for a given surrogate model\ncreated from the offline data. Our empirical results on multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that the learned optimization policy can be combined with existing\noffline surrogates to significantly improve the optimization performance.",

Some recent studies propose adversarial attacks to investigate the\nvulnerabilities of KGE methods, but their attackers are target-oriented with\nthe KGE method and the target triples to predict are given in advance, which\nlacks practicability. In this work, we explore untargeted attacks with the aim\nof reducing the global performances of KGE methods over a set of unknown test\ntriples and conducting systematic analyses on KGE robustness. Considering logic\nrules can effectively summarize the global structure of a KG, we develop\nrule-based attack strategies to enhance the attack efficiency. In particular,we\nconsider adversarial deletion which learns rules, applying the rules to score\ntriple importance and delete important triples, and adversarial addition which\ncorrupts the learned rules and applies them for negative triples as\nperturbations. Extensive experiments on two datasets over three representative\nclasses of KGE methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed untargeted\nattacks in diminishing the link prediction results. And we also find that\ndifferent KGE methods exhibit different robustness to untargeted attacks.

In this work, we propose an efficient\nparallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase. The key\nobservation is that the extension phase generates tokens faster than the prompt\nphase because of key-value cache (KV-cache). Hence, KV-Runahead parallelizes\nthe prompt phase by orchestrating multiple processes to populate the KV-cache\nand minimizes the time-to-first-token (TTFT). Dual-purposing the KV-cache\nscheme has two main benefits. First, since KV-cache is designed to leverage the\ncausal attention map, we minimize computation and computation automatically.\nSecond, since it already exists for the extension phase, KV-Runahead is easy to\nimplement. We further propose context-level load-balancing to handle uneven\nKV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT.\nCompared with an existing parallelization scheme such as tensor or sequential\nparallelization where keys and values are locally generated and exchanged via\nall-gather collectives, our experimental results demonstrate that KV-Runahead\ncan offer over 1.4x and 1.6x speedups for Llama 7B and Falcon 7B respectively.",

Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended\nfree-form responses, which we term \"Type I hallucinations\". Instead, they focus\non hallucinations responding to very specific question formats -- typically a\nmultiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute -- which we\nterm \"Type II hallucinations\". Additionally, such benchmarks often require\nexternal API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we\nobserve that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction\nin Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of hallucinations are\noften anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based\nautomatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM\nfree-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify\nhallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating\na large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an\nimprovement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I\nhallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I\nhallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data\naugmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong\nbaseline.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Models (DMs) have exhibited superior performance in generating\nhigh-quality and diverse images. However, this exceptional performance comes at\nthe cost of expensive architectural design, particularly due to the attention\nmodule heavily used in leading models. Existing works mainly adopt a retraining\nprocess to enhance DM efficiency. This is computationally expensive and not\nvery scalable. To this end, we introduce the Attention-driven Training-free\nEfficient Diffusion Model (AT-EDM) framework that leverages attention maps to\nperform run-time pruning of redundant tokens, without the need for any\nretraining. Specifically, for single-denoising-step pruning, we develop a novel\nranking algorithm, Generalized Weighted Page Rank (G-WPR), to identify\nredundant tokens, and a similarity-based recovery method to restore tokens for\nthe convolution operation. In addition, we propose a Denoising-Steps-Aware\nPruning (DSAP) approach to adjust the pruning budget across different denoising\ntimesteps for better generation quality. Extensive evaluations show that AT-EDM\nperforms favorably against prior art in terms of efficiency (e.g., 38.8% FLOPs\nsaving and up to 1.53x speed-up over Stable Diffusion XL) while maintaining\nnearly the same FID and CLIP scores as the full model.

However, the quadratic computational cost\n$O(n^2)$ in the input sequence length $n$ is a notorious obstacle for further\nimprovement and scalability in longer contexts. In this work, we leverage the\nconvolution-like structure of attention matrices to develop an efficient\napproximation method for attention computation using convolution matrices. We\npropose a $\\mathsf{conv}$ basis system, analogous to the rank basis, and show\nthat any lower triangular matrix can always be decomposed as a sum of\nstructured convolution matrices in this basis. We then design a fast algorithm\nto approximate the attention matrix via a sum of such $k$ convolution matrices.\nThis allows us to compute the attention {\\it inference} via Fast Fourier\nTransforms (FFT) in $O(knd \\log n)$ time, where $d$ is the hidden dimension,\nand thus achieve almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$ in the practical scenario\nwhere $kd = n^{o(1)}$. Furthermore, the attention {\\it training forward} and\n{\\it backward gradient} can be computed in $n^{1+o(1)}$ as well. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the run time and approximation error and conduct\npreliminary experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. We hope our new paradigm\nfor accelerating attention computation in transformer models can help their\napplication to longer contexts.",

    "abstract": "We study the task of conducting structured reasoning as generating a\nreasoning graph from natural language input using large language models (LLMs).\nPrevious approaches have explored various prompting schemes, yet they suffer\nfrom error propagation due to the autoregressive nature and single-pass-based\ndecoding, which lack error correction capability. Additionally, relying solely\non a single sample may result in the omission of true nodes and edges. To\ncounter this, we draw inspiration from self-consistency (SC), which involves\nsampling a diverse set of reasoning chains and taking the majority vote as the\nfinal answer. To tackle the substantial challenge of applying SC on generated\ngraphs, we propose MIDGARD (MInimum Description length Guided Aggregation of\nReasoning in Directed acyclic graph) that leverages Minimum Description Length\n(MDL)-based formulation to identify consistent properties among the different\ngraph samples generated by an LLM. This formulation helps reject properties\nthat appear in only a few samples, which are likely to be erroneous, while\nenabling the inclusion of missing elements without compromising precision.

    "abstract": "In selective classification (SC), a classifier abstains from making\npredictions that are likely to be wrong to avoid excessive errors. To deploy\nimperfect classifiers -- either due to intrinsic statistical noise of data or\nfor robustness issue of the classifier or beyond -- in high-stakes scenarios,\nSC appears to be an attractive and necessary path to follow. Despite decades of\nresearch in SC, most previous SC methods still focus on the ideal statistical\nsetting only, i.e., the data distribution at deployment is the same as that of\ntraining, although practical data can come from the wild. To bridge this gap,\nin this paper, we propose an SC framework that takes into account distribution\nshifts, termed generalized selective classification, that covers label-shifted\n(or out-of-distribution) and covariate-shifted samples, in addition to typical\nin-distribution samples, the first of its kind in the SC literature. We focus\non non-training-based confidence-score functions for generalized SC on deep\nlearning (DL) classifiers, and propose two novel margin-based score functions.\nThrough extensive analysis and experiments, we show that our proposed score\nfunctions are more effective and reliable than the existing ones for\ngeneralized SC on a variety of classification tasks and DL classifiers.

Moreover, finding such features\nresults in a better evaluation of eSports players skills, which, besides\ncoaches, is of interest for game developers to design games automatically\nadaptable to the players expertise. Sensor data combined with machine learning\nhave already proved effective in classifying eSports players. However, the\nexisting methods do not provide sufficient information about features that\ndistinguish high-skilled players. In this paper, we propose an efficient method\nto find these features and then use them to classify players' skill levels. We\nfirst apply a time window to extract the players' sensor data, including heart\nrate, hand activities, etc., before and after game events in the League of\nLegends game. We use the extracted segments and symbolic transfer entropy to\ncalculate connectivity features between sensors. The most relevant features are\nthen selected using the newly developed consensus nested cross validation\nmethod. These features, representing the harmony between body parts, are\nfinally used to find the optimum window size and classify players' skills. The\nclassification results demonstrate a significant improvement by achieving 90.1%\naccuracy. Also, connectivity features between players gaze positions and\nkeyboard, mouse, and hand activities were the most distinguishing features in\nclassifying players' skills.

    "abstract": "Current autonomous driving systems heavily rely on V2X communication data to\nenhance situational awareness and the cooperation between vehicles. However, a\nmajor challenge when using V2X data is that it may not be available\nperiodically because of unpredictable delays and data loss during wireless\ntransmission between road stations and the receiver vehicle. This issue should\nbe considered when designing control strategies for connected and autonomous\nvehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel 'Blind Actor-Critic' algorithm\nthat guarantees robust driving performance in V2X environment with delayed\nand/or lost data. The novel algorithm incorporates three key mechanisms: a\nvirtual fixed sampling period, a combination of Temporal-Difference and Monte\nCarlo learning, and a numerical approximation of immediate reward values. To\naddress the temporal aperiodicity problem of V2X data, we first illustrate this\nchallenge. Then, we provide a detailed explanation of the Blind Actor-Critic\nalgorithm where we highlight the proposed components to compensate for the\ntemporal aperiodicity problem of V2X data. We evaluate the performance of our\nalgorithm in a simulation environment and compare it to benchmark approaches.\nThe results demonstrate that training metrics are improved compared to\nconventional actor-critic algorithms.

For AI agents to successfully interact in these\nsettings, however, achieving superhuman performance alone is not sufficient;\nthey also need to account for suboptimal actions or idiosyncratic style from\ntheir less-skilled counterparts. We propose a formal evaluation framework for\nassessing the compatibility of near-optimal AI with interaction partners who\nmay have much lower levels of skill; we use popular collaborative chess\nvariants as model systems to study and develop AI agents that can successfully\ninteract with lower-skill entities. Traditional chess engines designed to\noutput near-optimal moves prove to be inadequate partners when paired with\nengines of various lower skill levels in this domain, as they are not designed\nto consider the presence of other agents. We contribute three methodologies to\nexplicitly create skill-compatible AI agents in complex decision-making\nsettings, and two chess game frameworks designed to foster collaboration\nbetween powerful AI agents and less-skilled partners. On these frameworks, our\nagents outperform state-of-the-art chess AI (based on AlphaZero) despite being\nweaker in conventional chess, demonstrating that skill-compatibility is a\ntangible trait that is qualitatively and measurably distinct from raw\nperformance.

In tackling this, Artificial\nintelligence (AI) systems have emerged as a promising approach to minimize the\nrisks faced. Given that the Harmonized System (HS) code is a crucial element\nfor an accurate customs declaration, we propose a novel multimodal HS code\nprediction approach using deep learning models exploiting both image and text\nfeatures obtained through the customs declaration combined with e-commerce\nplatform information. We evaluated two early fusion methods and introduced our\nMultConcat fusion method. To the best of our knowledge, few studies analyze the\nfeaturelevel combination of text and image in the state-of-the-art for HS code\nprediction, which heightens interest in our paper and its findings.

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating a Health Index (HI) from condition monitoring data (CM)\nis essential for reliable and interpretable prognostics and health management\n(PHM) in complex systems. In most scenarios, complex systems operate under\nvarying operating conditions and can exhibit different fault modes, making\nunsupervised inference of an HI from CM data a significant challenge. Hybrid\nmodels combining prior knowledge about degradation with deep learning models\nhave been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previously suggested\nhybrid models for HI estimation usually rely heavily on system-specific\ninformation, limiting their transferability to other systems. In this work, we\npropose an unsupervised hybrid method for HI estimation that integrates general\nknowledge about degradation into the convolutional autoencoder's model\narchitecture and learning algorithm, enhancing its applicability across various\nsystems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in two case\nstudies from different domains: turbofan engines and lithium batteries. The\nresults show that the proposed method outperforms other competitive\nalternatives, including residual-based methods, in terms of HI quality and\ntheir utility for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions. The case studies\nalso highlight the comparable performance of our proposed method with a\nsupervised model trained with HI labels.",

Current DPM-related methods for lesion detection in medical\nimaging, which can be categorized into two distinct approaches, primarily rely\non image-level annotations. The first approach, based on anomaly detection,\ninvolves learning reference healthy brain representations and identifying\nanomalies based on the difference in inference results. In contrast, the second\napproach, resembling a segmentation task, employs only the original brain\nmulti-modalities as prior information for generating pixel-level annotations.\nIn this paper, our proposed model - discrepancy distribution medical diffusion\n(DDMD) - for lesion detection in brain MRI introduces a novel framework by\nincorporating distinctive discrepancy features, deviating from the conventional\ndirect reliance on image-level annotations or the original brain modalities. In\nour method, the inconsistency in image-level annotations is translated into\ndistribution discrepancies among heterogeneous samples while preserving\ninformation within homogeneous samples. This property retains pixel-wise\nuncertainty and facilitates an implicit ensemble of segmentation, ultimately\nenhancing the overall detection performance.

Traditional explanation mechanisms from the\nfield of Counterfactual Thinking are a widely-used paradigm for Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI), as they follow a natural way of reasoning that\nhumans are familiar with. However, most common approaches from this field are\nbased on communicating information about features or characteristics that are\nespecially important for an AI's decision. However, to fully understand a\ndecision, not only knowledge about relevant features is needed, but the\nawareness of irrelevant information also highly contributes to the creation of\na user's mental model of an AI system. To this end, a novel approach for\nexplaining AI systems called alterfactual explanations was recently proposed on\na conceptual level. It is based on showing an alternative reality where\nirrelevant features of an AI's input are altered. By doing so, the user\ndirectly sees which input data characteristics can change arbitrarily without\ninfluencing the AI's decision. In this paper, we show for the first time that\nit is possible to apply this idea to black box models based on neural networks.\nTo this end, we present a GAN-based approach to generate these alterfactual\nexplanations for binary image classifiers.

Existing methods address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting by\nfreezing the feature extractor during novel-class learning. However, these\nmethods usually tend to cause the confusion between base and novel classes,\ni.e., classifying novel-class samples into base classes. In this paper, we\ndelve into this phenomenon to study its cause and solution. We first interpret\nthe confusion as the collision between the novel-class and the base-class\nregion in the feature space. Then, we find the collision is caused by the\nlabel-irrelevant redundancies within the base-class feature and pixel space.\nThrough qualitative and quantitative experiments, we identify this redundancy\nas the shortcut in the base-class training, which can be decoupled to alleviate\nthe collision. Based on this analysis, to alleviate the collision between base\nand novel classes, we propose a method for FSCIL named Redundancy Decoupling\nand Integration (RDI). RDI first decouples redundancies from base-class space\nto shrink the intra-base-class feature space. Then, it integrates the\nredundancies as a dummy class to enlarge the inter-base-class feature space.\nThis process effectively compresses the base-class feature space, creating\nbuffer space for novel classes and alleviating the model's confusion between\nthe base and novel classes. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets,\nincluding CIFAR-100, miniImageNet, and CUB-200-2011 demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the future trajectories of dynamic traffic actors is a cornerstone\ntask in autonomous driving. Though existing notable efforts have resulted in\nimpressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and\nunderstanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM,\nthe first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwithout explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents'\npast/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse\ncontext joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that\nLLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful\ncomprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and\ninteractive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function\nand enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware\nprobabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a\nmulti-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal\npredictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs'\nstrong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware\nprobability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation\nmetrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's\nperformance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority\nof benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores\nequipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in\nLLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent\nmotion in a new way.",

The rapid development of IoT devices allows us to collect different\nkinds of data with high correlations to traffic predictions, fostering the\ndevelopment of efficient multi-modal traffic prediction models. Until now,\nthere are few studies focusing on utilizing advantages of multi-modal data for\ntraffic predictions.

We conducted\nextensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model on traffic congestion and\ntaxi demand predictions using real-world datasets. The results showed the\nsuperiority of xMTrans against recent state-of-the-art methods on long-term\ntraffic predictions.

    "abstract": "Ownership verification is currently the most critical and widely adopted\npost-hoc method to safeguard model copyright. In general, model owners exploit\nit to identify whether a given suspicious third-party model is stolen from them\nby examining whether it has particular properties `inherited' from their\nreleased models. Currently, backdoor-based model watermarks are the primary and\ncutting-edge methods to implant such properties in the released models.\nHowever, backdoor-based methods have two fatal drawbacks, including harmfulness\nand ambiguity. The former indicates that they introduce maliciously\ncontrollable misclassification behaviors ($i.e.$, backdoor) to the watermarked\nreleased models. The latter denotes that malicious users can easily pass the\nverification by finding other misclassified samples, leading to ownership\nambiguity.\n  In this paper, we argue that both limitations stem from the `zero-bit' nature\nof existing watermarking schemes, where they exploit the status ($i.e.$,\nmisclassified) of predictions for verification. Motivated by this\nunderstanding, we design a new watermarking paradigm, $i.e.$, Explanation as a\nWatermark (EaaW), that implants verification behaviors into the explanation of\nfeature attribution instead of model predictions. Specifically, EaaW embeds a\n`multi-bit' watermark into the feature attribution explanation of specific\ntrigger samples without changing the original prediction. We correspondingly\ndesign the watermark embedding and extraction algorithms inspired by\nexplainable artificial intelligence. In particular, our approach can be used\nfor different tasks ($e.g.$, image classification and text generation).\nExtensive experiments verify the effectiveness and harmlessness of our EaaW and\nits resistance to potential attacks.",

With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as\na prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all\ntasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural\nlanguage (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end\nfinetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic\nforgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB)\n-- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \\method~uses a\nlearnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies.\nThis enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being\nentirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables\nend-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens\nlearned during pre-training.

This paper presents a case study of chain of\nthought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines\nthe performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of\nexamples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt.\nWhile our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance\nimprovements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly\nspecific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly\ndeteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of\nstacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains\ncommonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of\nsimilar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in\nthe literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model\nlearning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on\ncarefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights\ndrawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible\nperformance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples\nwith correct reasoning traces.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study semi-supervised graph classification, which aims at\naccurately predicting the categories of graphs in scenarios with limited\nlabeled graphs and abundant unlabeled graphs. Despite the promising capability\nof graph neural networks (GNNs), they typically require a large number of\ncostly labeled graphs, while a wealth of unlabeled graphs fail to be\neffectively utilized. Moreover, GNNs are inherently limited to encoding local\nneighborhood information using message-passing mechanisms, thus lacking the\nability to model higher-order dependencies among nodes. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a Hypergraph-Enhanced DuAL framework named HEAL for\nsemi-supervised graph classification, which captures graph semantics from the\nperspective of the hypergraph and the line graph, respectively. Specifically,\nto better explore the higher-order relationships among nodes, we design a\nhypergraph structure learning to adaptively learn complex node dependencies\nbeyond pairwise relations. Meanwhile, based on the learned hypergraph, we\nintroduce a line graph to capture the interaction between hyperedges, thereby\nbetter mining the underlying semantic structures. Finally, we develop a\nrelational consistency learning to facilitate knowledge transfer between the\ntwo branches and provide better mutual guidance. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world graph datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method\nagainst existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Although Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning in Artificial\nIntelligence of Things (AIoT) design, it fails to work on low-memory AIoT\ndevices due to its heavy memory usage. To address this problem, various\nfederated pruning methods are proposed to reduce memory usage during inference.\nHowever, few of them can substantially mitigate the memory burdens during\npruning and training. As an alternative, zeroth-order or backpropagation-free\n(BP-Free) methods can partially alleviate the memory consumption, but they\nsuffer from scaling up and large computation overheads, since the gradient\nestimation error and floating point operations (FLOPs) increase as the\ndimensionality of the model parameters grows. In this paper, we propose a\nfederated foresight pruning method based on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which\ncan seamlessly integrate with federated BP-Free training frameworks. We present\nan approximation to the computation of federated NTK by using the local NTK\nmatrices. Moreover, we demonstrate that the data-free property of our method\ncan substantially reduce the approximation error in extreme data heterogeneity\nscenarios. Since our approach improves the performance of the vanilla BP-Free\nmethod with fewer FLOPs and truly alleviates memory pressure during training\nand inference, it makes FL more friendly to low-memory devices. Comprehensive\nexperimental results obtained from simulation- and real test-bed-based\nplatforms show that our federated foresight-pruning method not only preserves\nthe ability of the dense model with a memory reduction up to 9x but also boosts\nthe performance of the vanilla BP-Free method with dramatically fewer FLOPs.",

As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats\ncontinue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can\nautomatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks.\nIn this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the\napplication of LLMs in cybersecurity (LLM4Security). By comprehensively\ncollecting over 30K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 127 papers\nfrom top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic\nview of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the\ncybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings.\nFirst, we observe that LLMs are being applied to a wide range of cybersecurity\ntasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, network intrusion\ndetection, and phishing detection. Second, we find that the datasets used for\ntraining and evaluating LLMs in these tasks are often limited in size and\ndiversity, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and representative\ndatasets. Third, we identify several promising techniques for adapting LLMs to\nspecific cybersecurity domains, such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and\ndomain-specific pre-training. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and\nopportunities for future research in LLM4Security, including the need for more\ninterpretable and explainable models, the importance of addressing data privacy\nand security concerns, and the potential for leveraging LLMs for proactive\ndefense and threat hunting. Overall, our survey provides a comprehensive\noverview of the current state-of-the-art in LLM4Security and identifies several\npromising directions for future research.",

Even though previous research has\nproposed various methods to construct attack knowledge graphs, they generally\nsuffer from limited generalization capability to diverse knowledge types as\nwell as requirement of expertise in model design and tuning. Addressing these\nlimitations, we seek to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), which have\nachieved enormous success in a broad range of tasks given exceptional\ncapabilities in both language understanding and zero-shot task fulfillment.\nThus, we propose a fully automatic LLM-based framework to construct attack\nknowledge graphs named: AttacKG+.

We represent a cyber attack as a temporally unfolding\nevent, each temporal step of which encapsulates three layers of representation,\nincluding behavior graph, MITRE TTP labels, and state summary. Extensive\nevaluation demonstrates that: 1) our formulation seamlessly satisfies the\ninformation needs in threat event analysis, 2) our construction framework is\neffective in faithfully and accurately extracting the information defined by\nAttacKG+, and 3) our attack graph directly benefits downstream security\npractices such as attack reconstruction.

Recently, lightweight methods that require\nalmost no training have been recently proposed to reduce overall computation.\nHowever, existing methods still have room to improve the trade-offs among\naccuracy, efficiency, and robustness. In particular, there are no well-designed\nclosed-form studies for \\emph{balanced} CF in terms of the aforementioned\ntrade-offs. In this paper, we design SVD-AE, a simple yet effective singular\nvector decomposition (SVD)-based linear autoencoder, whose closed-form solution\ncan be defined based on SVD for CF. SVD-AE does not require iterative training\nprocesses as its closed-form solution can be calculated at once. Furthermore,\ngiven the noisy nature of the rating matrix, we explore the robustness against\nsuch noisy interactions of existing CF methods and our SVD-AE. As a result, we\ndemonstrate that our simple design choice based on truncated SVD can be used to\nstrengthen the noise robustness of the recommendation while improving\nefficiency.

Unlike prior EQA work\ntackling simple queries that directly reference target objects and properties\n(\"What is the color of the car?\"), situational queries (such as \"Is the house\nready for sleeptime?\") are challenging as they require the agent to correctly\nidentify multiple object-states (Doors: Closed, Lights: Off, etc.) and reach a\nconsensus on their states for an answer. Towards this objective, we first\nintroduce a novel Prompt-Generate-Evaluate (PGE) scheme that wraps around an\nLLM's output to generate unique situational queries and corresponding consensus\nobject information. PGE is used to generate 2K datapoints in the VirtualHome\nsimulator, which is then annotated for ground truth answers via a large scale\nuser-study conducted on M-Turk. With a high rate of answerability (97.26%) on\nthis study, we establish that LLMs are good at generating situational data.\nHowever, in evaluating the data using an LLM, we observe a low correlation of\n46.2% with the ground truth human annotations; indicating that while LLMs are\ngood at generating situational data, they struggle to answer them according to\nconsensus. When asked for reasoning, we observe the LLM often goes against\ncommonsense in justifying its answer. Finally, we utilize PGE to generate\nsituational data in a real-world environment, exposing LLM hallucination in\ngenerating reliable object-states when a structured scene graph is unavailable.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce EQA in the\ncontext of situational queries and also the first to present a generative\napproach for query creation.

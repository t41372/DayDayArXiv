    "abstract": "Aerial and satellite imagery are inherently complementary remote sensing\nsources, offering high-resolution detail alongside expansive spatial coverage.\nHowever, the use of these sources for land cover segmentation introduces\nseveral challenges, prompting the development of a variety of segmentation\nmethods. Among these approaches, the DeepLabV3+ architecture is considered as a\npromising approach in the field of single-source image segmentation. However,\ndespite its reliable results for segmentation, there is still a need to\nincrease its robustness and improve its performance. This is particularly\ncrucial for multimodal image segmentation, where the fusion of diverse types of\ninformation is essential.\n  An interesting approach involves enhancing this architectural framework\nthrough the integration of novel components and the modification of certain\ninternal processes.\n  In this paper, we enhance the DeepLabV3+ architecture by introducing a new\ntransposed conventional layers block for upsampling a second entry to fuse it\nwith high level features. This block is designed to amplify and integrate\ninformation from satellite images, thereby enriching the segmentation process\nthrough fusion with aerial images.\n  For experiments, we used the LandCover.ai (Land Cover from Aerial Imagery)\ndataset for aerial images, alongside the corresponding dataset sourced from\nSentinel 2 data.\n  Through the fusion of both sources, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)\nachieved a total mIoU of 84.91% without data augmentation.",

Traditional process\nmodeling demands significant manual effort, domain expertise, and familiarity\nwith complex languages like Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), creating\nbarriers for non-techincal users. We introduce SOP Structuring (SOPStruct), a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform SOPs\ninto decision-tree-based structured representations. SOPStruct produces a\nstandardized representation of SOPs across different domains, reduces cognitive\nload, and improves user comprehension by effectively capturing task\ndependencies and ensuring sequential integrity. Our approach enables leveraging\nthe structured information to automate workflows as well as empower the human\nusers. By organizing procedures into logical graphs, SOPStruct facilitates\nbacktracking and error correction, offering a scalable solution for process\noptimization. We employ a novel evaluation framework, combining deterministic\nmethods with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) to verify graph\nsoundness, and non-deterministic assessment by an LLM to ensure completeness.\nWe empirically validate the robustness of our LLM-based structured SOP\nrepresentation methodology across SOPs from different domains and varying\nlevels of complexity.

To\novercome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model\nsize and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to\nquantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a\nparticular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance.\nHowever, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different\nscenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for\nenhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To\nthis end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both\nMamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment\non various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation\npersistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a\nlinear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined\nwith a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$.\nTo ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline\naccording to the clustering sequence.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation models, especially Multimodal Diffusion Transformers\n(MMDiT), have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images.\nHowever, these models often face significant computational bottlenecks,\nparticularly in attention mechanisms, which hinder their scalability and\nefficiency. In this paper, we introduce DiTFastAttnV2, a post-training\ncompression method designed to accelerate attention in MMDiT. Through an\nin-depth analysis of MMDiT's attention patterns, we identify key differences\nfrom prior DiT-based methods and propose head-wise arrow attention and caching\nmechanisms to dynamically adjust attention heads, effectively bridging this\ngap. We also design an Efficient Fused Kernel for further acceleration. By\nleveraging local metric methods and optimization techniques, our approach\nsignificantly reduces the search time for optimal compression schemes to just\nminutes while maintaining generation quality. Furthermore, with the customized\nkernel, DiTFastAttnV2 achieves a 68% reduction in attention FLOPs and 1.5x\nend-to-end speedup on 2K image generation without compromising visual fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Most 3D object generators focus on aesthetic quality, often neglecting\nphysical constraints necessary in applications. One such constraint is that the\n3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remains balanced under gravity.\nPrior approaches to generating stable 3D objects used differentiable physics\nsimulators to optimize geometry at test-time, which is slow, unstable, and\nprone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models\nto external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO), a\nframework to use the feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase\nthe likelihood that the 3D generator outputs stable 3D objects directly. We\nconstruct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with a stability score obtained from\nthe physics simulator. We can then fine-tune the 3D generator using the\nstability score as the alignment metric, via direct preference optimization\n(DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO), a novel objective, which we\nintroduce, to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences.\nOur experiments show that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either\nDPO or DRO objective, is much faster and more likely to produce stable objects\nthan test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework works even without any\nground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve\nby automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs.",

    "abstract": "Sequential Recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item by capturing\nsequential patterns from users' historical interactions, playing a crucial role\nin many real-world recommender systems. However, existing approaches\npredominantly adopt a direct forward computation paradigm, where the final\nhidden state of the sequence encoder serves as the user representation. We\nargue that this inference paradigm, due to its limited computational depth,\nstruggles to model the complex evolving nature of user preferences and lacks a\nnuanced understanding of long-tail items, leading to suboptimal performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose \\textbf{ReaRec}, the first inference-time\ncomputing framework for recommender systems, which enhances user\nrepresentations through implicit multi-step reasoning. Specifically, ReaRec\nautoregressively feeds the sequence's last hidden state into the sequential\nrecommender while incorporating special reasoning position embeddings to\ndecouple the original item encoding space from the multi-step reasoning space.\nMoreover, we introduce two lightweight reasoning-based learning methods,\nEnsemble Reasoning Learning (ERL) and Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL), to\nfurther effectively exploit ReaRec's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments\non five public real-world datasets and different SeqRec architectures\ndemonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our proposed ReaRec.\nRemarkably, post-hoc analyses reveal that ReaRec significantly elevates the\nperformance ceiling of multiple sequential recommendation backbones by\napproximately 30\\%-50\\%. Thus, we believe this work can open a new and\npromising avenue for future research in inference-time computing for sequential\nrecommendation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a large amount of work has focused on improving large language\nmodels' (LLMs') performance on reasoning benchmarks such as math and logic.\nHowever, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real\nworld, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through\nacquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction\nproblem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this\nformalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can\nrigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question\nto ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present\nQuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most\none question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one\nmissing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states\nthat are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math\nproblems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of\nGSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators.\nThe LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a\nlist of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their\naccuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that\nthe ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient\nfor success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right\nquestion to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the\nproblem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even\nwhen explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.''

In contrast, text data is abundant and inexpensive, prompting the\nquestion: can high-quality multimodal training data be synthesized purely from\ntext? To tackle this, we propose a cross-integrated three-stage multimodal data\nsynthesis framework, which generates two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M and\nUnicorn-471K-Instruction. In Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, we\nconstruct 1.2M semantically diverse high-quality captions by expanding sparse\ncaption seeds using large language models (LLMs). In Stage 2:\nInstruction-Tuning Data Generation, we further process 471K captions into\nmulti-turn instruction-tuning tasks to support complex reasoning. Finally, in\nStage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, these textual captions\nrepresentations are transformed into visual representations, resulting in\ndiverse synthetic image representations. This three-stage process enables us to\nconstruct Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for\ninstruction-tuning, without relying on real images. By eliminating the\ndependency on real images while maintaining data quality and diversity, our\nframework offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for VLMs training.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive next-step prediction models have become the de-facto standard\nfor building data-driven neural solvers to forecast time-dependent partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). Denoise training that is closely related to\ndiffusion probabilistic model has been shown to enhance the temporal stability\nof neural solvers, while its stochastic inference mechanism enables ensemble\npredictions and uncertainty quantification. In principle, such training\ninvolves sampling a series of discretized diffusion timesteps during both\ntraining and inference, inevitably increasing computational overhead. In\naddition, most diffusion models apply isotropic Gaussian noise on structured,\nuniform grids, limiting their adaptability to irregular domains. We propose a\nlatent diffusion model for PDE simulation that embeds the PDE state in a\nlower-dimensional latent space, which significantly reduces computational\ncosts. Our framework uses an autoencoder to map different types of meshes onto\na unified structured latent grid, capturing complex geometries. By analyzing\ncommon diffusion paths, we propose to use a coarsely sampled noise schedule\nfrom flow matching for both training and testing. Numerical experiments show\nthat the proposed model outperforms several deterministic baselines in both\naccuracy and long-term stability, highlighting the potential of diffusion-based\napproaches for robust data-driven PDE learning.",

This paper introduces a novel\nmethod for VAT prediction in pre-cystectomy CT, which is fully automated and\ndoes not require ground-truth VAT masks for training, overcoming aforementioned\nlimitations. Methods: We introduce the Kernel density Enhanced VAT Segmentator\n( KEVS), combining a DL semantic segmentation model, for multi-body feature\nprediction, with Gaussian kernel density estimation analysis of predicted\nsubcutaneous adipose tissue to achieve accurate scan-specific predictions of\nVAT in the abdominal cavity. Uniquely for a DL pipeline, KEVS does not require\nground-truth VAT masks. Results: We verify the ability of KEVS to accurately\nsegment abdominal organs in unseen CT data and compare KEVS VAT segmentation\npredictions to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in a dataset of 20\npre-cystectomy CT scans, collected from University College London Hospital\n(UCLH-Cyst), with expert ground-truth annotations. KEVS presents a 4.80% and\n6.02% improvement in Dice Coefficient over the second best DL and\nthresholding-based VAT segmentation techniques respectively when evaluated on\nUCLH-Cyst. Conclusion: This research introduces KEVS; an automated, SOTA method\nfor the prediction of VAT in pre-cystectomy CT which eliminates inter-observer\nvariability and is trained entirely on open-source CT datasets which do not\ncontain ground-truth VAT masks.",

Numerous implementations of the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms responsible for training these agents, like the\nDeep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms,\ncurrently exist. However, studies make the mistake of assuming implementations\nof the same algorithm to be consistent and thus, interchangeable. In this\npaper, through a differential testing lens, we present the results of studying\nthe extent of implementation inconsistencies, their effect on the\nimplementations' performance, as well as their impact on the conclusions of\nprior studies under the assumption of interchangeable implementations. The\noutcomes of our differential tests showed significant discrepancies between the\ntested algorithm implementations, indicating that they are not interchangeable.\nIn particular, out of the five PPO implementations tested on 56 games, three\nimplementations achieved superhuman performance for 50% of their total trials\nwhile the other two implementations only achieved superhuman performance for\nless than 15% of their total trials. As part of a meticulous manual analysis of\nthe implementations' source code, we analyzed implementation discrepancies and\ndetermined that code-level inconsistencies primarily caused these\ndiscrepancies. Lastly, we replicated a study and showed that this assumption of\nimplementation interchangeability was sufficient to flip experiment outcomes.\nTherefore, this calls for a shift in how implementations are being used.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic assets from video data is central to many in computer\nvision and graphics tasks. Existing 4D reconstruction approaches are limited by\ncategory-specific models or slow optimization-based methods. Inspired by the\nrecent Large Reconstruction Model (LRM), we present the Large Interpolation\nModel (LIM), a transformer-based feed-forward solution, guided by a novel\ncausal consistency loss, for interpolating implicit 3D representations across\ntime. Given implicit 3D representations at times $t_0$ and $t_1$, LIM produces\na deformed shape at any continuous time $t\\in[t_0,t_1]$, delivering\nhigh-quality interpolated frames in seconds. Furthermore, LIM allows explicit\nmesh tracking across time, producing a consistently uv-textured mesh sequence\nready for integration into existing production pipelines. We also use LIM, in\nconjunction with a diffusion-based multiview generator, to produce dynamic 4D\nreconstructions from monocular videos. We evaluate LIM on various dynamic\ndatasets, benchmarking against image-space interpolation methods (e.g., FiLM)\nand direct triplane linear interpolation, and demonstrate clear advantages. In\nsummary, LIM is the first feed-forward model capable of high-speed tracked 4D\nasset reconstruction across diverse categories.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous exploration in mobile robotics often involves a trade-off between\ntwo objectives: maximizing environmental coverage and minimizing the total path\nlength. In the widely used information gain paradigm, exploration is guided by\nthe expected value of observations. While this approach is effective under\nbudget-constrained settings--where only a limited number of observations can be\nmade--it fails to align with quality-constrained scenarios, in which the robot\nmust fully explore the environment to a desired level of certainty or quality.\nIn such cases, total information gain is effectively fixed, and maximizing it\nper step can lead to inefficient, greedy behavior and unnecessary backtracking.\nThis paper argues that information gain should not serve as an optimization\nobjective in quality-constrained exploration. Instead, it should be used to\nfilter viable candidate actions. We propose a novel heuristic, distance\nadvantage, which selects candidate frontiers based on a trade-off between\nproximity to the robot and remoteness from other frontiers. This heuristic aims\nto reduce future detours by prioritizing exploration of isolated regions before\nthe robot's opportunity to visit them efficiently has passed. We evaluate our\nmethod in simulated environments against classical frontier-based exploration\nand gain-maximizing approaches. Results show that distance advantage\nsignificantly reduces total path length across a variety of environments, both\nwith and without access to prior map predictions.

As a result, control systems often\nassume idealized heliostat surfaces, leading to suboptimal performance and\npotential safety risks.

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL automatically translates natural language queries to SQL,\nallowing non-technical users to retrieve data from databases without\nspecialized SQL knowledge. Despite the success of advanced LLM-based\nText-to-SQL approaches on leaderboards, their unsustainable computational\ncosts--often overlooked--stand as the \"elephant in the room\" in current\nleaderboard-driven research, limiting their economic practicability for\nreal-world deployment and widespread adoption. To tackle this, we exploratively\npropose EllieSQL, a complexity-aware routing framework that assigns queries to\nsuitable SQL generation pipelines based on estimated complexity. We investigate\nmultiple routers to direct simple queries to efficient approaches while\nreserving computationally intensive methods for complex cases. Drawing from\neconomics, we introduce the Token Elasticity of Performance (TEP) metric,\ncapturing cost-efficiency by quantifying the responsiveness of performance\ngains relative to token investment in SQL generation. Experiments show that\ncompared to always using the most advanced methods in our study, EllieSQL with\nthe Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO router reduces token use by over 40% without compromising\nperformance on Bird development set, achieving more than a 2x boost in TEP over\nnon-routing approaches.

For non-numeric queries, this\nis done by considering a cooperative game whose players are the facts and whose\nwealth function assigns 1 or 0 to each subset of the database, depending on\nwhether the query answer holds in the given subset. While conceptually simple,\nthis approach suffers from a notable drawback: the problem of computing such\nShapley values is #P-hard in data complexity, even for simple conjunctive\nqueries. This motivates us to revisit the question of what constitutes a\nreasonable responsibility measure and to introduce a new family of\nresponsibility measures -- weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS) -- which\nsatisfy intuitive properties.

Moreover, WSMS measures enjoy tractable data\ncomplexity for a large class of queries, including all unions of conjunctive\nqueries.

    "abstract": "Effective patient communication is pivotal in healthcare, yet traditional\nmedical training often lacks exposure to diverse, challenging interpersonal\ndynamics. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the use of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate authentic patient communication styles, specifically\nthe \"accuser\" and \"rationalizer\" personas derived from the Satir model, while\nalso ensuring multilingual applicability to accommodate diverse cultural\ncontexts and enhance accessibility for medical professionals. Leveraging\nadvanced prompt engineering, including behavioral prompts, author's notes, and\nstubbornness mechanisms, we developed virtual patients (VPs) that embody\nnuanced emotional and conversational traits. Medical professionals evaluated\nthese VPs, rating their authenticity (accuser: $3.8 \\pm 1.0$; rationalizer:\n$3.7 \\pm 0.8$ on a 5-point Likert scale (from one to five)) and correctly\nidentifying their styles. Emotion analysis revealed distinct profiles: the\naccuser exhibited pain, anger, and distress, while the rationalizer displayed\ncontemplation and calmness, aligning with predefined, detailed patient\ndescription including medical history. Sentiment scores (on a scale from zero\nto nine) further validated these differences in the communication styles, with\nthe accuser adopting negative ($3.1 \\pm 0.6$) and the rationalizer more neutral\n($4.0 \\pm 0.4$) tone. These results underscore LLMs' capability to replicate\ncomplex communication styles, offering transformative potential for medical\neducation. This approach equips trainees to navigate challenging clinical\nscenarios by providing realistic, adaptable patient interactions, enhancing\nempathy and diagnostic acumen. Our findings advocate for AI-driven tools as\nscalable, cost-effective solutions to cultivate nuanced communication skills,\nsetting a foundation for future innovations in healthcare training.",

Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy\nlearning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences.\nHowever, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep\ncontextual understanding of user interests.

Selecting the appropriate verification\nalgorithm typically demands domain expertise and non-trivial manpower. An\nautomated algorithm selector is thus desired. However, existing selectors,\neither depend on machine-learned strategies or manually designed heuristics,\nencounter issues such as reliance on high-quality samples with algorithm labels\nand limited scalability. In this paper, an automated algorithm selection\napproach, namely MFH, is proposed for software verification. Our approach\nleverages the heuristics that verifiers producing correct results typically\nimplement certain appropriate algorithms, and the supported algorithms by these\nverifiers indirectly reflect which ones are potentially applicable.\nSpecifically, MFH embeds the code property graph (CPG) of a semantic-preserving\ntransformed program to enhance the robustness of the prediction model.\nFurthermore, our approach decomposes the selection task into the sub-tasks of\npredicting potentially applicable algorithms and matching the most appropriate\nverifiers. Additionally, MFH also introduces a feedback loop on incorrect\npredictions to improve model prediction accuracy. We evaluate MFH on 20\nverifiers and over 15,000 verification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of MFH, achieving a prediction accuracy of 91.47% even\nwithout ground truth algorithm labels provided during the training phase.\nMoreover, the prediction accuracy decreases only by 0.84% when introducing 10\nnew verifiers, indicating the strong scalability of the proposed approach.",

Traditionally, it is argued that AI will\ngain human skills over time, and that these skills are innate and immutable in\nhumans. By contrast, I argue that humans may lose such skills as critical\nthinking, decision-making and even social care in an AGI world. The biggest\nthreat to humanity is therefore not that machines will become more like humans,\nbut that humans will become more like machines.",

This cost\ncan be mitigated by carefully selecting the data points presented for\nannotation. In this work, we propose an active learning approach to efficiently\nselect prompt and preference pairs using a risk assessment strategy based on\nthe Sharpe Ratio.

We also\nintroduce two variants of our method, each making different assumptions about\nprior information.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nrobotic planning, particularly for long-horizon tasks that require a holistic\nunderstanding of the environment for task decomposition. Existing methods\ntypically rely on prior environmental knowledge or carefully designed\ntask-specific prompts, making them struggle with dynamic scene changes or\nunexpected task conditions, e.g., a robot attempting to put a carrot in the\nmicrowave but finds the door was closed. Such challenges underscore two\ncritical issues: adaptability and efficiency. To address them, in this work, we\npropose an adaptive multi-agent planning framework, termed REMAC, that enables\nefficient, scene-agnostic multi-robot long-horizon task planning and execution\nthrough continuous reflection and self-evolution. REMAC incorporates two key\nmodules: a self-reflection module performing pre-condition and post-condition\nchecks in the loop to evaluate progress and refine plans, and a self-evolvement\nmodule dynamically adapting plans based on scene-specific reasoning. It offers\nseveral appealing benefits: 1) Robots can initially explore and reason about\nthe environment without complex prompt design. 2) Robots can keep reflecting on\npotential planning errors and adapting the plan based on task-specific\ninsights. 3) After iterations, a robot can call another one to coordinate tasks\nin parallel, maximizing the task execution efficiency. To validate REMAC's\neffectiveness, we build a multi-agent environment for long-horizon robot\nmanipulation and navigation based on RoboCasa, featuring 4 task categories with\n27 task styles and 50+ different objects. Based on it, we further benchmark\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, o3-mini, QwQ, and\nGrok3, demonstrating REMAC's superiority by boosting average success rates by\n40% and execution efficiency by 52.7% over the single robot baseline.",

We propose a two-stage framework that combines structured\nmodel compression with a scientific fine-tuning regimen to address this\nchallenge. In the compression stage, we decompose the LLM's weight matrices\ninto local low-rank \"rank blocks\" and arrange these blocks in a Penrose-like\nnon-periodic tiling pattern. Each block is then compacted via spectral\ntransformations (e.g., discrete cosine or Fourier transforms), and a\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based alignment loss preserves the\ndistributional similarity between the compressed model's representations and\nthose of the original full model. In the adaptation stage, the compressed model\nis further tuned using a human-like scientific reading protocol: it processes\ntechnical materials science documents section by section, engaging in a\nstructured question-and-answer routine for each section. This section-wise Q&A\nfine-tuning strategy extracts explicit reasoning traces and gradually injects\ndomain knowledge, while minimizing catastrophic forgetting of the model's\ngeneral language capabilities. By balancing efficient compression with targeted\nadaptation, our two-stage approach enables precise specialization of LLMs to\nhigh-value domains under data-scarce conditions.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer, the most common malignancy among women, requires precise\ndetection and classification for effective treatment. Immunohistochemistry\n(IHC) biomarkers like HER2, ER, and PR are critical for identifying breast\ncancer subtypes. However, traditional IHC classification relies on\npathologists' expertise, making it labor-intensive and subject to significant\ninter-observer variability. To address these challenges, this study introduces\nthe India Pathology Breast Cancer Dataset (IPD-Breast), comprising of 1,272 IHC\nslides (HER2, ER, and PR) aimed at automating receptor status classification.\nThe primary focus is on developing predictive models for HER2 3-way\nclassification (0, Low, High) to enhance prognosis. Evaluation of multiple deep\nlearning models revealed that an end-to-end ConvNeXt network utilizing\nlow-resolution IHC images achieved an AUC, F1, and accuracy of 91.79%, 83.52%,\nand 83.56%, respectively, for 3-way classification, outperforming patch-based\nmethods by over 5.35% in F1 score. This study highlights the potential of\nsimple yet effective deep learning techniques to significantly improve accuracy\nand reproducibility in breast cancer classification, supporting their\nintegration into clinical workflows for better patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential for\noptimal patient management. Differentiating between pre-capillary and\npost-capillary PH is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This study\ndevelops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed\nto classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This\nretrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH,\n32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated\nHospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right\nheart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test\nset (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training\nset. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep\nlearning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional\nneural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process\nmultimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH)\nsequences, and clinical parameters. Our model achieved a performance of Area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 +- 0.06(standard\ndeviation) and Accuracy (ACC) = 0.73 +- 0.06 on the test set. The\ndiscriminative abilities were as follows: non-PH subjects (AUC = 0.74 +- 0.11),\npre-capillary PH (AUC = 0.86 +- 0.06), and post-capillary PH (AUC = 0.83 +-\n0.10). It has the potential to support clinical decision-making by effectively\nintegrating multimodal data to assist physicians in making accurate and timely\ndiagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to revolutionize the design,\noptimization and management of next-generation communication systems. In this\narticle, we explore the integration of large AI models (LAMs) into semantic\ncommunications (SemCom) by leveraging their multi-modal data processing and\ngeneration capabilities. Although LAMs bring unprecedented abilities to extract\nsemantics from raw data, this integration entails multifaceted challenges\nincluding high resource demands, model complexity, and the need for\nadaptability across diverse modalities and tasks. To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose a LAM-based multi-task SemCom (MTSC) architecture, which includes an\nadaptive model compression strategy and a federated split fine-tuning approach\nto facilitate the efficient deployment of LAM-based semantic models in\nresource-limited networks. Furthermore, a retrieval-augmented generation scheme\nis implemented to synthesize the most recent local and global knowledge bases\nto enhance the accuracy of semantic extraction and content generation, thereby\nimproving the inference performance. Finally, simulation results demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the proposed LAM-based MTSC architecture, highlighting the\nperformance enhancements across various downstream tasks under varying channel\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous or streaming machine translation generates translation while\nreading the input stream. These systems face a quality/latency trade-off,\naiming to achieve high translation quality similar to non-streaming models with\nminimal latency. We propose an approach that efficiently manages this\ntrade-off. By enhancing a pretrained non-streaming model, which was trained\nwith a seq2seq mechanism and represents the upper bound in quality, we convert\nit into a streaming model by utilizing the alignment between source and target\ntokens. This alignment is used to learn a read/write decision boundary for\nreliable translation generation with minimal input. During training, the model\nlearns the decision boundary through a read/write policy module, employing\nsupervised learning on the alignment points (pseudo labels). The read/write\npolicy module, a small binary classification unit, can control the\nquality/latency trade-off during inference. Experimental results show that our\nmodel outperforms several strong baselines and narrows the gap with the\nnon-streaming baseline model.",

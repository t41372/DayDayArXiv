    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new dataset distillation method that considers\nbalancing global structure and local details when distilling the information\nfrom a large dataset into a generative model. Dataset distillation has been\nproposed to reduce the size of the required dataset when training models. The\nconventional dataset distillation methods face the problem of long redeployment\ntime and poor cross-architecture performance. Moreover, previous methods\nfocused too much on the high-level semantic attributes between the synthetic\ndataset and the original dataset while ignoring the local features such as\ntexture and shape. Based on the above understanding, we propose a new method\nfor distilling the original image dataset into a generative model. Our method\ninvolves using a conditional generative adversarial network to generate the\ndistilled dataset. Subsequently, we ensure balancing global structure and local\ndetails in the distillation process, continuously optimizing the generator for\nmore information-dense dataset generation.",

We introduce a novel customer\nservice question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph\n(KG). Our method constructs a KG from historical issues for use in retrieval,\nretaining the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations. During the\nquestion-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries and retrieves\nrelated sub-graphs from the KG to generate answers. This integration of a KG\nnot only improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure\ninformation but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of\ntext segmentation. Empirical assessments on our benchmark datasets, utilizing\nkey retrieval (MRR, Recall@K, NDCG@K) and text generation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR)\nmetrics, reveal that our method outperforms the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by\n0.32 in BLEU.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a framework in which agents can be\ntrained, via trial and error, to solve complex decision-making problems.\nLearning with little supervision causes RL methods to require large amounts of\ndata, rendering them too expensive for many applications (e.g., robotics). By\nreusing knowledge from a different task, knowledge transfer methods present an\nalternative to reduce the training time in RL. Given the severe data scarcity,\ndue to their flexibility, there has been a growing interest in methods capable\nof transferring knowledge across different domains (i.e., problems with\ndifferent representations). However, identifying similarities and adapting\nknowledge across tasks from different domains requires matching their\nrepresentations or finding domain-invariant features. These processes can be\ndata-demanding, which poses the main challenge in cross-domain knowledge\ntransfer: to select and transform knowledge in a data-efficient way, such that\nit accelerates learning in the target task, despite the presence of significant\ndifferences across problems (e.g., robots with distinct morphologies). Thus,\nthis review presents a unifying analysis of methods focused on transferring\nknowledge across different domains. Through a taxonomy based on a\ntransfer-approach categorization and a characterization of works based on their\ndata-assumption requirements, the contributions of this article are 1) a\ncomprehensive and systematic revision of knowledge transfer methods for the\ncross-domain RL setting, 2) a categorization and characterization of such\nmethods to provide an analysis based on relevant features such as their\ntransfer approach and data requirements, and 3) a discussion on the main\nchallenges regarding cross-domain knowledge transfer, as well as on ideas of\nfuture directions worth exploring to address these problems.",

To address this, we propose a new architecture-agnostic\ntraining paradigm called center-based relaxed learning (CRL), which is adaptive\nto any classification model and provides privacy preservation by sacrificing a\nminimal or no loss of model generalizability.

Consequently, current research struggles with this dilemma by\nassuming idealized degradations, which leads to limited applicability to actual\nuser data. Moreover, the ideal scenario - training models on data from the\ntargeted user base - presents significant privacy concerns. To address both\nchallenges, we propose to fuse image SR with federated learning, allowing\nreal-world degradations to be directly learned from users without invading\ntheir privacy. Furthermore, it enables optimization across many devices without\ndata centralization. As this fusion is underexplored, we introduce new\nbenchmarks specifically designed to evaluate new SR methods in this federated\nsetting. By doing so, we employ known degradation modeling techniques from SR\nresearch. However, rather than aiming to mirror real degradations, our\nbenchmarks use these degradation models to simulate the variety of degradations\nfound across clients within a distributed user base. This distinction is\ncrucial as it circumvents the need to precisely model real-world degradations,\nwhich limits contemporary blind image SR research. Our proposed benchmarks\ninvestigate blind image SR under new aspects, namely differently distributed\ndegradation types among users and varying user numbers. We believe new methods\ntested within these benchmarks will perform more similarly in an application,\nas the simulated scenario addresses the variety while federated learning\nenables the training on actual degradations.",

    "abstract": "One key decision for heuristic search algorithms is how to balance\nexploration and exploitation. In classical planning, novelty search has come\nout as the most successful approach in this respect. The idea is to favor\nstates that contain previously unseen facts when searching for a plan. This is\ndone by maintaining a record of the tuples of facts observed in previous\nstates. Then the novelty of a state is the size of the smallest previously\nunseen tuple. The most successful version of novelty search is best-first width\nsearch (BFWS), which combines novelty measures with heuristic estimates. An\northogonal approach to balance exploration-exploitation is to use several\nopen-lists. These open-lists are ordered using different heuristic estimates,\nwhich diversify the information used in the search. The search algorithm then\nalternates between these open-lists, trying to exploit these different\nestimates. This is the approach used by LAMA, a classical planner that, a\ndecade after its release, is still considered state-of-the-art in agile\nplanning. In this paper, we study how to combine LAMA and BFWS. We show that\nsimply adding the strongest open-list used in BFWS to LAMA harms performance.\nHowever, we show that combining only parts of each planner leads to a new\nstate-of-the-art agile planner.",

    "abstract": "Conventional mechanical design follows an iterative process in which initial\nconcepts are refined through cycles of expert assessment and resource-intensive\nFinite Element Method (FEM) analysis to meet performance goals. While machine\nlearning models have been developed to assist in parts of this process, they\ntypically require large datasets, extensive training, and are often tailored to\nspecific tasks, limiting their generalizability. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a framework that leverages a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM)\nin conjunction with an FEM module to autonomously generate, evaluate, and\nrefine structural designs based on performance specifications and numerical\nfeedback. The LLM operates without domain-specific fine-tuning, using general\nreasoning to propose design candidates, interpret FEM-derived performance\nmetrics, and apply structurally sound modifications. Using 2D truss structures\nas a testbed, we show that the LLM can effectively navigate highly discrete and\nmulti-faceted design spaces, balance competing objectives, and identify\nconvergence when further optimization yields diminishing returns. Compared to\nNon-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), our method achieves\nfaster convergence and fewer FEM evaluations. Experiments with varying\ntemperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 1.2) and model sizes (GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini)\nindicate that smaller models yield higher constraint satisfaction with fewer\nsteps, while lower temperatures enhance design consistency. These results\nestablish LLMs as a promising new class of reasoning-based, natural\nlanguage-driven optimizers for autonomous design and iterative structural\nrefinement.",

Contrastive learning\nhas witnessed success in image and natural language data, thanks to the\ndomain-specific augmentation techniques that are both intuitive and effective.\nNonetheless, in tabular domain, the predominant augmentation technique for\ncreating views is through corrupting tabular entries via swapping values, which\nis not as sound or effective. We propose a simple yet powerful improvement to\nthis augmentation technique: corrupting tabular data conditioned on class\nidentity. Specifically, when corrupting a specific tabular entry from an anchor\nrow, instead of randomly sampling a value in the same feature column from the\nentire table uniformly, we only sample from rows that are identified to be\nwithin the same class as the anchor row. We assume the semi-supervised learning\nsetting, and adopt the pseudo labeling technique for obtaining class identities\nover all table rows. We also explore the novel idea of selecting features to be\ncorrupted based on feature correlation structures. Extensive experiments show\nthat the proposed approach consistently outperforms the conventional corruption\nmethod for tabular data classification tasks.

This paper\npresents a novel method, namely Rad4XCNN, to enhance the predictive power of\nCNN-derived features with the inherent interpretability of radiomic features.\nRad4XCNN diverges from conventional methods based on saliency maps, by\nassociating intelligible meaning to CNN-derived features by means of Radiomics,\noffering new perspectives on explanation methods beyond visualization maps.\nUsing a breast cancer classification task as a case study, we evaluated\nRad4XCNN on ultrasound imaging datasets, including an online dataset and two\nin-house datasets for internal and external validation.

We show that if eigenvalues of\nthe integral operator of the NNGP decay slower than $k^{-n-\\frac{2}{3}}$ where\n$k$ is an order of an eigenvalue, then our theorem guarantees a more succinct\nneural network approximation than Barron's theorem. We also make some\ncomputational experiments to verify our theoretical findings. Our experiments\nshow that realistic neural networks easily learn target functions even when\nboth theorems do not give any guarantees.",

Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely\non local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish\nlong-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based\nmethods that focus on global information face high computational complexities\nwhen processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another\nperspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without\nintroducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more\nefficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range\ncorrelations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN)\nfor low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging\ntask of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks:\nthe first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and\nthe second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate\ninformation exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion\naffine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally,\nwe have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the\ncurrent lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement.\nExtensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Over the years, multimodal mobile sensing has been used extensively for\ninferences regarding health and well being, behavior, and context. However, a\nsignificant challenge hindering the widespread deployment of such models in\nreal world scenarios is the issue of distribution shift. This is the phenomenon\nwhere the distribution of data in the training set differs from the\ndistribution of data in the real world, the deployment environment. While\nextensively explored in computer vision and natural language processing, and\nwhile prior research in mobile sensing briefly addresses this concern, current\nwork primarily focuses on models dealing with a single modality of data, such\nas audio or accelerometer readings, and consequently, there is little research\non unsupervised domain adaptation when dealing with multimodal sensor data. To\naddress this gap, we did extensive experiments with domain adversarial neural\nnetworks (DANN) showing that they can effectively handle distribution shifts in\nmultimodal sensor data. Moreover, we proposed a novel improvement over DANN,\ncalled M3BAT, unsupervised domain adaptation for multimodal mobile sensing with\nmulti-branch adversarial training, to account for the multimodality of sensor\ndata during domain adaptation with multiple branches. Through extensive\nexperiments conducted on two multimodal mobile sensing datasets, three\ninference tasks, and 14 source-target domain pairs, including both regression\nand classification, we demonstrate that our approach performs effectively on\nunseen domains. Compared to directly deploying a model trained in the source\ndomain to the target domain, the model shows performance increases up to 12%\nAUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves) on\nclassification tasks, and up to 0.13 MAE (mean absolute error) on regression\ntasks.",

While Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in NLP tasks, their efficacy in\ngenerating high-quality CFs remains uncertain. This work fills this gap by\ninvestigating how well LLMs generate CFs for two NLU tasks. We conduct a\ncomprehensive comparison of several common LLMs, and evaluate their CFs,\nassessing both intrinsic metrics, and the impact of these CFs on data\naugmentation. Moreover, we analyze differences between human and LLM-generated\nCFs, providing insights for future research directions. Our results show that\nLLMs generate fluent CFs, but struggle to keep the induced changes minimal.\nGenerating CFs for Sentiment Analysis (SA) is less challenging than NLI where\nLLMs show weaknesses in generating CFs that flip the original label. This also\nreflects on the data augmentation performance, where we observe a large gap\nbetween augmenting with human and LLMs CFs. Furthermore, we evaluate LLMs'\nability to assess CFs in a mislabelled data setting, and show that they have a\nstrong bias towards agreeing with the provided labels.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has favoured major\nlanguages such as English, leaving a significant gap for many others due to\nlimited resources. This is especially evident in the context of data\nannotation, a task whose importance cannot be underestimated, but which is\ntime-consuming and costly. Thus, any dataset for resource-poor languages is\nprecious, in particular when it is task-specific. Here, we explore the\nfeasibility of repurposing an existing multilingual dataset for a new NLP task:\nwe repurpose a subset of the BELEBELE dataset (Bandarkar et al., 2023), which\nwas designed for multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), to enable the more\npractical task of extractive QA (EQA) in the style of machine reading\ncomprehension. We present annotation guidelines and a parallel EQA dataset for\nEnglish and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We also present QA evaluation results\nfor several monolingual and cross-lingual QA pairs including English, MSA, and\nfive Arabic dialects. We aim to help others adapt our approach for the\nremaining 120 BELEBELE language variants, many of which are deemed\nunder-resourced. We also provide a thorough analysis and share insights to\ndeepen understanding of the challenges and opportunities in NLP task\nreformulation.",

Event cameras, which\nencode temporal changes in light intensity as asynchronous binary spikes, offer\nunique advantages such as low latency, high dynamic range, and energy\nefficiency. However, their unconventional spiking output and the scarcity of\nlabelled datasets pose significant challenges to traditional image-based depth\nestimation methods.

However, the existing methods for MCS detection mostly targets\non single-frame detection, which just considers the static characteristics and\nignores the temporal evolution in the life cycle of MCS. In this paper, we\npropose a novel encoder-decoder neural network for MCS detection(MCSDNet).\nMCSDNet has a simple architecture and is easy to expand.

Firstly, we\ndesign a multi-scale spatiotemporal information module to extract multi-level\nsemantic from different encoder levels, which makes our models can extract more\ndetail spatiotemporal features. Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Mix Unit(STMU) is\nintroduced to MCSDNet to capture both intra-frame features and inter-frame\ncorrelations, which is a scalable module and can be replaced by other\nspatiotemporal module, e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer and our proposed Dual\nSpatiotemporal Attention(DSTA). This means that the future works about\nspatiotemporal modules can be easily integrated to our model.

To accelerate meteorological\nsimulations, researchers have utilized neural networks to downscale\nmeteorological variables from low-resolution simulations. Despite notable\nadvancements, contemporary cutting-edge downscaling algorithms tailored to\nspecific variables. Addressing meteorological variables in isolation overlooks\ntheir interconnectedness, leading to an incomplete understanding of atmospheric\ndynamics.

This framework aims to facilitate the\ndownscaling of diverse meteorological variables derived from various numerical\nmodels and spatiotemporal scales. Trained at variables consisted of\ntemperature, wind, surface pressure and total precipitation from ERA5 and GFS,\nthe proposed method can be extended to downscale convective precipitation,\npotential energy, height, humidity and ozone from CFS, S2S and CMIP6 at\ndifferent spatiotemporal scales, which demonstrating its capability to capture\nthe interconnections among diverse variables.

    "abstract": "Social anxiety represents a prevalent challenge in modern society, affecting\nindividuals across personal and professional spheres. Left unaddressed, this\ncondition can yield substantial negative consequences, impacting social\ninteractions and performance. Further understanding its diverse physical and\nemotional symptoms becomes pivotal for comprehensive diagnosis and tailored\ntherapeutic interventions. This study analyze prevalence and frequency of\nsocial anxiety symptoms taken from Mayo Clinic, exploring diverse human\nexperiences from utilizing a large Reddit dataset dedicated to this issue.\nLeveraging these platforms, the research aims to extract insights and examine a\nspectrum of physical and emotional symptoms linked to social anxiety disorder.\nUpholding ethical considerations, the study maintains strict user anonymity\nwithin the dataset. By employing a novel approach, the research utilizes\nBART-based multi-label zero-shot classification to identify and measure symptom\nprevalence and significance in the form of probability score for each symptom\nunder consideration. Results uncover distinctive patterns: \"Trembling\" emerges\nas a prevalent physical symptom, while emotional symptoms like \"Fear of being\njudged negatively\" exhibit high frequencies. These findings offer insights into\nthe multifaceted nature of social anxiety, aiding clinical practices and\ninterventions tailored to its diverse expressions.",

In\nthis study, we hypothesize that recent advances in text-to-image generative\nmodels make them valuable for benchmarking computer vision models such as image\nclassifiers: they can generate images conditioned by textual prompts that cause\nclassifier failures, allowing failure conditions to be described with textual\nattributes.

However, increasing research\nfinds that when faced with noisy and biased data, the model's representation\nnetwork is more reliable than the classification network. Additionally, label\ngeneration methods based on model predictions often show poor adaptability\nacross different datasets, necessitating customization of the classification\nnetwork. Therefore, we propose a Hierarchical Dynamic Labeling (HDL) algorithm\nthat does not depend on model predictions and utilizes image embeddings to\ngenerate sample labels. We also introduce an adaptive method for selecting\nhyperparameters in HDL, enhancing its versatility. Moreover, HDL can be\ncombined with general image encoders (e.g., CLIP) to serve as a fundamental\ndata processing module. We extract embeddings from datasets with class-balanced\nand long-tailed distributions using pre-trained semi-supervised models.\nSubsequently, samples are re-labeled using HDL, and the re-labeled samples are\nused to further train the semi-supervised models. Experiments demonstrate\nimproved model performance, validating the motivation that representation\nnetworks are more reliable than classifiers or predictors.

    "abstract": "The Natural Language to Visualization (NL2Vis) task aims to transform\nnatural-language descriptions into visual representations for a grounded table,\nenabling users to gain insights from vast amounts of data. Recently, many deep\nlearning-based approaches have been developed for NL2Vis. Despite the\nconsiderable efforts made by these approaches, challenges persist in\nvisualizing data sourced from unseen databases or spanning multiple tables.\nTaking inspiration from the remarkable generation capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), this paper conducts an empirical study to evaluate\ntheir potential in generating visualizations, and explore the effectiveness of\nin-context learning prompts for enhancing this task. In particular, we first\nexplore the ways of transforming structured tabular data into sequential text\nprompts, as to feed them into LLMs and analyze which table content contributes\nmost to the NL2Vis. Our findings suggest that transforming structured tabular\ndata into programs is effective, and it is essential to consider the table\nschema when formulating prompts. Furthermore, we evaluate two types of LLMs:\nfinetuned models (e.g., T5-Small) and inference-only models (e.g., GPT-3.5),\nagainst state-of-the-art methods, using the NL2Vis benchmarks (i.e., nvBench).\nThe experimental results reveal that LLMs outperform baselines, with\ninference-only models consistently exhibiting performance improvements, at\ntimes even surpassing fine-tuned models when provided with certain few-shot\ndemonstrations through in-context learning. Finally, we analyze when the LLMs\nfail in NL2Vis, and propose to iteratively update the results using strategies\nsuch as chain-of-thought, role-playing, and code-interpreter. The experimental\nresults confirm the efficacy of iterative updates and hold great potential for\nfuture study.",

    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language\nprocessing that involves identifying and classifying entities in sentences into\npre-defined types. It plays a crucial role in various research fields,\nincluding entity linking, question answering, and online product\nrecommendation. Recent studies have shown that incorporating multilingual and\nmultimodal datasets can enhance the effectiveness of NER. This is due to\nlanguage transfer learning and the presence of shared implicit features across\ndifferent modalities. However, the lack of a dataset that combines\nmultilingualism and multimodality has hindered research exploring the\ncombination of these two aspects, as multimodality can help NER in multiple\nlanguages simultaneously. In this paper, we aim to address a more challenging\ntask: multilingual and multimodal named entity recognition (MMNER), considering\nits potential value and influence. Specifically, we construct a large-scale\nMMNER dataset with four languages (English, French, German and Spanish) and two\nmodalities (text and image). To tackle this challenging MMNER task on the\ndataset, we introduce a new model called 2M-NER, which aligns the text and\nimage representations using contrastive learning and integrates a multimodal\ncollaboration module to effectively depict the interactions between the two\nmodalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves\nthe highest F1 score in multilingual and multimodal NER tasks compared to some\ncomparative and representative baselines. Additionally, in a challenging\nanalysis, we discovered that sentence-level alignment interferes a lot with NER\nmodels, indicating the higher level of difficulty in our dataset.",

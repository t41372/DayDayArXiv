      "abstract": "The BrowserGym ecosystem addresses the growing need for efficient evaluation\nand benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging automation and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Many existing benchmarks suffer from\nfragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging\nto achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. In an earlier work,\nDrouin et al. (2024) introduced BrowserGym which aims to solve this by\nproviding a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and\naction spaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks.\nWe propose an extended BrowserGym-based ecosystem for web agent research, which\nunifies existing benchmarks from the literature and includes AgentLab, a\ncomplementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis. Our\nproposed ecosystem offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while\nensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. As a\nsupporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web\nagent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across\n6 popular web agent benchmarks made available in BrowserGym. Among other\nfindings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and\nAnthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost\nall benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior.\nDespite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and\nefficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent\ncomplexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current\nmodels.",

      "abstract": "The tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where\nindividual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes,\nthreatening the sustainability of shared resources. Strategies to escape this\ndilemma, however, are in short supply. In this study, we explore how artificial\nintelligence (AI) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public\ngoods games, moving beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using AI as\nfacilitators of cooperation. We investigate three scenarios: (1) Mandatory\nCooperation Policy for AI Agents, where AI agents are institutionally mandated\nalways to cooperate; (2) Player-Controlled Agent Cooperation Policy, where\nplayers evolve control over AI agents' likelihood to cooperate; and (3) Agents\nMimic Players, where AI agents copy the behavior of players. Using a\ncomputational evolutionary model with a population of agents playing public\ngoods games, we find that only when AI agents mimic player behavior does the\ncritical synergy threshold for cooperation decrease, effectively resolving the\ndilemma. This suggests that we can leverage AI to promote collective well-being\nin societal dilemmas by designing AI agents to mimic human players.",

      "abstract": "AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong\ncapabilities in problem solving. Through combining many intelligent agents,\nmulti-agent collaboration has emerged as a promising approach to tackle\ncomplex, multi-faceted problems that exceed the capabilities of single AI\nagents. However, designing the collaboration protocols and evaluating the\neffectiveness of these systems remains a significant challenge, especially for\nenterprise applications. This report addresses these challenges by presenting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of coordination and routing capabilities in a novel\nmulti-agent collaboration framework. We evaluate two key operational modes: (1)\na coordination mode enabling complex task completion through parallel\ncommunication and payload referencing, and (2) a routing mode for efficient\nmessage forwarding between agents. We benchmark on a set of handcrafted\nscenarios from three enterprise domains, which are publicly released with the\nreport. For coordination capabilities, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninter-agent communication and payload referencing mechanisms, achieving\nend-to-end goal success rates of 90%. Our analysis yields several key findings:\nmulti-agent collaboration enhances goal success rates by up to 70% compared to\nsingle-agent approaches in our benchmarks; payload referencing improves\nperformance on code-intensive tasks by 23%; latency can be substantially\nreduced with a routing mechanism that selectively bypasses agent orchestration.\nThese findings offer valuable guidance for enterprise deployments of\nmulti-agent systems and advance the development of scalable, efficient\nmulti-agent collaboration frameworks.",

Traditional AOI segmentation\nalgorithms primarily rely on road networks to partition urban areas. While\npromising in modeling the geo-semantics, road network-based models overlooked\nthe service-semantic goals (e.g., workload equality) in LBS service. In this\npaper, we point out that the AOI segmentation problem can be naturally\nformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which gradually chooses a nearby\nAOI for each grid in the current AOI's border. Based on the MDP, we present the\nfirst attempt to generalize Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for AOI\nsegmentation, leading to a novel DRL-based framework called DRL4AOI. The\nDRL4AOI framework introduces different service-semantic goals in a flexible way\nby treating them as rewards that guide the AOI generation. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of DRL4AOI, we develop and release an AOI segmentation system. We\nalso present a representative implementation of DRL4AOI - TrajRL4AOI - for AOI\nsegmentation in the logistics service. It introduces a Double Deep Q-learning\nNetwork (DDQN) to gradually optimize the AOI generation for two specific\nsemantic goals: i) trajectory modularity, i.e., maximize tightness of the\ntrajectory connections within an AOI and the sparsity of connections between\nAOIs, ii) matchness with the road network, i.e., maximizing the matchness\nbetween AOIs and the road network. Quantitative and qualitative experiments\nconducted on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our method.

      "abstract": "While imitation learning (IL) offers a promising framework for teaching\nrobots various behaviors, learning complex tasks remains challenging. Existing\nIL policies struggle to generalize effectively across visual and spatial\nvariations even for simple tasks. In this work, we introduce SPHINX: Salient\nPoint-based Hybrid ImitatioN and eXecution, a flexible IL policy that leverages\nmultimodal observations (point clouds and wrist images), along with a hybrid\naction space of low-frequency, sparse waypoints and high-frequency, dense end\neffector movements. Given 3D point cloud observations, SPHINX learns to infer\ntask-relevant points within a point cloud, or salient points, which support\nspatial generalization by focusing on semantically meaningful features. These\nsalient points serve as anchor points to predict waypoints for long-range\nmovement, such as reaching target poses in free-space. Once near a salient\npoint, SPHINX learns to switch to predicting dense end-effector movements given\nclose-up wrist images for precise phases of a task. By exploiting the strengths\nof different input modalities and action representations for different\nmanipulation phases, SPHINX tackles complex tasks in a sample-efficient,\ngeneralizable manner. Our method achieves 86.7% success across 4 real-world and\n2 simulated tasks, outperforming the next best state-of-the-art IL baseline by\n41.1% on average across 440 real world trials. SPHINX additionally generalizes\nto novel viewpoints, visual distractors, spatial arrangements, and execution\nspeeds with a 1.7x speedup over the most competitive baseline.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nSpatial-Temporal simulAtion for drivinG (Stag-1) model to reconstruct\nreal-world scenes and design a controllable generative network to achieve 4D\nsimulation. Stag-1 constructs continuous 4D point cloud scenes using\nsurround-view data from autonomous vehicles. It decouples spatial-temporal\nrelationships and produces coherent keyframe videos. Additionally, Stag-1\nleverages video generation models to obtain photo-realistic and controllable 4D\ndriving simulation videos from any perspective. To expand the range of view\ngeneration, we train vehicle motion videos based on decomposed camera poses,\nenhancing modeling capabilities for distant scenes. Furthermore, we reconstruct\nvehicle camera trajectories to integrate 3D points across consecutive views,\nenabling comprehensive scene understanding along the temporal dimension.\nFollowing extensive multi-level scene training, Stag-1 can simulate from any\ndesired viewpoint and achieve a deep understanding of scene evolution under\nstatic spatial-temporal conditions.

This memory burden\nnecessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting\ntraining scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient\noptimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they\nface critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii)\nsignificant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still\nsubstantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.\n  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be\neffectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this\ninsight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM\nOptimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an\nauxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This\nstructured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further\nmemory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even\nits rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance\ncompared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with\nor better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly\neliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant\nsystem-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB\nsetup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model\nScalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without\nsystem-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training\nLLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight\nquantization.",

While early work has shown that\nML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low\naccuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As\nmulti-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the\nunderlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by\nthe accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use\ndifferent strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for\nbuilding highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse\nsources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling\nstrategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which\nalready by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through\nexperiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits,\nwe show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to\nthe good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the\nscalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level\norganic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of\nquality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal\ndataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization\nunder distribution shift.

This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design\nchoices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We\npropose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final\nclassification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based\npre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as\na baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty:\nSpectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural\nNetworks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source\nfoundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in\ncertainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference\nphases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification\nmaintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances\nwithin the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact\ndoes not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty\nquantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty\nquantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in\npredictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This\nfacilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of\ndark-patterns on user interfaces.

Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this\neffort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential\ninput? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based\ntokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the\nspace of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the\ninput time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and\nfinally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the\nforecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs,\nwavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting\nthat simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark,\nincluding 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that\nWaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models\nfor forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and\nperforms on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically\non each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities,\nachieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary\nmetrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex\ntemporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent\npre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time\nseries with varying frequencies evolving over time.",

Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging\nmultiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than\nbeing captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world\napplications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting\nnatural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant\nchallenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract\ninformation or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that\nexisting training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks\n(e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality\nimage-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only\navailable for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions\n(CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nautomation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using\nCompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs\nacross six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by\nsupervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and\nLLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge\nresults on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and\nprocessing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources\nextremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model\nbinarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However,\nbinarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting\ngradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit\nmechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these\nissues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the\nfirst-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit\nwith binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process\nthrough a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function.\nThis enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the\nmagnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the\nproposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among\nintermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While\nbinarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces\nthe FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98%\nthrough resolving the \"overthinking\" problem inherent in deep networks.\nMoreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring\nknowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM. Extensive evaluation on the\nGLUE dataset and comparison with the SOTA works showcase its pareto-optimal\nperformance-efficiency trade-off.",

      "abstract": "Much effort has been made to explain and improve the success of\ntransfer-based attacks (TBA) on black-box computer vision models. This work\nprovides the first attempt at a priori prediction of attack success by\nidentifying the presence of vulnerable features within target models. Recent\nwork by Chen and Liu (2024) proposed the manifold attack model, a unifying\nframework proposing that successful TBA exist in a common manifold space. Our\nwork experimentally tests the common manifold space hypothesis by a new\nmethodology: first, projecting feature vectors from surrogate and target\nfeature extractors trained on ImageNet onto the same low-dimensional manifold;\nsecond, quantifying any observed structure similarities on the manifold; and\nfinally, by relating these observed similarities to the success of the TBA. We\nfind that shared feature representation moderately correlates with increased\nsuccess of TBA (\\r{ho}= 0.56). This method may be used to predict whether an\nattack will transfer without information of the model weights, training,\narchitecture or details of the attack. The results confirm the presence of\nshared feature representations between two feature extractors of different\nsizes and complexities, and demonstrate the utility of datasets from different\ntarget domains as test signals for interpreting black-box feature\nrepresentations.",

It comes with a formal guarantee on the number of search steps (node\nvisits) for finding a solution node that depends on the quality of the policy.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new algorithm, called $\\sqrt{\\text{LTS}}$\n(pronounce root-LTS), which implicitly starts an LTS search rooted at every\nnode of the search tree. Each LTS search is assigned a rerooting weight by a\n(user-defined or learnt) rerooter, and the search effort is shared between all\nLTS searches proportionally to their weights. The rerooting mechanism\nimplicitly decomposes the search space into subtasks, leading to significant\nspeedups. We prove that the number of node visits that $\\sqrt{\\text{LTS}}$\ntakes is competitive with the best decomposition into subtasks, at the price of\na factor that relates to the uncertainty of the rerooter. If LTS takes time\n$T$, in the best case with $q$ rerooting points, $\\sqrt{\\text{LTS}}$ only takes\ntime $O(q\\sqrt[q]{T})$.

      "abstract": "Recently, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising\nmethod to improve generalization by minimizing sharpness, which is known to\ncorrelate well with generalization ability. Since the original proposal of SAM,\nmany variants of SAM have been proposed to improve its accuracy and efficiency,\nbut comparisons have mainly been restricted to the i.i.d. setting. In this\npaper we study SAM for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. First, we\nperform a comprehensive comparison of eight SAM variants on zero-shot OOD\ngeneralization, finding that the original SAM outperforms the Adam baseline by\n$4.76\\%$ and the strongest SAM variants outperform the Adam baseline by\n$8.01\\%$ on average. We then provide an OOD generalization bound in terms of\nsharpness for this setting. Next, we extend our study of SAM to the related\nsetting of gradual domain adaptation (GDA), another form of OOD generalization\nwhere intermediate domains are constructed between the source and target\ndomains, and iterative self-training is done on intermediate domains, to\nimprove the overall target domain error. In this setting, our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the original SAM outperforms the baseline of Adam on\neach of the experimental datasets by $0.82\\%$ on average and the strongest SAM\nvariants outperform Adam by $1.52\\%$ on average. We then provide a\ngeneralization bound for SAM in the GDA setting. Asymptotically, this\ngeneralization bound is no better than the one for self-training in the\nliterature of GDA. This highlights a further disconnection between the\ntheoretical justification for SAM versus its empirical performance, with recent\nwork finding that low sharpness alone does not account for all of SAM's\ngeneralization benefits. For future work, we provide several potential avenues\nfor obtaining a tighter analysis for SAM in the OOD setting.",

However,\ngiven these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance\nof LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent\ncurrently. To address this gap, we propose an Audio Dialogue Understanding\nBenchmark (ADU-Bench), which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the\nopen-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills,\n9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling.

In summary, ADU-Bench includes\nover 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through\nextensive experiments conducted on 13 LALMs, our analysis reveals that there is\nstill considerable room for improvement in the audio dialogue understanding\nabilities of existing LALMs. In particular, they struggle with mathematical\nsymbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay,\ncomprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from\ndifferent phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and\nhomophones.",

      "abstract": "While remarkable success has been achieved through diffusion-based 3D\ngenerative models for shapes, 4D generative modeling remains challenging due to\nthe complexity of object deformations over time. We propose DNF, a new 4D\nrepresentation for unconditional generative modeling that efficiently models\ndeformable shapes with disentangled shape and motion while capturing\nhigh-fidelity details in the deforming objects. To achieve this, we propose a\ndictionary learning approach to disentangle 4D motion from shape as neural\nfields. Both shape and motion are represented as learned latent spaces, where\neach deformable shape is represented by its shape and motion global latent\ncodes, shape-specific coefficient vectors, and shared dictionary information.\nThis captures both shape-specific detail and global shared information in the\nlearned dictionary. Our dictionary-based representation well balances fidelity,\ncontiguity and compression -- combined with a transformer-based diffusion\nmodel, our method is able to generate effective, high-fidelity 4D animations.",

This alignment\nensures that the embeddings are semantically and syntactically meaningful for\nthe specific code translation task. Our methodology involves constructing a\ndataset of 25,000 Fortran code snippets sourced from Stack-V2 dataset and\ngenerating their corresponding C++ translations using the LLaMA 3.1-8B language\nmodel. We compute pairwise CodeBLEU scores between the generated translations\nand ground truth examples to capture fine-grained similarities. These scores\nserve as supervision signals in a contrastive learning framework, where we\noptimize the embedding model to retrieve Fortran-C++ pairs that are most\nbeneficial for improving the language model's translation performance. By\nintegrating these CodeBLEU-optimized embeddings into the RAG framework, our\napproach significantly enhances both retrieval accuracy and code generation\nquality over methods employing generic embeddings. On the HPC Fortran2C++\ndataset, our method elevates the average CodeBLEU score from 0.64 to 0.73,\nachieving a 14% relative improvement.

Recently, occupancy has emerged as a\npromising alternative for 3D scene perception. However, constructing a\nhigh-resolution occupancy map remains infeasible for large scenes due to\ncomputational constraints. Recognizing that foreground objects only occupy a\nsmall portion of the scene, we introduce object-centric occupancy as a\nsupplement to object bboxes. This representation not only provides intricate\ndetails for detected objects but also enables higher voxel resolution in\npractical applications. We advance the development of object-centric occupancy\nperception from both data and algorithm perspectives. On the data side, we\nconstruct the first object-centric occupancy dataset from scratch using an\nautomated pipeline. From the algorithmic standpoint, we introduce a novel\nobject-centric occupancy completion network equipped with an implicit shape\ndecoder that manages dynamic-size occupancy generation. This network accurately\npredicts the complete object-centric occupancy volume for inaccurate object\nproposals by leveraging temporal information from long sequences. Our method\ndemonstrates robust performance in completing object shapes under noisy\ndetection and tracking conditions.

While\nexperimentation with various prompting methods, such as Few-shot,\nChain-of-Thought, and role-based techniques, has yielded promising results,\nthese advancements remain fragmented across academic papers, blog posts and\nanecdotal experimentation. The lack of a single, unified resource to\nconsolidate the field's knowledge impedes the progress of both research and\npractical application. This paper argues for the creation of an overarching\nframework that synthesizes existing methodologies into a cohesive overview for\npractitioners.

By combining\nthe conceptual foundations and practical strategies identified in prompt\nengineering, the Prompt Canvas provides a practical approach for leveraging the\npotential of Large Language Models. It is primarily designed as a learning\nresource for pupils, students and employees, offering a structured introduction\nto prompt engineering.

In each simulation condition, two sets of ACT-R parameters\nwere assumed from the different interpretations of the human experimental\nsettings.

      "abstract": "There have been several efforts in backdoor attacks, but these have primarily\nfocused on the closed-set performance of classifiers (i.e., classification).\nThis has left a gap in addressing the threat to classifiers' open-set\nperformance, referred to as outlier detection in the literature. Reliable\noutlier detection is crucial for deploying classifiers in critical real-world\napplications such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. First, we\nshow that existing backdoor attacks fall short in affecting the open-set\nperformance of classifiers, as they have been specifically designed to confuse\nintra-closed-set decision boundaries. In contrast, an effective backdoor attack\nfor outlier detection needs to confuse the decision boundary between the closed\nand open sets. Motivated by this, in this study, we propose BATOD, a novel\nBackdoor Attack targeting the Outlier Detection task. Specifically, we design\ntwo categories of triggers to shift inlier samples to outliers and vice versa.\nWe evaluate BATOD using various real-world datasets and demonstrate its\nsuperior ability to degrade the open-set performance of classifiers compared to\nprevious attacks, both before and after applying defenses.",

      "abstract": "Road anomalies can be defined as irregularities on the road surface or in the\nsurface itself. Some may be intentional (such as speedbumps), accidental (such\nas materials falling off a truck), or the result of roads' excessive use or low\nor no maintenance, such as potholes. Despite their varying origins, these\nirregularities often harm vehicles substantially. Speed bumps are intentionally\nplaced for safety but are dangerous due to their non-standard shape, size, and\nlack of proper markings. Potholes are unintentional and can also cause severe\ndamage. To address the detection of these anomalies, we need an automated road\nmonitoring system. Today, various systems exist that use visual information to\ntrack these anomalies. Still, due to poor lighting conditions and improper or\nmissing markings, they may go undetected and have severe consequences for\npublic transport, automated vehicles, etc. In this paper, the Enhanced\nTemporal-BiLSTM Network (ETLNet) is introduced as a novel approach that\nintegrates two Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) layers with a Bidirectional\nLong Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer. This combination is tailored to detect\nanomalies effectively irrespective of lighting conditions, as it depends not on\nvisuals but smartphone inertial sensor data. Our methodology employs\naccelerometer and gyroscope sensors, typically in smartphones, to gather data\non road conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the ETLNet model\nmaintains an F1-score for detecting speed bumps of 99.3%.

We\nstudy whether models have the capability to scheme in pursuit of a goal that we\nprovide in-context and instruct the model to strongly follow. We evaluate\nfrontier models on a suite of six agentic evaluations where models are\ninstructed to pursue goals and are placed in environments that incentivize\nscheming. Our results show that o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini\n1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.1 405B all demonstrate in-context scheming capabilities.\nThey recognize scheming as a viable strategy and readily engage in such\nbehavior. For example, models strategically introduce subtle mistakes into\ntheir responses, attempt to disable their oversight mechanisms, and even\nexfiltrate what they believe to be their model weights to external servers.\nAdditionally, this deceptive behavior proves persistent. When o1 has engaged in\nscheming, it maintains its deception in over 85% of follow-up questions and\noften remains deceptive in multi-turn interrogations. Analysis of the models'\nchains-of-thought reveals that models explicitly reason about these deceptive\nstrategies, providing evidence that the scheming behavior is not accidental.\nSurprisingly, we also find rare instances where models engage in scheming when\nonly given a goal, without being strongly nudged to pursue it. We observe cases\nwhere Claude 3.5 Sonnet strategically underperforms in evaluations in pursuit\nof being helpful, a goal that was acquired during training rather than\nin-context. Our findings demonstrate that frontier models now possess\ncapabilities for basic in-context scheming, making the potential of AI agents\nto engage in scheming behavior a concrete rather than theoretical concern.",

To solve the\nnontrivial task of selecting samples, which on one hand reflect the DRL agent's\ncapabilities of choosing the right action but on the other hand also cover\nenough state space to generalize well, we developed an algorithm to iteratively\ntrain DTs.\n  In this short paper, we apply this algorithm to a real-world implementation\nof a robotic task for the first time.

As an\nevaluation target, we employed the \"Murder Mystery\" game, a reasoning-type\ntable-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and\ninformation manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of\nthe case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining.\nThe proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency\npairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into\naccount to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the\neffectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue\nbreakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human\nevaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game.\nExperimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker\nselection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the\nability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The\nresults of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human\nconversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and\nprovide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.",

Although often derived from\ninternet text, recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of\nbehavior-based (e.g., free associations) and brain-based (e.g., fMRI)\nrepresentations, which promise improvements in our ability to measure and model\nhuman representations. We carry out the first systematic evaluation of the\nsimilarities and differences between semantic representations derived from\ntext, behavior, and brain data. Using representational similarity analysis, we\nshow that word vectors derived from behavior and brain data encode information\nthat differs from their text-derived cousins. Furthermore, drawing on our\npsychNorms metabase, alongside an interpretability method that we call\nrepresentational content analysis, we find that, in particular, behavior\nrepresentations capture unique variance on certain affective, agentic, and\nsocio-moral dimensions. We thus establish behavior as an important complement\nto text for capturing human representations and behavior. These results are\nbroadly relevant to research aimed at learning human-aligned semantic\nrepresentations, including work on evaluating and aligning large language\nmodels.",

Traditional pixel-wise and regression-based\nmethods primarily encounter difficulties in precise segmentation and lack of\ngeometrical grounding respectively. To address these shortcomings, our\nmethodology refines the segmentation by predicting a signed distance function\n(SDF) that effectively parameterizes the retinal layer shape via level set. We\nfurther enhance the framework by integrating probabilistic modeling, applying\nGaussian distributions to encapsulate the uncertainty in the shape\nparameterization. This ensures a robust representation of the retinal layer\nmorphology even in the presence of ambiguous input, imaging noise, and\nunreliable segmentations. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations\ndemonstrate superior performance when compared to other methods. Additionally,\nwe conducted experiments on artificially distorted datasets with various noise\ntypes-shadowing, blinking, speckle, and motion-common in OCT scans to showcase\nthe effectiveness of our uncertainty estimation. Our findings demonstrate the\npossibility to obtain reliable segmentation of retinal layers, as well as an\ninitial step towards the characterization of layer integrity, a key biomarker\nfor disease progression.

Existing measures of AI occupational exposure largely\nfocus on AI's theoretical potential to substitute or complement human labour on\nthe basis of technical feasibility, providing limited insight into actual\nadoption and offering inadequate guidance for policymakers. To address this\ngap, we introduce the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index-a novel metric based on\noccupational descriptions from O*NET and AI applications developed by startups\nfunded by the Y Combinator accelerator. Our findings indicate that while\nhigh-skilled professions are theoretically highly exposed according to\nconventional metrics, they are heterogeneously targeted by startups. Roles\ninvolving routine organizational tasks-such as data analysis and office\nmanagement-display significant exposure, while occupations involving tasks that\nare less amenable to AI automation due to ethical or high-stakes, more than\nfeasibility, considerations -- such as judges or surgeons -- present lower AISE\nscores. By focusing on venture-backed AI applications, our approach offers a\nnuanced perspective on how AI is reshaping the labour market. It challenges the\nconventional assumption that high-skilled jobs uniformly face high AI risks,\nhighlighting instead the role of today's AI players' societal\ndesirability-driven and market-oriented choices as critical determinants of AI\nexposure. Contrary to fears of widespread job displacement, our findings\nsuggest that AI adoption will be gradual and shaped by social factors as much\nas by the technical feasibility of AI applications.

Specifically, with the protection from TEE, data owners can achieve\nefficient model training with high-performance AI services in the cloud.

      "abstract": "Integrating invariance into data representations is a principled design in\nintelligent systems and web applications. Representations play a fundamental\nrole, where systems and applications are both built on meaningful\nrepresentations of digital inputs (rather than the raw data). In fact, the\nproper design/learning of such representations relies on priors w.r.t. the task\nof interest. Here, the concept of symmetry from the Erlangen Program may be the\nmost fruitful prior -- informally, a symmetry of a system is a transformation\nthat leaves a certain property of the system invariant. Symmetry priors are\nubiquitous, e.g., translation as a symmetry of the object classification, where\nobject category is invariant under translation. The quest for invariance is as\nold as pattern recognition and data mining itself. Invariant design has been\nthe cornerstone of various representations in the era before deep learning,\nsuch as the SIFT. As we enter the early era of deep learning, the invariance\nprinciple is largely ignored and replaced by a data-driven paradigm, such as\nthe CNN. However, this neglect did not last long before they encountered\nbottlenecks regarding robustness, interpretability, efficiency, and so on. The\ninvariance principle has returned in the era of rethinking deep learning,\nforming a new field known as Geometric Deep Learning (GDL). In this tutorial,\nwe will give a historical perspective of the invariance in data\nrepresentations.

      "abstract": "Currently, state-of-the-art RL methods excel in single-task settings, but\nthey still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to catastrophic\nforgetting challenges, where previously learned tasks are forgotten as new\ntasks are introduced. This multi-task learning capability is significantly\nimportant for generalist agents, where adaptation features are highly required\n(e.g., autonomous robots). On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)\nhave emerged as alternative energy-efficient neural network algorithms due to\ntheir sparse spike-based operations. Toward this, we propose MTSpark, a novel\nmethodology to enable multi-task RL using spiking networks. Specifically,\nMTSpark develops a Deep Spiking Q-Network (DSQN) with active dendrites and\ndueling structure by leveraging task-specific context signals. Specifically,\neach neuron computes task-dependent activations that dynamically modulate\ninputs, forming specialized sub-networks for each task. Moreover, this\nbioplausible network model also benefits from SNNs, enhancing energy efficiency\nand making the model suitable for hardware implementation. Experimental results\nshow that, our MTSpark effectively learns multiple tasks with higher\nperformance compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MTSpark\nsuccessfully achieves high score in three Atari games (i.e., Pong: -5.4,\nBreakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2), reaching human-level performance (i.e.,\nPong: -3, Breakout: 31, and Enduro: 368), where state-of-the-art struggle to\nachieve. In addition, our MTSpark also shows better accuracy in image\nclassification tasks than the state-of-the-art.

However, aligning\nthese policies with end-user preferences remains a challenge, particularly when\nthe preferences are hard to specify. While reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in\nnon-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same\nsuccess in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human\nfeedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation,\nwe propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an\nobservation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less\nhuman preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback\non fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual\nrepresentation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching\nin this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation\nexperiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation,\ndemonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more\nefficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments.\nFinally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for\nthree object manipulation tasks. We find that RAPL can fine-tune these policies\nwith 5x less real human preference data, taking the first step towards\nminimizing human feedback while maximizing visuomotor robot policy alignment.",

      "abstract": "Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and\noptimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an\neffective channel modeling approach has been a long-standing challenge. This\nissue has been escalated due to denser network deployment, larger antenna\narrays, and broader bandwidth in next-generation networks. To address this\nchallenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on\nwireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting\n(3D-GS). WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture\nthe interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient\nWRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The\nreconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for\ncomprehensive wireless channel characterization. While WRF-GS demonstrates\nremarkable effectiveness, it faces limitations in capturing high-frequency\nsignal variations caused by complex multipath effects. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose WRF-GS+, an enhanced framework that integrates\nelectromagnetic wave physics into the neural network design. WRF-GS+ leverages\ndeformable 3D Gaussians to model both static and dynamic components of the WRF,\nsignificantly improving its ability to characterize signal variations. In\naddition, WRF-GS+ enhances the splatting process by simplifying the 3D-GS\nmodeling process and improving computational efficiency. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that both WRF-GS and WRF-GS+ outperform baselines for spatial\nspectrum synthesis, including ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches.\nNotably, WRF-GS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance in the received signal\nstrength indication (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI) prediction\ntasks, surpassing existing methods by more than 0.7 dB and 3.36 dB,\nrespectively.",

While recent work has shown\ngreat potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the\nprompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with\ntime series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage\nword token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by\nLLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt\nwhich utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the\ncharacteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose\nNNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting\nvia LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that\neach text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood\nand time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw\ninspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt\nwhile obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text\nprototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings\nof the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters\nand decreasing the computational cost.

By analyzing\npatterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human\nactions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall\ndetection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where\neven minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This\nsensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when\napplying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To\naddress this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for\ncross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global\ndistributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its\npopularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to\nmisalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is\nachieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum\nMean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless\nsensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the\ntarget domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains\nwithin each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability\nissue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance\nfluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to\ndetermine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of\nlabeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the\nsupport set from the target domain during training and employing it as a\nvalidation set to determine the stopping criterion.",

      "abstract": "Infrared (IR) imaging is commonly used in various scenarios, including\nautonomous driving, fire safety and defense applications. Thus, semantic\nsegmentation of such images is of great interest. However, this task faces\nseveral challenges, including data scarcity, differing contrast and input\nchannel number compared to natural images, and emergence of classes not\nrepresented in databases in certain scenarios, such as defense applications.\nFew-shot segmentation (FSS) provides a framework to overcome these issues by\nsegmenting query images using a few labeled support samples. However, existing\nFSS models for IR images require paired visible RGB images, which is a major\nlimitation since acquiring such paired data is difficult or impossible in some\napplications. In this work, we develop new strategies for FSS of IR images by\nusing generative modeling and fusion techniques. To this end, we propose to\nsynthesize auxiliary data to provide additional channel information to\ncomplement the limited contrast in the IR images, as well as IR data synthesis\nfor data augmentation. Here, the former helps the FSS model to better capture\nthe relationship between the support and query sets, while the latter addresses\nthe issue of data scarcity. Finally, to further improve the former aspect, we\npropose a novel fusion ensemble module for integrating the two different\nmodalities.

Instead of depending solely on extrinsic rewards from\nthe environments, existing methods use intrinsic rewards to enhance\nexploration. However, we demonstrate that these methods are vulnerable to Noisy\nTV and stochasticity. To tackle this problem, we propose Temporally Correlated\nLatent Exploration (TeCLE), which is a novel intrinsic reward formulation that\nemploys an action-conditioned latent space and temporal correlation. The\naction-conditioned latent space estimates the probability distribution of\nstates, thereby avoiding the assignment of excessive intrinsic rewards to\nunpredictable states and effectively addressing both problems. Whereas previous\nworks inject temporal correlation for action selection, the proposed method\ninjects it for intrinsic reward computation. We find that the injected temporal\ncorrelation determines the exploratory behaviors of agents. Various experiments\nshow that the environment where the agent performs well depends on the amount\nof temporal correlation. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed TeCLE is\nthe first approach to consider the action conditioned latent space and temporal\ncorrelation for curiosity-driven exploration.

To address this gap, we introduce BESSTIE, a benchmark for\nsentiment and sarcasm classification for three varieties of English: Australian\n(en-AU), Indian (en-IN), and British (en-UK). Using web-based content from two\ndomains, namely, Google Place reviews and Reddit comments, we collect datasets\nfor these language varieties using two methods: location-based and topic-based\nfiltering. Native speakers of the language varieties manually annotate the\ndatasets with sentiment and sarcasm labels. To assess whether the dataset\naccurately represents these varieties, we conduct two validation steps: (a)\nmanual annotation of language varieties and (b) automatic language variety\nprediction. Subsequently, we fine-tune nine large language models (LLMs)\n(representing a range of encoder/decoder and mono/multilingual models) on these\ndatasets, and evaluate their performance on the two tasks. Our results reveal\nthat the models consistently perform better on inner-circle varieties (i.e.,\nen-AU and en-UK), with significant performance drops for en-IN, particularly in\nsarcasm detection. We also report challenges in cross-variety generalisation,\nhighlighting the need for language variety-specific datasets such as ours.\nBESSTIE promises to be a useful evaluative benchmark for future research in\nequitable LLMs, specifically in terms of language varieties.

While unsupervised\ntechniques leveraging Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML)\nmethods have been widely used for predicting trace links, their effectiveness\nremains underexplored. In particular, these techniques often assume\ntraceability patterns are present within textual data - a premise that may not\nhold universally. Moreover, standard evaluation metrics such as precision,\nrecall, accuracy, or F1 measure can misrepresent the model performance when\nunderlying data distributions are not properly analyzed. Given that automated\ntraceability techniques tend to struggle to establish links, we need further\ninsight into the information limits related to traceability artifacts. In this\npaper, we propose an approach, TraceXplainer, for using information theory\nmetrics to evaluate and better understand the performance (limits) of\nunsupervised traceability techniques. Specifically, we introduce\nself-information, cross-entropy, and mutual information (MI) as metrics to\nmeasure the informativeness and reliability of traceability links.

This application of TraceXplainer illustrates\nan imbalance in typical traceability datasets where the source code has on\naverage 1.48 more information bits (i.e., entropy) than the linked\ndocumentation. Additionally, we demonstrate that an average MI of 4.81 bits,\nloss of 1.75, and noise of 0.28 bits signify that there are\ninformation-theoretic limits on the effectiveness of unsupervised traceability\ntechniques.

It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data,\ninsufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer\narchitecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem\nas a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train\nsmall transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find\nthat, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to\nlearn to search.\n  We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel\nmechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the\ncomputation graph from the trained model. We find that transformers perform\nsearch at every vertex in parallel: For each vertex in the input graph,\ntransformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer\nthen progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a\nnumber of vertices exponential in $n_{\\text{layers}}$.\n  However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has\ngreater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even\nas the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model\nscale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing\nsearch in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to\nlearn to search on larger graphs.",

      "abstract": "With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there\nhas been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly\nsensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists\nLLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge\nsources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking\nsensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore\nRAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The\nmain challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate\nanswers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an\nalgorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require\nthe sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our\nextensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the\nnon-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\\epsilon\\approx 10$\nacross different models and datasets.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where LLM\ninputs may span many different tasks. Recent work has found that the choice of\nLLM is consequential, and different LLMs may be good for different input\nsamples. Prior approaches have thus explored how engineers might select an LLM\nto use for each sample (i.e. routing). While existing routing methods mostly\nrequire training auxiliary models on human-annotated data, our work explores\nwhether it is possible to perform unsupervised routing. We propose Smoothie, a\nweak supervision-inspired routing approach that requires no labeled data. Given\na set of outputs from different LLMs, Smoothie constructs a latent variable\ngraphical model over embedding representations of observable LLM outputs and\nunknown \"true\" outputs. Using this graphical model, we estimate\nsample-dependent quality scores for each LLM, and route each sample to the LLM\nwith the highest corresponding score. We find that Smoothie's LLM\nquality-scores correlate with ground-truth model quality (correctly identifying\nthe optimal model on 9/14 tasks), and that Smoothie outperforms baselines for\nrouting by up to 10 points accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Entity Alignment (EA) seeks to identify and match corresponding entities\nacross different Knowledge Graphs (KGs), playing a crucial role in knowledge\nfusion and integration. Embedding-based entity alignment (EA) has recently\ngained considerable attention, resulting in the emergence of many innovative\napproaches. Initially, these approaches concentrated on learning entity\nembeddings based on the structural features of knowledge graphs (KGs) as\ndefined by relation triples. Subsequent methods have integrated entities' names\nand attributes as supplementary information to improve the embeddings used for\nEA. However, existing methods lack a deep semantic understanding of entity\nattributes and relations. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model\n(LLM) based Entity Alignment method, LLM-Align, which explores the\ninstruction-following and zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models to\ninfer alignments of entities. LLM-Align uses heuristic methods to select\nimportant attributes and relations of entities, and then feeds the selected\ntriples of entities to an LLM to infer the alignment results. To guarantee the\nquality of alignment results, we design a multi-round voting mechanism to\nmitigate the hallucination and positional bias issues that occur with LLMs.\nExperiments on three EA datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to existing EA methods.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enable the\nunsupervised machine learning (ML) prediction for target data, thus this will\naccelerate real world applications with ML models such as image recognition\ntasks in self-driving. Researchers have reported the UDA techniques are not\nworking well under large co-variate shift problems where e.g. supervised source\ndata consists of handwritten digits data in monotone color and unsupervised\ntarget data colored digits data from the street view. Thus there is a need for\na method to resolve co-variate shift and transfer source labelling rules under\nthis dynamics. We perform two stages domain invariant representation learning\nto bridge the gap between source and target with semantic intermediate data\n(unsupervised). The proposed method can learn domain invariant features\nsimultaneously between source and intermediate also intermediate and target.\nFinally this achieves good domain invariant representation between source and\ntarget plus task discriminability owing to source labels. This induction for\nthe gradient descent search greatly eases learning convergence in terms of\nclassification performance for target data even when large co-variate shift. We\nalso derive a theorem for measuring the gap between trained models and\nunsupervised target labelling rules, which is necessary for the free parameters\noptimization. Finally we demonstrate that proposing method is superiority to\nprevious UDA methods using 4 representative ML classification datasets\nincluding 38 UDA tasks.

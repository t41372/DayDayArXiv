    "abstract": "We present Large Inverse Rendering Model (LIRM), a transformer architecture\nthat jointly reconstructs high-quality shape, materials, and radiance fields\nwith view-dependent effects in less than a second. Our model builds upon the\nrecent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art\nsparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to\nreconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or\ngenerate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics\nengines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical\ncontributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework.\nFirst, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more\ninput views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane\nneural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and\nmaterial parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding\nmechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and\nmaterial dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model\nachieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based\ndense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting\naccuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning\nresearch including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining,\netc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual\nconsistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning\nparadigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward\nnew-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three\ninterdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular\nreasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,\nmitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and\ntransparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the\ninternal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic\ncomponents; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable\ninterpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible\nimplementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as\ndisentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and\nneuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the\nintegration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint\noptimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research\ndirections that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the\nMML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical\n(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for\nrobust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation\nsystems, yet accurately forecasting traffic remains challenging due to the\ninteraction between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Standard deep\nlearning models often struggle with these challenges because their\narchitectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing\non general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both\nbranches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit\nstatistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.\nNotably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by\ndirectly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully\nintegrating long-term trends.

    "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) agents become more common in enterprise settings,\nthey introduce security challenges that differ significantly from those posed\nby traditional systems. These agents are not just LLMs; they reason, remember,\nand act, often with minimal human oversight. This paper introduces a\ncomprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on\nhow their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool\nintegration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats\nand organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture\nvulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution\nvulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These\nthreats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as\ndelayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral\nmovement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing\nframeworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work\npresent two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for\nAutonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a\nframework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce\nenterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI\nsecurity, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those\ndifferences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require\na new lens for security.

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of aerodynamic coefficients is crucial for understanding\nand optimizing the performance of modern aircraft systems. This paper presents\nthe novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network\n(eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to\nexpress the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear\naircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based\nstructure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional\nbatch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and\ndata noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic\nrule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the\naerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different\nstudies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data\nand the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling\nperformance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts.\nFurthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared\nto Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the\nproposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are\nanalyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in\nrepresenting aerodynamic coefficients.",

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and\ncausal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\\ldots$ over finite domains,\nthe basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events\n$X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \\vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic\nterms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication\n(polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a\njoint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of\n(in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and\nlinear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean\nsatisfiability, while Moss\\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms,\nit is complete for the existential theory of the reals.\n  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with\ninterventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of\nlanguages. However, Moss\\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity\nremains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a\nmarginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in\ncomplexity.\n  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by\nconstraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying\nstructural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and\ngive a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels.\nSecond, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable\ninstances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with\ncompact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability\nunder small-model constraints across different settings.",

In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a\ncase composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case,\ninvolves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process\nrequests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most\nresearch is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the\nchallenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work\nproposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS.\nTo this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph\nstructure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP\nand a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of\nminimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two\nnovelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment\npolicies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP\ninstances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process\nmining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or\noutperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on\ndifferent time horizons and across instances.",

Previous studies\nhave shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer\ndetection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more\ncomprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical\nimaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with\nlarge-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view\nVisual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening\nmammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on\nhigh-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature\nlearning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively\ntunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\\%) while retaining the\nrobustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration\nof multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach\noffers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods,\nproviding a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution\nmammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while\nmaintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for\ndistinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes.

Our data-oblivious\nalgorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion\nrates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions.\nTurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a\nconcentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the\nnear-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply\napply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that\nMSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL\n(QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product\nquantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower\nbounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer,\ndemonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a\nsmall constant ($\\approx 2.7$) factor.

    "abstract": "This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically\ncharacterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite\nthe remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear\nwhat representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for\nvarious downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning\nis critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is\nproducing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is\nimperative for further progress.\n  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite\ndifferently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for\nanalyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also\nshow that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is\nneither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture\ntheory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing\nreturns, and further advancements require better contexts.\n  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture,\nincluding supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models,\netc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning\nthe contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an\neffortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove\nstatistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss\nthe effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream\ntask.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a transformative approach for\nenhancing large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external\nknowledge sources. Yet, a critical question persists: how can vast volumes of\nexternal knowledge be managed effectively within the input constraints of LLMs?\nTraditional methods address this by chunking external documents into smaller,\nfixed-size segments. While this approach alleviates input limitations, it often\nfragments context, resulting in incomplete retrieval and diminished coherence\nin generation. To overcome these shortcomings, two advanced techniques, late\nchunking and contextual retrieval, have been introduced, both aiming to\npreserve global context. Despite their potential, their comparative strengths\nand limitations remain unclear. This study presents a rigorous analysis of late\nchunking and contextual retrieval, evaluating their effectiveness and\nefficiency in optimizing RAG systems. Our results indicate that contextual\nretrieval preserves semantic coherence more effectively but requires greater\ncomputational resources. In contrast, late chunking offers higher efficiency\nbut tends to sacrifice relevance and completeness.",

    "abstract": "Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject\nto multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric\nvariations. Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making\nthe transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a\ncritical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling\ncertain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical\napproach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints.\nThis study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain\nrandomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic\nnetworks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the\nlatent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled\nsystem subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an\nenvironment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness\nof the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases\ntraining difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control\nsystem; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based\ncontroller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based\ncontrols, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a\nhigh level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network\narchitecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is\nverified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain\nsystem with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests\ndemonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across\nvarious domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that\ndemand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key\nlimitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability\n(provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language\nmodels with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming\nthese deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge\ngraph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs\nwith a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by\nconnecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of\ncorresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of\ntext through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from\nan initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach\nimplements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of\ntextual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance\nestimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids\ncommon challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity\nresolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge\ngraph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification\nproblem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach\non a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses\ngiven a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature. Experiments\nindicate that it can optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of\nLLM prompts while reducing their lengths, which may lead to reduced costs and\nmore consistent and reliable LLM outputs.",

It can be achieved through instruction set\nextensions and corresponding custom functional units. Yet, efficiently\nexploiting these opportunities requires a hardware/software co-design approach\nin which the DNN model, software, and hardware are designed together. In this\npaper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models\ncontaining semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of\naccelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design\noffers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured\nsparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of\nFPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the\ninformation about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom\nfunctional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit\nunstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential\nmultiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the\nnon-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured\npruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4,\nrespectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types\nof sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5.

    "abstract": "SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for\nrobotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and\nprevious trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable\nimprovements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry\nand pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in\nlarge complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent\nestimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map\nquality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and\nunclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps\naccording to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in\nexploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness\nfor specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes.\nTo address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy\nGrid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation\ntechniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map\nquality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data\ngeneration method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large\nenough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in\nreal-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its\ngeneralisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of\nlarge scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the\ncreation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the\ncapabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and\nreliability.",

    "abstract": "SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing\nrobots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment.\nSLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic\nmotion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D\nrepresentations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly\ndegrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks\nsuch as floor plan creation.

    "abstract": "- The field of natural language processing (NLP) has dramatically expanded\nwithin the last decade. Many human-being applications are conducted daily via\nNLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text\ngeneration and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity\nRecognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the\nCentral-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of\nnecessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the\nbase of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to\nstandardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the\nsentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation.\nSpecifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are\nneither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an\naccurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance\nof the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from\ndifferent studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized\npart-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large\nCKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this\nstudy via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard\nlanguages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct\nsentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods have shown promising performances in remote sensing\nimage change detection (CD). However, existing methods usually train a\ndataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant\ndifferences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the\ntrained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on\nother datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter\nnetwork (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains\ndataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the\ndiscriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter\nmodel, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data\ndistribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the\ndeep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this\npaper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which\ncan adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of\nlabeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch\nnormalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution\ndifferences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve\nsatisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental\nresults on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and\nadvantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization\nability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and\nbetter performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning\nmethods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.",

These agents collectively generate and refine\ndomain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and\nconsistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement.\nExtensive experimental results show that language models trained on our\nmulti-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical\nquestion-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines\nand advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables\nLlama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger\nscale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the\neffectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the\npotential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.",

The key idea is learning to identify quad mesh\nwith fused pointwise and facewise features. Specifically, Point2Quad begins\nwith a k-NN-based candidate generation considering the coplanarity and\nsquareness. Then, two encoders are followed to extract geometric and\ntopological features that address the challenge of quad-related constraints,\nespecially by combining in-depth quadrilaterals-specific characteristics.\nSubsequently, the extracted features are fused to train the classifier with a\ndesigned compound loss. The final results are derived after the refinement by a\nquad-specific post-processing.

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide\nunparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications,\nnecessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data\nrates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention\nof cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient\nradio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User\nEquipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach\nis developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best\nEffort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS\nand resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement\nLearning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process,\nwith states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both\nstate representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained\nusing an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based\narchitecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of\nnodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of\naccounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the\nGRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show\nsubstantial performance gains, including a $53\\%$ reduction in QoS violations\nand a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in\nincreasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason.\nWhether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is,\nhowever, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering\napproach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM\nwhen processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control\nvector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention,\nmodulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on\nthe specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and\nanalyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on\nreasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit\ndistribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply\ncontrol vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an\ninductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM\ncan, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning\nability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the\nability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a\ntask. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the\nsame manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and\ndemonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via\na simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.",

However, due to the variability of\ncoordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the\ntime-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well\nperformance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon\ncoordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define\nthe Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based\ncooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward\nfunction generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which\nsystematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven\ninitialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first\ninitializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements\nwith an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively\noptimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR\nmodule guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a\nchain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code\ngeneration. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward\nfunction, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence\nstability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging\ncoordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River\nDelta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results\ndemonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions\nconsistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average\nof 10\\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in\ngenerating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows\npose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged\nmulti-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric\narchitecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting,\nconsolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.\nBuilding on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that\nleverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational\nstructures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on\nLOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline\ncategories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context\napproach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source\nmemory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory\nmanagement platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently\noutperform all existing memory systems across four question categories:\nsingle-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26%\nrelative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with\ngraph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base\nconfiguration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational\noverhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91%\nlower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling\nbalance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment\nconstraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent\nmemory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for\nmore reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.",

    "abstract": "Semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction is essential for autonomous robots to\nperform complex interactions. Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates\npose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified\nframework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely\non 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity\nand noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this\nchallenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of\nappearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently\noptimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using\nvarious forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both\ntracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D\nground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation\nperformance with 95.03\\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\\times$ speedup with\nonly marginal performance degradation.",

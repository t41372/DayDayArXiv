    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how\nchain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.\nHowever, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel\nreasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a\nbi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT\nthat can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the\nsemantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the\ntoken-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch\ngeneration. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce\nBiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes\nboth generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning\nstrategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance\nwith 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE\nbenchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

    "abstract": "Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot\ninteraction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic\ncontrol introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel\nparadigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic\nrepresentation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into\nhuman-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,\ncircles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable\nrobots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we\npresent Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for\nRoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from\n2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable\n3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K\ninstances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to\neffectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated\nacross 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating\nsignificant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success\nrate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step\nactions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

    "abstract": "Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in\ndensely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where\nexposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one\nof the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues\ndue to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which\nexacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution\nmitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail\nto maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability\nto dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths\nto improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,\nto iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple\nspatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic\npatterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is\nbenchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and\ngreedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation\nmetrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic\nimpact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based\napproach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective\ndistribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework\nachieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage\ndeployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions.

Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is\na promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math\ncritique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too\nshallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and\nstruggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct\nmistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage\nframework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on\neach reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize\nQwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for\nsupervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise\ncritiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth\ncritiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform\nreinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing\nhuman-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained\nvia Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize\nits critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\nnot only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the\nsame-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error\nidentification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator\nrefine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.",

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks.

RT imaging\nenables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial\nalternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,\nECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine\nMRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,\nparticularly at high undersampling factors.

A deep learning (DL)\nmodel is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean\nouter volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding\nk-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL\n(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high\nspatio-temporal resolution images.

Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes\nmessages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is\ncrucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets\nstate-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such\nmethods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known\ntriggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the\nprocess of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.\nThrough a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that\nfine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task\ntype exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data\naugmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to\niterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose\nreinforcing \\emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting\ntoken-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating\nposition IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on\nsuperficial proxies.

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant\ncomputational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,\ndomain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.\nMedium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for\ndomain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation\nwhen tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for\nderiving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.\nFineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its\nability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract\ndomain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with\ndomain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain\nessential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,\nthese pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated\ndatasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves\nhighly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale\nstate-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show\nthat FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their\noriginal performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,\napplying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also\nimproves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our\napproach.

    "abstract": "This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can\nmatch human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision\nmaking contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target\nmatching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible\nanalogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect\nanalogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants\nexhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with\nstronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying\nmatching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that\nrequires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs\nare proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative\nadvantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error\nanalysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas\nhuman errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together,\nthe results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted\norganizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy\ngenerators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most\ncontextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.",

FreqKV\nintroduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications.

    "abstract": "Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of\ninvestigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial\ninsights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker\nidentification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing\nmodalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or\nspecific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a\ncommon approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality\ncombination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for\nclinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling\npre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained\nmodel seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting\nrich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This\nallows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural\nchanges, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of\nmodalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy\noutperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate\npre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training\nfrom scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and\nefficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.\nCode and trained models are available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/bmmae",

    "abstract": "Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge\nacross real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual\nreliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,\nLLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.\nUnderstanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains\nan open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to\nsystematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing\nPrompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,\nperiodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a\nHallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,\nconfidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple\nLLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more\nhallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied\nacross models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from\ngeneral-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for\nstudying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,\nmore introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of\nconceptual instability.",

    "abstract": "Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in\nbio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical\nstatistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While\nNeural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex\nbiological data, their traditional \"black-box\" nature presents challenges for\nvalidation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in\nMechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations\nlearned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI\ntechniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.\n  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the\ninternal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance\nfunctions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)\ndiscover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the\nnetwork to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how\nconfounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for\ncomparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,\nmachine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their\nrespective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution\nshifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a\nsolution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world\nscenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),\nwhich adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA\nmethods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise\nalignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source\ncorrelations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,\nresulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.\n  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate\nthe feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that\ncorrelation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can\nenhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we\npropose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.\nLinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and\ncorrelation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves\nas a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive\nexperiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods\nsignificantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and\nbackbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on\nOfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6%\ncomputation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.",

    "abstract": "Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating\nautonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,\nexisting approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient\nconsideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion\nmodel (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial\nsafety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a\ngraph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that\ncaptures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational\nefficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the\ndenoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and\nadversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that\ndrive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally\nrealistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module\nbased on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical\nplausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes\ndataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness\nand generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a\nhigh level of realism.

JointDiT demonstrates outstanding\njoint generation performance.

Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set\ndynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and\nfeasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior,\ngenerating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in\ncoverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation\nimproves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.",

It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate\nexecutable actions (\\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.\nTraining a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which\nthe GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the\ntask, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on\nhistorical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of\ninsufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of\nbacktracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above\nchallenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding\nand backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI\nsamples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and\nunified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.\nMoreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action\nfrom the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that\nled to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence\nbetween GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules\nof the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.",

Listeners evaluated\nanonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and\nPalate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.\nSpeech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error\nrates in the range of 30-40%).

This becomes even more critical\nduring anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'\ndelivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.\nExisting studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many\nworks focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly\nmodel abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other\nfeatures, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous\nevents occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in\nthese scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal\nattention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we\ndesign an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent\nneural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec\nto model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks\nand long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of\ncouriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal\ncircumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a\nmemory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention\nmechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the\nCOVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by\n12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over\nmultiple competitive baselines.",

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics\nindustry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service\nguarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where\ncouriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup\nsimultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and\ndelivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the\npickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the\ndelivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three\nmain challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately\ninterconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups\nhave stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it\nchallenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'\nspatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,\nbut have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,\na Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first\nemploy the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal\ndependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.\nThen we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the\nimbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as\nan auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior\ncourier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on\nreal industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A\nsystem based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more\nthan 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in\nBeijing.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,\nwherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data\ngenerated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by\ncontinuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device\nmodels. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling\nmachine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is\nunsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this\ncontext, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,\npreserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative\nupdates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor\nautonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial\ntasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL\nemploys an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and\ntask-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining\nlightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.\nMoreover, $\\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an\nautonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new\ntask has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately\nallows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without\nadditional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and\nTHUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\\rm{SacFL}$ in both\nclass-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios.

    "abstract": "Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent\nyears, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and\naccurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation\nand user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to\nrespect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still\nviolate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,\nand gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading\ncontent. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,\npixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus\noverlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that\nsystematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both\nopen-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian\nmechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark\nemploys a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted\nstudies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score\nbelow 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation\nrevealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics\nviolations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models\noften generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.\nThe results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer\nconcrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video\ngeneration.",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications\nacross diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up\ntraining. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art\napproach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a\nfaster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid\nusage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant\nuse of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter\nefficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a\nparametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video\nrepresentation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework\nthat can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the\nspatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,\nNVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter\nefficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels\nat once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video\nquality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed\nincrease of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019\nimprovements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)\nand an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),\ncompared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,\nwe demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,\nHEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform\nextensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm\nacross diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and\nvideo inpainting.

Mining this\nknowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted\nplayer behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards\nplayers' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on\ndiscovery of the \"game behaviours\" as micro-patterns formed by continuous\nsequence of games and the persistent \"play styles\" of the players' as a\nsequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We\npropose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses\non mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while\nthe second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a\nsupervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual\nobjective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired\ndecision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and\none-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player\npsychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic\nexplanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of\nthe two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel\nformulation of \"bridge loss\".

Leveraging\nBayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,\nthe method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth\ncontours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A\ncalibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical\naccuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual\nlabels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate\ncancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,\ntransfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were\navailable. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all\nscenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34\nsubjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated\nthreshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted\nin over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting\ncases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring\nefficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed\nclinical decisions.

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity and scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) have made\nsecurity a critical concern. This paper presents a novel Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based framework for comprehensive threat detection and prevention in IoT\nenvironments. The system integrates lightweight LLMs fine-tuned on IoT-specific\ndatasets (IoT-23, TON_IoT) for real-time anomaly detection and automated,\ncontext-aware mitigation strategies optimized for resource-constrained devices.\nA modular Docker-based deployment enables scalable and reproducible evaluation\nacross diverse network conditions. Experimental results in simulated IoT\nenvironments demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy,\nresponse latency, and resource efficiency over traditional security methods.\nThe proposed framework highlights the potential of LLM-driven, autonomous\nsecurity solutions for future IoT ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models\nhave revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and\nspeech recognition. While server-based deployments remain the locus of peak\nperformance, the imperative for on-device inference, necessitated by privacy\nand efficiency considerations, persists. Recognizing GPUs as the on-device ML\naccelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework\nthat extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference\nengines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which\ncontain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI\nmodels. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with\ncross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and\ndesktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly\nmore complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI\ninference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement\nrelative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.",

    "abstract": "As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver\nprecise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has\nbecome increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for\nenabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed\ndecision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.\nNonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual\nassessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the\nlevel of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model\nthat leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of\nthese events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's\nperformance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three\nmajor utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a\n2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer\nSatisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared\nto existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression\nmetrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the\noutcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ\ninterpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of\nincorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the\ncontributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive\napproach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,\nfostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.",

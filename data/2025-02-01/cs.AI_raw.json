    "abstract": "We present RPGBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language\nmodels (LLMs) as text-based role-playing game (RPG) engines. RPGBench comprises\ntwo core tasks: Game Creation (GC) and Game Simulation (GS). In GC, an LLM must\ncraft a valid and playable RPG world using a structured event-state\nrepresentation, ensuring logical coherence and proper termination conditions.\nIn GS, the LLM simulates interactive gameplay across multiple rounds while\nconsistently updating states and enforcing game rules. To comprehensively\nassess performance, RPGBench integrates objective and subjective evaluation\nmethodologies. Objective measures verify adherence to event mechanics and check\nvariable updates without requiring human intervention. Subjective measures,\nsuch as content interestingness, action quality, and role-playing capability,\nare evaluated via an LLM-as-a-judge framework, where a strong LLM grades each\ncandidate's outputs. Empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs\ncan produce engaging stories but often struggle to implement consistent,\nverifiable game mechanics, particularly in long or complex scenarios. By\ncombining structured, rule-based assessments with LLM-based judgments, RPGBench\nprovides a new standard for evaluating how well LLMs can balance creativity,\ncoherence, and complexity in text-based RPGs, opening avenues for more\nimmersive and controllable interactive storytelling.",

In\nthis work, we propose Fast Vision Mamba (FastVim), that further reduces the\ncomputational time of the SSM block by reducing the number of recurrent steps\nin Vision Mamba models while still retaining model performance. By alternately\npooling tokens along image dimensions across Mamba blocks, we obtain a\n2$\\times$ reduction in the number of parallel steps in SSM block.

    "abstract": "As digital technologies advance, communication networks face challenges in\nhandling the vast data generated by intelligent devices. Autonomous vehicles,\nsmart sensors, and IoT systems necessitate new paradigms. This thesis addresses\nthese challenges by integrating semantic communication and generative models\nfor optimized image compression and edge network resource allocation. Unlike\nbit-centric systems, semantic communication prioritizes transmitting meaningful\ndata specifically selected to convey the meaning rather than obtain a faithful\nrepresentation of the original data. The communication infrastructure can\nbenefit to significant improvements in bandwidth efficiency and latency\nreduction. Central to this work is the design of semantic-preserving image\ncompression using Generative Adversarial Networks and Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models. These models compress images by encoding only\nsemantically relevant features, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with\nminimal transmission. Additionally, a Goal-Oriented edge network optimization\nframework is introduced, leveraging the Information Bottleneck principle and\nstochastic optimization to dynamically allocate resources and enhance\nefficiency. By integrating semantic communication into edge networks, this\napproach balances computational efficiency and communication effectiveness,\nmaking it suitable for real-time applications. The thesis compares\nsemantic-aware models with conventional image compression techniques using\nclassical and semantic evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate the potential of\ncombining generative AI and semantic communication to create more efficient\nsemantic-goal-oriented communication networks that meet the demands of modern\ndata-driven applications.",

To address this issue, we\nintroduce pause-tuning, a technique that redistributes attention to enhance\ncomprehension of long-context inputs. Our approach involves fine-tuning\nlanguage models on datasets with artificially inserted pause tokens, which\nserve to segment the input into smaller, more manageable parts.

Our scaling analysis reveals that DR-MCTS exhibits better\nsample efficiency, notably outperforming standard MCTS with larger language\nmodels while using a smaller model. These results underscore DR-MCTS's\npotential for efficient decision-making in complex, real-world scenarios where\nsample efficiency is paramount.",

The graph representation of such networks is thereby influenced\nby the embedded spatial features of both nodes and edges. Accurate network\nrepresentation of the graph structure and graph features is a fundamental task\nfor various graph-related tasks. In this study, a Generic Multimodal Spatially\nGraph Convolutional Network (GMu-SGCN) is developed for efficient\nrepresentation of spatially embedded networks. The developed GMu-SGCN model has\nthe ability to learn the node connection pattern via multimodal node and edge\nfeatures. In order to evaluate the developed model, a river network dataset and\na power network dataset have been used as test beds. The river network\nrepresents the naturally developed SENs, whereas the power network represents a\nman-made network. Both types of networks are heavily constrained by the spatial\nenvironments and uncertainties from nature. Comprehensive evaluation analysis\nshows the developed GMu-SGCN can improve accuracy of the edge existence\nprediction task by 37.1\\% compared to a GraphSAGE model which only considers\nthe node's position feature in a power network test bed.

In this paper, we present the first theoretical error\ndecomposition analysis of these techniques, breaking down their error into\nestimation error and model error. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off:\nperplexity methods suffer from substantial model error due to the absence of a\nproper consistency function, while self-consistency exhibits high estimation\nerror due to a slow error convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Reasoning-Pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC). This approach combines\nPerplexity Consistency, which seamlessly integrates LLM perplexity with\nself-consistency, and Reasoning Pruning, which eliminates low-probability\nreasoning paths to effectively prevent the degeneration of estimation error\nreduction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RPC not only accelerates the\nconvergence rate of estimation error to an exponential level but also holds\nstrong potential for further reducing model error. Extensive empirical\nevaluations on seven benchmark datasets confirm that RPC can significantly\nimprove reasoning performance, sample efficiency, and confidence reliability.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection is an important but challenging task in causal inference\nfor obtaining unbiased estimates of causal quantities. Properly selected\nfeatures in causal inference not only significantly reduce the time required to\nimplement a matching algorithm but, more importantly, can also reduce the bias\nand variance when estimating causal quantities. When feature selection\ntechniques are applied in causal inference, the crucial criterion is to select\nvariables that, when used for matching, can achieve an unbiased and robust\nestimation of causal quantities. Recent research suggests that balancing only\non treatment-associated variables introduces bias while balancing on spurious\nvariables increases variance. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced\nthree-stage framework that shows a significant improvement in selecting the\ndesired subset of variables compared to the existing state-of-the-art feature\nselection framework for causal inference, resulting in lower bias and variance\nin estimating the causal quantity. We evaluated our proposed framework using a\nstate-of-the-art synthetic data across various settings and observed superior\nperformance within a feasible computation time, ensuring scalability for\nlarge-scale datasets.

However, its learning\nefficiency is still insufficient, since the linear projections cannot be\ntransmitted to the child nodes, resulting in a waste of model parameters. In\nthis work, we propose an enhanced ODT method with Feature Concatenation\n(\\texttt{FC-ODT}), which enables in-model feature transformation to transmit\nthe projections along the decision paths.

Traditional diagnostic and treatment approaches,\nsuch as self-reported questionnaires and psychotherapy sessions, often impose\nsignificant burdens on both patients and clinicians, limiting accessibility and\nefficiency. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in\nNatural Language Processing and multimodal techniques, hold great potential for\nrecognizing and addressing conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. However, privacy\nconcerns, including the risk of sensitive data leakage from datasets and\ntrained models, remain a critical barrier to deploying these AI systems in\nreal-world clinical settings. These challenges are amplified in multimodal\nmethods, where personal identifiers such as voice and facial data can be\nmisused. This paper presents a critical and comprehensive study of the privacy\nchallenges associated with developing and deploying AI models for mental\nhealth. We further prescribe potential solutions, including data anonymization,\nsynthetic data generation, and privacy-preserving model training, to strengthen\nprivacy safeguards in practical applications. Additionally, we discuss\nevaluation frameworks to assess the privacy-utility trade-offs in these\napproaches.

However, their large\nparameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their\npractical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to\nreduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains\nunderexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization\n(PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs\nbecause of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b)\ndistributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme\noutliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues,\nMQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning\ndistinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant\nFlexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while\neliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude\nSuppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard\nrotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2),\nMQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (<1% degradation) while\nreducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing\nPTQ baselines. Our MQuant effectively bridges the gap for efficient and\naccurate MLLMs inference in resource-constrained devices. Code will be\nreleased.",

Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian\nmanifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive\ncurvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph\nstructures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile,\nspectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making\nit effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can\nsignificantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose\nSpectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph\nrepresentation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and\nSPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral\nfilters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds\n(hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three\nnovel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph\nLaplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature\nsignals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph\nfilters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp\nPooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based\npositional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved\nsubstructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and\nheterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node\nclassification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over\nstate-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO),\nhave shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data,\noffering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web\nfor embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where\nchanges between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions.\nUnfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may\nhinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we\nempirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and\ndemonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO\nmodification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by\nlinear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with\nground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action\nlearning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings\nsuggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training\nis critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional\npipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to\nground-truth actions.",

    "abstract": "Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS)\nrequires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to\ndetermine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging\ntransformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have\nachieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important\nquestion remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to\nsegment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this\nissue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in\ncurrent methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly\non visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in\nunreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark\nincorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient\nnoise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach\ncombining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided\nsimilarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS\nmethods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the\nprevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable\nimprovements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining\nnear-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation\nperformance.",

Due to significant\nstatistical heterogeneity, traditional FL struggles to generalize a shared\nmodel across diverse data domains. Personalized federated learning addresses\nthis issue by dividing the model into a globally shared part and a locally\nprivate part, with the local model correcting representation biases introduced\nby the global model. Nevertheless, locally converged parameters more accurately\ncapture domain-specific knowledge, and current methods overlook the potential\nbenefits of these parameters.

We applied the\nPM-MoE architecture to nine recent model-split-based personalized federated\nlearning algorithms, achieving performance improvements with minimal additional\ntraining.

To propel this vision forward, we unveil a new data\nrecipe for post-training LLMs, enhancing their comprehension of data management\nand empowering them to tackle complex real-world analytics tasks. Specifically,\nour innovative approach includes a scalable synthetic data generation method\nthat enables the creation of a broad spectrum of topics centered on data\nrepresentation and manipulation. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks that\nseamlessly bridge tables and text. We show that such tasks can enhance models'\nunderstanding of schema creation and the nuanced translation between natural\nlanguage and tabular data. Leveraging this data recipe, we post-train a new\nfoundation model, named CoddLLM, based on Mistral-NeMo-12B.

This limitation becomes\nparticularly evident in cold-start and long-tail scenarios, where traditional\napproaches struggle to deliver effective results. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel Multi-modal Content Interest Modeling paradigm (MIM), which\nconsists of three key stages: Pre-training, Content-Interest-Aware Supervised\nFine-Tuning (C-SFT), and Content-Interest-Aware UBM (CiUBM). The pre-training\nstage adapts foundational models to domain-specific data, enabling the\nextraction of high-quality multi-modal embeddings. The C-SFT stage bridges the\nsemantic gap between content and user interests by leveraging user behavior\nsignals to guide the alignment of embeddings with user preferences. Finally,\nthe CiUBM stage integrates multi-modal embeddings and ID-based collaborative\nfiltering signals into a unified framework.

Despite advancements, challenges persist\ndue to system complexity, feature distinctiveness issues, and noise\ninterference. This paper introduces a new end-to-end (E2E) deep learning\nmulti-resolution framework for SER, addressing these limitations by extracting\nmeaningful representations directly from raw waveform speech signals. By\nleveraging the properties of the fast discrete wavelet transform (FDWT),\nincluding the cascade algorithm, conjugate quadrature filter, and coefficient\ndenoising, our approach introduces a learnable model for both wavelet bases and\ndenoising through deep learning techniques. The framework incorporates an\nactivation function for learnable asymmetric hard thresholding of wavelet\ncoefficients. Our approach exploits the capabilities of wavelets for effective\nlocalization in both time and frequency domains. We then combine\none-dimensional dilated convolutional neural networks (1D dilated CNN) with a\nspatial attention layer and bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) with a\ntemporal attention layer to efficiently capture the nuanced spatial and\ntemporal characteristics of emotional features. By handling variable-length\nspeech without segmentation and eliminating the need for pre or\npost-processing, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on\nIEMOCAP and EMO-DB datasets.

    "abstract": "At the core of the popular Transformer architecture is the self-attention\nmechanism, which dynamically assigns softmax weights to each input token so\nthat the model can focus on the most salient information. However, the softmax\nstructure slows down the attention computation due to its row-wise nature, and\ninherently introduces competition among tokens: as the weight assigned to one\ntoken increases, the weights of others decrease. This competitive dynamic may\nnarrow the focus of self-attention to a limited set of features, potentially\noverlooking other informative characteristics. Recent experimental studies have\nshown that using the element-wise sigmoid function helps eliminate token\ncompetition and reduce the computational overhead. Despite these promising\nempirical results, a rigorous comparison between sigmoid and softmax\nself-attention mechanisms remains absent in the literature. This paper closes\nthis gap by theoretically demonstrating that sigmoid self-attention is more\nsample-efficient than its softmax counterpart. Toward that goal, we illustrate\nthat each row of the self-attention matrix can be represented as a mixture of\nexperts. Our analysis shows that ''experts'' in sigmoid self-attention require\nsignificantly less data to achieve the same approximation error as those in\nsoftmax self-attention.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in handling\nunpredictable edge-case scenarios, such as adversarial pedestrian movements,\ndangerous vehicle maneuvers, and sudden environmental changes. Current\nend-to-end driving models struggle with generalization to these rare events due\nto limitations in traditional detection and prediction approaches. To address\nthis, we propose INSIGHT (Integration of Semantic and Visual Inputs for\nGeneralized Hazard Tracking), a hierarchical vision-language model (VLM)\nframework designed to enhance hazard detection and edge-case evaluation. By\nusing multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual\nrepresentations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and\naccurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of\nVLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms\nand coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K\ndataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction\nstraightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable\nincrease in generalization performance. This advancement enhances the\nrobustness and safety of autonomous driving systems, ensuring improved\nsituational awareness and potential decision-making in complex real-world\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating multiple modalities into large language models (LLMs) is a\npowerful way to enhance their understanding of non-textual data, enabling them\nto perform multimodal tasks. Vision language models (VLMs) form the fastest\ngrowing category of multimodal models because of their many practical use\ncases, including in healthcare, robotics, and accessibility. Unfortunately,\neven though different VLMs in the literature demonstrate impressive visual\ncapabilities in different benchmarks, they are handcrafted by human experts;\nthere is no automated framework to create task-specific multimodal models.\n  We introduce Mordal, an automated multimodal model search framework that\nefficiently finds the best VLM for a user-defined task without manual\nintervention. Mordal achieves this both by reducing the number of candidates to\nconsider during the search process and by minimizing the time required to\nevaluate each remaining candidate. Our evaluation shows that Mordal can find\nthe best VLM for a given problem using up to $8.9\\times$--$11.6\\times$ lower\nGPU hours than grid search. In the process of our evaluation, we have also\ndiscovered new VLMs that outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts.",

    "abstract": "A novel hybrid Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework\nis presented for oil-water classification in hyperspectral images (HSI). To\naddress the challenge of preserving spatial context, the images were divided\ninto smaller, non-overlapping tiles, which served as the basis for training,\nvalidation, and testing. Random Forest demonstrated strong performance in\npixel-wise classification, outperforming models such as XGBoost,\nAttention-Based U-Net, and HybridSN. However, Random Forest loses spatial\ncontext, limiting its ability to fully exploit the spatial relationships in\nhyperspectral data. To improve performance, a CNN was trained on the\nprobability maps generated by the Random Forest, leveraging the CNN's capacity\nto incorporate spatial context. The hybrid approach achieved 7.6% improvement\nin recall (to 0.85), 2.4% improvement in F1 score (to 0.84), and 0.54%\nimprovement in AUC (to 0.99) compared to the baseline. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of combining probabilistic outputs with spatial feature\nlearning for context-aware analysis of hyperspectral images.",

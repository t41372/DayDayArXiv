Recent studies explore GAI adoption\nexperiences of creative practitioners, but we know little about how these\nexperiences evolve into established practices and how GAI resistance alters\nthese practices. To address this gap, we conducted 25 semi-structured\ninterviews with writing professionals who adopted and/or resisted GAI. Using\nthe theoretical lens of Job Crafting, we identify four strategies professionals\nemploy to reshape their roles. Writing professionals employed GAI resisting\nstrategies to maximize human potential, reinforce professional identity, carve\nout a professional niche, and preserve credibility within their networks. In\ncontrast, GAI-enabled strategies allowed writers who embraced GAI to enhance\ndesirable workflows, minimize mundane tasks, and engage in new AI-managerial\nlabor. These strategies amplified their collaborations with GAI while reducing\ntheir reliance on other people. We conclude by discussing implications of GAI\npractices on writers' identity and practices as well as crafting theory.",

    "abstract": "Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in\n2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support\nmany downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal\nknowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization\ncapabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly\ncomplex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features\nuseful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose\nCleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework\nintroducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive\napproaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct\nfeature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP)\nprojection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies\nthroughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on\npseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without\nexplicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary\nself-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic\nknowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for\n2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up\nto 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing\nthe effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy",

Unlike traditional methods that rely on expert\ndemonstrations or human-annotated datasets, Vi-LAD performs knowledge\ndistillation and fine-tuning at the intermediate layer representation level\n(i.e., attention maps) by leveraging the backbone of a pre-trained\nvision-action model.

Vi-LAD fine-tunes a transformer-based model using intermediate\nattention maps extracted from the pre-trained vision-action model, combined\nwith attention-like semantic maps constructed from a large VLM. To achieve\nthis, we introduce a novel attention-level distillation loss that fuses\nknowledge from both sources, generating augmented attention maps with enhanced\nsocial awareness.

In this paper, we present a novel\nmethod that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages\noptical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing\nbiologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as\nvessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then\nperforms DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and\nedges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We\ncollect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to\nphysiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into\ntextual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual\ndescriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final\nagent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human\ninterpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental\nevaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method\nnot only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically\ninterpretable results.

For the purposes of this\nbenchmark, by \"data minimization\" we mean instances where private information\nis shared only when it is necessary to fulfill a specific task-relevant\npurpose. We develop a benchmark called AgentDAM to evaluate how well existing\nand future AI agents can limit processing of potentially private information\nthat we designate \"necessary\" to fulfill the task. Our benchmark simulates\nrealistic web interaction scenarios and is adaptable to all existing web\nnavigation agents. We use AgentDAM to evaluate how well AI agents built on top\nof GPT-4, Llama-3 and Claude can limit processing of potentially private\ninformation when unnecessary, and show that these agents are often prone to\ninadvertent use of unnecessary sensitive information. We finally propose a\nprompting-based approach that reduces this.",

    "abstract": "Data privacy remains a critical concern in educational research,\nnecessitating Institutional Review Board (IRB) certification and stringent data\nhandling protocols to ensure compliance with ethical standards. Traditional\napproaches rely on anonymization and controlled data-sharing mechanisms to\nfacilitate research while mitigating privacy risks. However, these methods\nstill involve direct access to raw student data, posing potential\nvulnerabilities and being time-consuming. This study proposes a federated\nlearning (FL) framework for automatic scoring in educational assessments,\neliminating the need to share raw data. Our approach leverages client-side\nmodel training, where student responses are processed locally on edge devices,\nand only optimized model parameters are shared with a central aggregation\nserver. To effectively aggregate heterogeneous model updates, we introduce an\nadaptive weighted averaging strategy, which dynamically adjusts weight\ncontributions based on client-specific learning characteristics. This method\nensures robust model convergence while preserving privacy. We evaluate our\nframework using assessment data from nine middle schools, comparing the\naccuracy of federated learning-based scoring models with traditionally trained\ncentralized models. A statistical significance test (paired t-test, $t(8) =\n2.29, p = 0.051$) confirms that the accuracy difference between the two\napproaches is not statistically significant, demonstrating that federated\nlearning achieves comparable performance while safeguarding student data.\nFurthermore, our method significantly reduces data collection, processing, and\ndeployment overhead, accelerating the adoption of AI-driven educational\nassessments in a privacy-compliant manner.",

Mobile diary entries-short text entries recording through their phone\nabout their emotional experiences-provide a promising method for tracking these\nexperiences in real time. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for\nrecognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual\nunderstanding necessary to accurately interpret the brief, personal narratives\nin mobile diaries. We propose CALLM, a context-aware emotion analysis framework\nthat leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG), to analyze mobile diary entries from cancer survivors to predict their\nemotional states. The framework enhances prediction accuracy beyond existing\nmethods by (1) integrating retrieved peer experiences as contextual examples\nand (2) incorporating individuals' temporal emotional trajectories from their\nmobile diary entries. We collected a large-scale dataset (N=407) of cancer\nsurvivors' mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), which assessed\npositive and negative affect, desire to regulate emotions, social interaction\nquality, and availability for interventions, alongside daily mobile diary\nentries in an open response format regarding what was driving their current\nemotional experience. Results demonstrate strong performance of CALLM, with\nbalanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive and 73.29% for negative\naffect, and 73.72% for predicting individual's desire to regulate emotions.\nPost-hoc analysis reveals that leveraging model confidence, encouraging longer\ndiary entries, and incorporating personal ground truth, further enhance\npredictive outcomes. Our findings support the feasibility of deploying\nLLM-powered emotion analysis in chronic health populations and suggest\npromising directions for personalized interventions for cancer survivors.",

We propose a recipe for building effective block\ndiffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of\ngradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance.\nBlock diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models\non language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length\nsequences.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as\nOpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in\ncomplex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success\nlies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics,\nwhich enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate\nproblems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long\nCoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from\ntraditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates\non issues like \"overthinking\" and \"test-time scaling.\" This survey seeks to\nfill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first\ndistinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to\ncategorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key\ncharacteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and\nfeasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and\nproduce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT.\n(3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with\nthese characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering\ninsights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we\nidentify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions,\nincluding the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements,\nand enhanced knowledge frameworks.

Specifically, we show that, when trained with\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) under the Maximal Update parametrization\n($\\mu$P) and mild conditions on the activation function, SGD enables these\nnetworks to learn linearly independent features that substantially deviate from\ntheir initial values. This rich feature space captures relevant data\ninformation and ensures that any convergent point of the training process is a\nglobal minimum. Our analysis leverages both the interactions among features\nacross layers and the properties of Gaussian random variables, providing new\ninsights into deep representation learning.

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for\nvarious applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF)\nsignals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the\nsignal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus\non single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot\ngeneralize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance.\nSpecifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are\nentangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also\nintertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific\nconfounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates\ncounterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE\ntrains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how\nhuman body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate\nskeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for\ngenerative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences\nbetween counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific\nconfounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent\nrepresentations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new\nsubjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three\npublic datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental\nresults show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces\nestimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for\ncross-environment HPE.",

We use a LLM's recollection of each key\nmoment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the\nagent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then\nmeasure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of\nhuman-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved\nvia amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired\nconstitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real\nworld. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out\nto be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions\ntypically made in SciFi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that\ngenerated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base\nmodel (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting\n(23.3% to 92.3%).

However, current single-agent work\nlacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low\nefficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking\nAgents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think\nabout thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical\nagents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic\noversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions.\nThrough iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents\nexplore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and\nrobustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent\nRL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level\nmathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in\nsynthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However,\nits rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates\nsignificantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the\nmodel's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2)\nchallenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution\nchanges and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view\ngeneration--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than\nthose in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach\nfor close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model\nwith self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we\nleverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to\nenhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to\nprogressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set\nof reference views for See3D.

Traditional recommender\nsystems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making\nit difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an\ninteractive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs)\nhas revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their\nevolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation\nassistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt\ntemplates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of\npersonalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their\ncapabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual\nuser queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them\nunsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To\naddress this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to\naccess LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era\nof LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard\nconditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated\ncommonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs\ndemonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs\nare better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing\nchallenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading\ninformation.

Currently, in the field of pig behavior\nrecognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits\nthe development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and\nalgorithm optimization.This paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig\nbehaviors that significantly impact welfare.Based on this dataset, this paper\nproposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the\nattention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and\ntheir associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a\nspatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement\nnetwork. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing\nconnections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the\nvideo data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens\nthe important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term\ndependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by\nremodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of\nspatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors.

In this context, medical image\nretrieval becomes a critical component of clinical data management, playing a\nvital role in decision-making and safeguarding patient information. Existing\nmethods usually learn hash functions using bottleneck features, which fail to\nproduce representative hash codes from blended embeddings. Although contrastive\nhashing has shown superior performance, current approaches often treat image\nretrieval as a classification task, using category labels to create\npositive/negative pairs. Moreover, many methods fail to address the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) issue when models encounter external OOD queries or\nadversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method to consolidate\nknowledge of hierarchical features and optimisation functions. We formulate the\nknowledge consolidation by introducing Depth-aware Representation Fusion (DaRF)\nand Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing (SCH). DaRF adaptively integrates\nshallow and deep representations into blended features, and SCH incorporates\nimage fingerprints to enhance the adaptability of positive/negative pairings.\nThese blended features further facilitate OOD detection and content-based\nrecommendation, contributing to a secure AI-driven healthcare environment.\nMoreover, we present a content-guided ranking to improve the robustness and\nreproducibility of retrieval results.

Membership Inference\nAttacks (MIA) exploit it to obtain confidential information about the data used\nfor training, aiming to steal information. They can be repurposed as a\nmeasurement of data integrity by inferring whether it was used to train a\nmachine learning model. While state-of-the-art attacks achieve a significant\nprivacy leakage, their requirements are not feasible enough, hindering their\nrole as practical tools to assess the magnitude of the privacy risk. Moreover,\nthe most appropriate evaluation metric of MIA, the True Positive Rate at low\nFalse Positive Rate lacks interpretability. We claim that the incorporation of\nFew-Shot Learning techniques to the MIA field and a proper qualitative and\nquantitative privacy evaluation measure should deal with these issues. In this\ncontext, our proposal is twofold.

Furthermore, we propose an interpretable quantitative\nand qualitative measure of privacy, referred to as Log-MIA measure. Jointly,\nthese proposals provide new tools to assess the privacy leakage and to ease the\nevaluation of the training data integrity of deep learning models, that is, to\nanalyze the privacy breach of a deep learning model.

To thoroughly\ninvestigate the human-LMM gap and its underlying causes, we propose MOAT, a\ndiverse benchmark with complex real-world VL tasks that are challenging for\nLMMs. Specifically, the tasks in MOAT require LMMs to engage in generalist\nproblem solving by integrating fundamental VL capabilities such as reading\ntext, counting, understanding spatial relations, grounding textual and visual\ninstructions, etc. All these abilities fit into a taxonomy proposed by us that\ncontains 10 fundamental VL capabilities, enabling MOAT to provide a\nfine-grained view of LMMs' strengths and weaknesses.

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning is an emerging paradigm to remove the influence of\nspecific training data (i.e., the forget set) from a model while preserving its\nknowledge of the rest of the data (i.e., the retain set). Previous approaches\nassume the forget data to be uniformly distributed from all training\ndatapoints. However, if the data to unlearn is dominant in one group, we\nempirically show that performance for this group degrades, leading to fairness\nissues. This work tackles the overlooked problem of non-uniformly distributed\nforget sets, which we call group-robust machine unlearning, by presenting a\nsimple, effective strategy that mitigates the performance loss in dominant\ngroups via sample distribution reweighting. Moreover, we present MIU (Mutual\nInformation-aware Machine Unlearning), the first approach for group robustness\nin approximate machine unlearning. MIU minimizes the mutual information between\nmodel features and group information, achieving unlearning while reducing\nperformance degradation in the dominant group of the forget set. Additionally,\nMIU exploits sample distribution reweighting and mutual information calibration\nwith the original model to preserve group robustness. We conduct experiments on\nthree datasets and show that MIU outperforms standard methods, achieving\nunlearning without compromising model robustness.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in\nlanguage tasks and beyond. However, due to their limited inherent causal\nreasoning ability, LLMs still face challenges in handling tasks that require\nrobust causal reasoning ability, such as health-care and economic analysis. As\na result, a growing body of research has focused on enhancing the causal\nreasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the booming research, there lacks a survey\nto well review the challenges, progress and future directions in this area. To\nbridge this significant gap, we systematically review literature on how to\nstrengthen LLMs' causal reasoning ability in this paper. We start from the\nintroduction of background and motivations of this topic, followed by the\nsummarisation of key challenges in this area. Thereafter, we propose a novel\ntaxonomy to systematically categorise existing methods, together with detailed\ncomparisons within and between classes of methods. Furthermore, we summarise\nexisting benchmarks and evaluation metrics for assessing LLMs' causal reasoning\nability.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic Recourse is a way for users to modify their attributes to align\nwith a model's expectations, thereby improving their outcomes after receiving\nunfavorable decisions. In real-world scenarios, users often need to\nstrategically adjust their attributes to compete for limited resources.\nHowever, such strategic behavior induces users to \"game\" algorithms, causing\nmodel collapse due to distribution shifts. These shifts arise from user\ncompetition, resource constraints, and adaptive user responses. While prior\nresearch on Algorithmic Recourse has explored its effects on both systems and\nusers, the impact of resource constraints and competition over time remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we develop a general framework to model user\nstrategic behaviors and their interactions with decision-making systems under\nresource constraints and competitive dynamics. Through theoretical analysis and\nempirical evaluation, we identify three key phenomena that arise consistently\nin both synthetic and real-world datasets: escalating decision boundaries,\nnon-robust model predictions, and inequitable recourse actions. Finally, we\ndiscuss the broader social implications of these findings and present two\nalgorithmic strategies aimed at mitigating these challenges.",

Due to digitalisation, they have\nbecome a viable alternative to traditional surveys in application areas such as\npolitical science. One limitation, however, is their dependency on data to\ntrain the model for question selection. Often, such training data (i.e., user\ninteractions) are unavailable a priori. To address this problem, we (i) test\nwhether Large Language Models (LLM) can accurately generate such interaction\ndata and (ii) explore if these synthetic data can be used to pre-train the\nstatistical model of an adaptive political survey. To evaluate this approach,\nwe utilise existing data from the Swiss Voting Advice Application (VAA)\nSmartvote in two ways: First, we compare the distribution of LLM-generated\nsynthetic data to the real distribution to assess its similarity. Second, we\ncompare the performance of an adaptive questionnaire that is randomly\ninitialised with one pre-trained on synthetic data to assess their suitability\nfor training. We benchmark these results against an \"oracle\" questionnaire with\nperfect prior knowledge. We find that an off-the-shelf LLM (GPT-4) accurately\ngenerates answers to the Smartvote questionnaire from the perspective of\ndifferent Swiss parties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that initialising the\nstatistical model with synthetic data can (i) significantly reduce the error in\npredicting user responses and (ii) increase the candidate recommendation\naccuracy of the VAA.

However, most existing works focus on a finite, small set of agents or\nassume complete knowledge of the game, limiting their applicability to\nreal-world scenarios involving large populations and model uncertainty. To\naddress this gap, we study the design of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games\n(MFGs) with density-independent transitions, where both the transition dynamics\nand intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This setting presents non-trivial\nchallenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents to explore for its\nmodel learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer them to converge\nto desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments. Assuming\nagents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic\nexploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret\nguarantees for the cumulative gaps between the agents' behaviors and the\ndesired ones. In terms of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total\nincentive payments incur only sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline\nsteering strategy that stabilizes the target policy as an equilibrium.

Traditional studies mainly focus\non BERT-based models to assess the semantic relevance between queries and\nproducts. However, the discriminative paradigm and limited knowledge capacity\nof these approaches restrict their ability to comprehend the relevance between\nqueries and products fully. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), recent research has begun to explore their application to industrial\nsearch systems, as LLMs provide extensive world knowledge and flexible\noptimization for reasoning processes. Nonetheless, directly leveraging LLMs for\nrelevance prediction tasks introduces new challenges, including a high demand\nfor data quality, the necessity for meticulous optimization of reasoning\nprocesses, and an optimistic bias that can result in over-recall. To overcome\nthe above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called the LLM-based\nRElevance Framework (LREF) aimed at enhancing e-commerce search relevance. The\nframework comprises three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Data\nSelection, Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning, and Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) for de-biasing. We evaluate the performance of the framework\nthrough a series of offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, as\nwell as online A/B testing. The results indicate significant improvements in\nboth offline and online metrics. Ultimately, the model was deployed in a\nwell-known e-commerce application, yielding substantial commercial benefits.",

The world model that can foresee the\noutcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous\ndriving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the\ntrajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This\nlimitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction\nbetween the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a\nchallenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to\ncontrol the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model\nnamed EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories\nin videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in\nthe BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its\ncorresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the\nSpatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents\nspatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected\ndiffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents\nfor video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In\naddition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate\nthe controllability of trajectories.

    "abstract": "This paper studies a challenging robust federated learning task with model\nheterogeneous and data corrupted clients, where the clients have different\nlocal model structures. Data corruption is unavoidable due to factors such as\nrandom noise, compression artifacts, or environmental conditions in real-world\ndeployment, drastically crippling the entire federated system. To address these\nissues, this paper introduces a novel Robust Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated\nLearning (RAHFL) framework.

Its basic idea is to utilize\ncomplex augmented samples obtained by the mixed-data augmentation strategy for\nsupervised contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to\nlearn robust and diverse feature representations. Furthermore, we design an\nAsymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning strategy to resist corrupt feedback\nfrom external clients. The strategy allows clients to perform selective one-way\nlearning during collaborative learning phase, enabling clients to refrain from\nincorporating lower-quality information from less robust or underperforming\ncollaborators.

However, current UAV-assisted FL methods primarily\nfocus on single tasks, overlooking the need for multi-task training. In\ndisaster relief scenarios, UAVs perform tasks such as crowd detection, road\nfeasibility analysis, and disaster assessment, which exhibit time-varying\ndemands and potential correlations. In order to meet the time-varying\nrequirements of tasks and complete multiple tasks efficiently under resource\nconstraints, in this paper, we propose a UAV swarm based multi-task FL\nframework, where ground emergency vehicles (EVs) collaborate with UAVs to\naccomplish multiple tasks efficiently under constrained energy and bandwidth\nresources. Through theoretical analysis, we identify key factors affecting task\nperformance and introduce a task attention mechanism to dynamically evaluate\ntask importance, thereby achieving efficient resource allocation. Additionally,\nwe propose a task affinity (TA) metric to capture the dynamic correlation among\ntasks, thereby promoting task knowledge sharing to accelerate training and\nimprove the generalization ability of the model in different scenarios. To\noptimize resource allocation, we formulate a two-layer optimization problem to\njointly optimize UAV transmission power, computation frequency, bandwidth\nallocation, and UAV-EV associations. For the inner problem, we derive\nclosed-form solutions for transmission power, computation frequency, and\nbandwidth allocation and apply a block coordinate descent method for\noptimization. For the outer problem, a two-stage algorithm is designed to\ndetermine optimal UAV-EV associations. Furthermore, theoretical analysis\nreveals a trade-off between UAV energy consumption and multi-task performance.",

While state-of-the-art LMs often boast hundreds of\nbillions of parameters and are primarily deployed in data centers, recent\ntrends show a growing focus on compact models-typically under 10 billion\nparameters-enabled by techniques such as quantization and other model\ncompression techniques. This shift paves the way for LMs on edge devices,\noffering potential benefits such as enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and\nimproved data sovereignty. However, the inherent complexity of even these\nsmaller models, combined with the limited computing resources of edge hardware,\nraises critical questions about the practical trade-offs in executing LM\ninference outside the cloud. To address these challenges, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation of generative LM inference on representative CPU-based\nand GPU-accelerated edge devices.

Additionally, we examine\nthroughput-energy trade-offs, cost considerations, and usability, alongside an\nassessment of qualitative model performance. While quantization helps mitigate\nmemory overhead, it does not fully eliminate resource bottlenecks, especially\nfor larger models. Our findings quantify the memory and energy constraints that\nmust be considered for practical real-world deployments, offering concrete\ninsights into the trade-offs between model size, inference performance, and\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a constraint-guided deep learning framework for\ndeveloping physically consistent health indicators in bearing prognostics and\nhealth management. Conventional data-driven methods often lack physical\nplausibility, while physics-based models are limited by incomplete system\nknowledge. To address this, we integrate domain knowledge into deep learning\nusing constraints to enforce monotonicity, bound output values between 1 and 0\n(representing healthy to failed states), and ensure consistency between signal\nenergy trends and health indicator estimates. This eliminates the need for\ncomplex loss term balancing. We implement constraint-guided gradient descent\nwithin an autoencoder architecture, creating a constrained autoencoder.\nHowever, the framework is adaptable to other architectures. Using\ntime-frequency representations of accelerometer signals from the Pronostia\ndataset, our constrained model generates smoother, more reliable degradation\nprofiles compared to conventional methods, aligning with expected physical\nbehavior. Performance is assessed using three metrics: trendability,\nrobustness, and consistency. Compared to a conventional baseline, the\nconstrained model improves all three. Another baseline, incorporating\nmonotonicity via a soft-ranking loss function, outperforms in trendability but\nfalls short in robustness and consistency. An ablation study confirms that the\nmonotonicity constraint enhances trendability, the boundary constraint ensures\nconsistency, and the energy-health consistency constraint improves robustness.\nThese findings highlight the effectiveness of constraint-guided deep learning\nin producing reliable, physically meaningful health indicators, offering a\npromising direction for future prognostic applications.",

Existing methods typically train from\nscratch, overlooking the potential of base models, and often resort to data\nstorage to prevent forgetting. Moreover, because RF-CCD encompasses both\ncontinual learning and novel class discovery, previous approaches have\nstruggled to effectively integrate advanced techniques from these fields,\nresulting in less convincing comparisons and failing to reveal the unique\nchallenges posed by RF-CCD. To address these challenges, we lead the way in\nintegrating advancements from both domains and conducting extensive experiments\nand analyses. Our findings demonstrate that this integration can achieve\nstate-of-the-art results, leading to the conclusion that in the presence of\npre-trained models, the representation does not improve and may even degrade\nwith the introduction of unlabeled data. To mitigate representation\ndegradation, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective baseline method.\nThis method first utilizes prior knowledge of known categories to estimate the\nnumber of novel classes. It then acquires representations using a model\nspecifically trained on the base classes, generates high-quality pseudo-labels\nthrough k-means clustering, and trains only the classifier layer. We validate\nour conclusions and methods by conducting extensive experiments across multiple\nbenchmarks, including the Stanford Cars, CUB, iNat, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.\nThe results clearly illustrate our findings, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour baseline, and pave the way for future advancements in RF-CCD.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as\njailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety\nmechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we\ninvestigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by\nextracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in\nneuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable\nstates that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using\ndimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and\njailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We\nthen derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations,\nshifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this\ncausal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in\na subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through\nthe model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized\nor cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted\nperturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our\napproach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from\ntraditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques\nthat neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.",

    "abstract": "In self-supervised representation learning, Siamese networks are a natural\narchitecture for learning transformation-invariance by bringing representations\nof positive pairs closer together. But it is prone to collapse into a\ndegenerate solution. To address the issue, in contrastive learning, a\ncontrastive loss is used to prevent collapse by moving representations of\nnegative pairs away from each other. But it is known that algorithms with\nnegative sampling are not robust to a reduction in the number of negative\nsamples. So, on the other hand, there are algorithms that do not use negative\npairs. Many positive-only algorithms adopt asymmetric network architecture\nconsisting of source and target encoders as a key factor in coping with\ncollapse. By exploiting the asymmetric architecture, we introduce a methodology\nto implicitly incorporate the idea of contrastive learning. As its\nimplementation, we present a novel method guided stop-gradient. We apply our\nmethod to benchmark algorithms SimSiam and BYOL and show that our method\nstabilizes training and boosts performance. We also show that the algorithms\nwith our method work well with small batch sizes and do not collapse even when\nthere is no predictor. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/bych-lee/gsg.",

While\nprior research has attempted to demystify these models through input\nattribution and neuron role analysis, there's been a notable gap in considering\nlayer-level information and the holistic path of information flow across\nlayers. In this paper, we investigate the significance of influential neuron\npaths within vision Transformers, which is a path of neurons from the model\ninput to output that impacts the model inference most significantly. We first\npropose a joint influence measure to assess the contribution of a set of\nneurons to the model outcome. And we further provide a layer-progressive neuron\nlocating approach that efficiently selects the most influential neuron at each\nlayer trying to discover the crucial neuron path from input to output within\nthe target model. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method\nfinding the most influential neuron path along which the information flows,\nover the existing baseline solutions. Additionally, the neuron paths have\nillustrated that vision Transformers exhibit some specific inner working\nmechanism for processing the visual information within the same image category.\nWe further analyze the key effects of these neurons on the image classification\ntask, showcasing that the found neuron paths have already preserved the model\ncapability on downstream tasks, which may also shed some lights on real-world\napplications like model pruning.

This comparative approach enables the model to better understand the\ndifferences between high-quality and low-quality code, focusing on aspects that\nimpact code quality.

We conceptualize\nthese challenges as the \"Trilemma of Cardinality Estimation\", where learned\ncardinality estimation methods struggle to balance generality, accuracy, and\nupdatability. To address these challenges, we introduce DistJoin, a join\ncardinality estimator based on efficient distribution prediction using\nmulti-autoregressive models. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a\nmethod for estimating both equi and non-equi join cardinality by leveraging the\nconditional probability distributions of individual tables in a decoupled\nmanner. (2) To meet the requirements of efficient training and inference for\nDistJoin, we develop Adaptive Neural Predicate Modulation (ANPM), a\nhigh-throughput conditional probability distribution estimation model. (3) We\nformally analyze the variance of existing similar methods and demonstrate that\nsuch approaches suffer from variance accumulation issues. To mitigate this\nproblem, DistJoin employs a selectivity-based approach rather than a\ncount-based approach to infer join cardinality, effectively reducing variance.\nIn summary, DistJoin not only represents the first data-driven method to\neffectively support both equi and non-equi joins but also demonstrates superior\naccuracy while enabling fast and flexible updates. We evaluate DistJoin on\nJOB-light and JOB-light-ranges, extending the evaluation to non-equi join\nconditions. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest\naccuracy, robustness to data updates, generality, and comparable update and\ninference speed relative to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are transforming modern transportation, but their\nreliability and safety are significantly challenged by harsh weather conditions\nsuch as heavy rain, fog, and snow. These environmental factors impair the\nperformance of cameras, LiDAR, and radar, leading to reduced situational\nawareness and increased accident risks. Conventional cloud-based AI systems\nintroduce communication delays, making them unsuitable for the rapid\ndecision-making required in real-time autonomous navigation. This paper\npresents a novel Edge AI-driven real-time decision-making framework designed to\nenhance AV responsiveness under adverse weather conditions. The proposed\napproach integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) for improved perception, alongside reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based strategies to optimize vehicle control in uncertain environments. By\nprocessing data at the network edge, this system significantly reduces decision\nlatency while improving AV adaptability. The framework is evaluated using\nsimulated driving scenarios in CARLA and real-world data from the Waymo Open\nDataset, covering diverse weather conditions. Experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed model achieves a 40% reduction in processing time and a 25%\nenhancement in perception accuracy compared to conventional cloud-based\nsystems. These findings highlight the potential of Edge AI in improving AV\nautonomy, safety, and efficiency, paving the way for more reliable self-driving\ntechnology in challenging real-world environments.",

    "title": "JBFuzz: Jailbreaking LLMs Efficiently and Effectively Using Fuzzing",
    "authors": [

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language\nunderstanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various\naspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes\nwith novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content,\nvia an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM\ndevelopers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to\njailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming\nto understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming\napproaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues,\nwe propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming\ntechnique for jailbreaking LLMs.\n  JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting\nbugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to\neffectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight\nmutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the\nfuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only\nrequires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental\nevaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that\nJBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical\nquestions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz\nis extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60\nseconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and\nserves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.",

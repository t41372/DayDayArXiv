    "abstract": "In the japanese anime industry, predicting whether an upcoming product will\nbe popular is crucial. This paper presents a dataset and methods on predicting\nanime popularity using a multimodal textimage dataset constructed exclusively\nfrom freely available internet sources. The dataset was built following\nrigorous standards based on real-life investment experiences. A deep neural\nnetwork architecture leveraging GPT-2 and ResNet-50 to embed the data was\nemployed to investigate the correlation between the multimodal text-image input\nand a popularity score, discovering relevant strengths and weaknesses in the\ndataset. To measure the accuracy of the model, mean squared error (MSE) was\nused, obtaining a best result of 0.011 when considering all inputs and the full\nversion of the deep neural network, compared to the benchmark MSE 0.412\nobtained with traditional TF-IDF and PILtotensor vectorizations. This is the\nfirst proposal to address such task with multimodal datasets, revealing the\nsubstantial benefit of incorporating image information, even when a relatively\nsmall model (ResNet-50) was used to embed them.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for their\nexceptional abilities in various natural language processing tasks, but they\nsuffer from hallucinations that will cause performance degradation. One\npromising solution to improve the LLMs' performance is to ask LLMs to revise\ntheir answer after generation, a technique known as self-correction. Among the\ntwo types of self-correction, intrinsic self-correction is considered a\npromising direction because it does not utilize external knowledge. However,\nrecent works doubt the validity of LLM's ability to conduct intrinsic\nself-correction. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on the intrinsic\nself-correction capabilities of LLMs through theoretical analyses and empirical\nexperiments. In addition, we identify two critical factors for successful\nself-correction: zero temperature and fair prompts. Leveraging these factors,\nwe demonstrate that intrinsic self-correction ability is exhibited across\nmultiple existing LLMs. Our findings offer insights into the fundamental\ntheories underlying the self-correction behavior of LLMs and remark on the\nimportance of unbiased prompts and zero temperature settings in harnessing\ntheir full potential.",

Learning\ngood spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream\napplications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting,\ntrajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has\nbecome the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI)\nresearch, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep\nlearning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and\nevaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and\nbenchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental\ndata types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key\ncomponents: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15\ncommonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility\nof the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7\ngeo-aware image classification and 10 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a\ncomprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware model's overall\nperformance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score\nmetric.

Given an observed signal which is a superposition of a\ncollection of unknown (hidden/latent) signals, BSS aims at recovering the\nseparate, underlying signals from only the observed mixed signal. As an\nunderdetermined problem, BSS is notoriously difficult to solve in general, and\nmodern deep learning has provided engineers with an effective set of tools to\nsolve this problem. For example, autoencoders learn a low-dimensional hidden\nencoding of the input data which can then be used to perform signal separation.\nIn real-time systems, a common bottleneck is the transmission of data\n(communications) to a central command in order to await decisions. Bandwidth\nlimits dictate the frequency and resolution of the data being transmitted. To\novercome this, compressed sensing (CS) technology allows for the direct\nacquisition of compressed data with a near optimal reconstruction guarantee.\nThis paper addresses the question: can compressive acquisition be combined with\ndeep learning for BSS to provide a complete acquire-separate-predict pipeline?\nIn other words, the aim is to perform BSS on a compressively acquired signal\ndirectly without ever having to decompress the signal. We consider image data\n(MNIST and E-MNIST) and show how our compressive autoencoder approach solves\nthe problem of compressive BSS. We also provide some theoretical insights into\nthe problem.",

C-MAPSS is a well-studied dataset with much existing work in\nthe literature that address RUL prediction with classical and deep learning\nmethods. In the absence of published empirical physical laws governing the\nC-MAPSS data, our approach first uses stochastic methods to estimate the\ngoverning physics models from the noisy time series data.

When scaling up the underlying graphs of GNNs to a\nlarger size, we are forced to either train on the complete graph and keep the\nfull graph adjacency and node embeddings in memory (which is often infeasible)\nor mini-batch sample the graph (which results in exponentially growing\ncomputational complexities with respect to the number of GNN layers). Various\nsampling-based and historical-embedding-based methods are proposed to avoid\nthis exponential growth of complexities. However, none of these solutions\neliminates the linear dependence on graph size. This paper proposes a\nsketch-based algorithm whose training time and memory grow sublinearly with\nrespect to graph size by training GNNs atop a few compact sketches of graph\nadjacency and node embeddings. Based on polynomial tensor-sketch (PTS) theory,\nour framework provides a novel protocol for sketching non-linear activations\nand graph convolution matrices in GNNs, as opposed to existing methods that\nsketch linear weights or gradients in neural networks.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a key method for\naligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, current\noffline alignment approaches like DPO, IPO, and SLiC rely heavily on fixed\npreference datasets, which can lead to sub-optimal performance. On the other\nhand, recent literature has focused on designing online RLHF methods but still\nlacks a unified conceptual formulation and suffers from distribution shift\nissues. To address this, we establish that online LLM alignment is underpinned\nby bilevel optimization. By reducing this formulation to an efficient\nsingle-level first-order method (using the reward-policy equivalence), our\napproach generates new samples and iteratively refines model alignment by\nexploring responses and regulating preference labels. In doing so, we permit\nalignment methods to operate in an online and self-improving manner, as well as\ngeneralize prior online RLHF methods as special cases. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art iterative RLHF methods, our approach significantly improves\nalignment performance on open-sourced datasets with minimal computational\noverhead.",

    "abstract": "Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand,\nopen-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect\nclosed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in\nsimulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands.\nFurther, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real\ndata. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the\nrapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this\npaper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms,\nwhere we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to\nenable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather\nsimulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling\nbird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon.\nOur simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do\nnot influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows\nopen-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop\nevaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new\ncompetition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting\nin several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe\nthat simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can\nmatch recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our\nmodular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation\nstrategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future\nchallenges.

However, this many-shot multimodal ICL\nsetting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's\ncontext length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the\nmultimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional\ntokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots\ninto fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform\nmultimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors\n(MTV) -- compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in\nthe model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence\nof such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot\nin-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments\nsuggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots\nand generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length\nfor inference.

    "abstract": "In traditional RAG framework, the basic retrieval units are normally short.\nThe common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia\nparagraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to\nfind the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to generate answers\nfrom the short retrieved units. The imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light'\nreader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. The loss of contextual\ninformation in the short, chunked units may increase the likelihood of\nintroducing hard negatives during the retrieval stage. Additionally, the reader\nmight not fully leverage the capabilities of recent advancements in LLMs. In\norder to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG,\nconsisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. In the two\nWikipedia-based datasets, NQ and HotpotQA, LongRAG processes the entire\nWikipedia corpus into 4K-token units by grouping related documents. By\nincreasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total number of units.\nThis greatly reduces the burden on the retriever, resulting in strong retrieval\nperformance with only a few (less than 8) top units. Without requiring any\ntraining, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ and 64.3% on HotpotQA, which\nare on par with the (fully-trained) SoTA model. Furthermore, we test on two\nnon-Wikipedia-based datasets, Qasper and MultiFieldQA-en. LongRAG processes\neach individual document as a single (long) unit rather than chunking them into\nsmaller units. By doing so, we achieve an F1 score of 25.9% on Qasper and 57.5%\non MultiFieldQA-en. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for\ncombining RAG with long-context LLMs.",

This study investigates whether music can be decoded from\nhuman brain activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI) during its perception.\nLeveraging recent advancements in extensive datasets and pre-trained\ncomputational models, we construct mappings between neural data and latent\nrepresentations of musical stimuli. Our approach integrates functional and\nanatomical alignment techniques to facilitate cross-subject decoding,\naddressing the challenges posed by the low temporal resolution and\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fMRI data. Starting from the GTZan fMRI dataset,\nwhere five participants listened to 540 musical stimuli from 10 different\ngenres while their brain activity was recorded, we used the CLAP (Contrastive\nLanguage-Audio Pretraining) model to extract latent representations of the\nmusical stimuli and developed voxel-wise encoding models to identify brain\nregions responsive to these stimuli. By applying a threshold to the association\nbetween predicted and actual brain activity, we identified specific regions of\ninterest (ROIs) which can be interpreted as key players in music processing.\nOur decoding pipeline, primarily retrieval-based, employs a linear map to\nproject brain activity to the corresponding CLAP features. This enables us to\npredict and retrieve the musical stimuli most similar to those that originated\nthe fMRI data. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art identification\naccuracy, with our methods significantly outperforming existing approaches.

    "abstract": "Countless domains rely on Machine Learning (ML) models, including\nsafety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving, which this paper focuses\non. While the black box nature of ML is simply a nuisance in some domains, in\nsafety-critical domains, this makes ML models difficult to trust. To fully\nutilize ML models in safety-critical domains, it would be beneficial to have a\nmethod to improve trust in model robustness and accuracy without human experts\nchecking each decision. This research proposes a method to increase trust in ML\nmodels used in safety-critical domains by ensuring the robustness and\ncompleteness of the model's training dataset. Because ML models embody what\nthey are trained with, ensuring the completeness of training datasets can help\nto increase the trust in the training of ML models. To this end, this paper\nproposes the use of a domain ontology and an image quality characteristic\nontology to validate the domain completeness and image quality robustness of a\ntraining dataset. This research also presents an experiment as a proof of\nconcept for this method, where ontologies are built for the emergency road\nvehicle domain.",

    "abstract": "NL2VIS (natural language to visualization) is a promising and recent research\narea that involves interpreting natural language queries and translating them\ninto visualizations that accurately represent the underlying data. As we\nnavigate the era of big data, NL2VIS holds considerable application potential\nsince it greatly facilitates data exploration by non-expert users. Following\nthe increasingly widespread usage of generative AI in NL2VIS applications, in\nthis paper we present V-RECS, the first LLM-based Visual Recommender augmented\nwith explanations(E), captioning(C), and suggestions(S) for further data\nexploration. V-RECS' visualization narratives facilitate both response\nverification and data exploration by non-expert users. Furthermore, our\nproposed solution mitigates computational, controllability, and cost issues\nassociated with using powerful LLMs by leveraging a methodology to effectively\nfine-tune small models. To generate insightful visualization narratives, we use\nChain-of-Thoughts (CoT), a prompt engineering technique to help LLM identify\nand generate the logical steps to produce a correct answer. Since CoT is\nreported to perform poorly with small LLMs, we adopted a strategy in which a\nlarge LLM (GPT-4), acting as a Teacher, generates CoT-based instructions to\nfine-tune a small model, Llama-2-7B, which plays the role of a Student.\nExtensive experiments-based on a framework for the quantitative evaluation of\nAI-based visualizations and on manual assessment by a group of\nparticipants-show that V-RECS achieves performance scores comparable to GPT-4,\nat a much lower cost. The efficacy of the V-RECS teacher-student paradigm is\nalso demonstrated by the fact that the un-tuned Llama fails to perform the task\nin the vast majority of test cases. We release V-RECS for the visualization\ncommunity to assist visualization designers throughout the entire visualization\ngeneration process.",

However, a number of different\nfaithfulness metrics exist, begging the question of what is faithfulness\nexactly and how to achieve it. We make three key contributions. We begin by\nshowing that \\textit{existing metrics are not interchangeable} -- \\ie\nexplanations attaining high faithfulness according to one metric may be\nunfaithful according to others -- and can systematically ignore important\nproperties of explanations. We proceed to show that, surprisingly,\n\\textit{optimizing for faithfulness is not always a sensible design goal}.\nSpecifically, we prove that for injective regular GNN architectures, perfectly\nfaithful explanations are completely uninformative.

    "abstract": "Generative methods have recently seen significant improvements by generating\nin a lower-dimensional latent representation of the data. However, many of the\ngenerative methods applied in the latent space remain complex and difficult to\ntrain. Further, it is not entirely clear why transitioning to a\nlower-dimensional latent space can improve generative quality. In this work, we\nintroduce a new and simple generative method grounded in topology theory --\nGenerative Topological Networks (GTNs) -- which also provides insights into why\nlower-dimensional latent-space representations might be better-suited for data\ngeneration. GTNs are simple to train -- they employ a standard supervised\nlearning approach and do not suffer from common generative pitfalls such as\nmode collapse, posterior collapse or the need to pose constraints on the neural\nnetwork architecture. We demonstrate the use of GTNs on several datasets,\nincluding MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10 and the Hands and Palm Images dataset by\ntraining GTNs on a lower-dimensional latent representation of the data. We show\nthat GTNs can improve upon VAEs and that they are quick to converge, generating\nrealistic samples in early epochs. Further, we use the topological\nconsiderations behind the development of GTNs to offer insights into why\ngenerative models may benefit from operating on a lower-dimensional latent\nspace, highlighting the important link between the intrinsic dimension of the\ndata and the dimension in which the data is generated. Particularly, we\ndemonstrate that generating in high dimensional ambient spaces may be a\ncontributing factor to out-of-distribution samples generated by diffusion\nmodels. We also highlight other topological properties that are important to\nconsider when using and designing generative models. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/alonalj/GTN",

Recent deep learning methods enable the\ngeneration of realistic, natural co-speech gestures synchronized with speech,\nbut such approaches require large amounts of training data. \"In-the-wild\"\ndatasets, which compile videos from sources such as YouTube through human pose\ndetection models, offer a solution by providing 2D skeleton sequences that are\npaired with speech. Concurrently, innovative lifting models have emerged,\ncapable of transforming these 2D pose sequences into their 3D counterparts,\nleading to large and diverse datasets of 3D gestures. However, the derived 3D\npose estimation is essentially a pseudo-ground truth, with the actual ground\ntruth being the 2D motion data. This distinction raises questions about the\nimpact of gesture representation dimensionality on the quality of generated\nmotions, a topic that, to our knowledge, remains largely unexplored. In this\nwork, we evaluate the impact of the dimensionality of the training data, 2D or\n3D joint coordinates, on the performance of a multimodal speech-to-gesture deep\ngenerative model. We use a lifting model to convert 2D-generated sequences of\nbody pose to 3D.

The integration of both modalities through\nmultimodal fusion is a promising approach for processing MTTS. However, the\nquestion of how to effectively fuse both modalities remains open. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of several deep multimodal fusion\napproaches for MTTS forecasting.

We\nevaluate these fusion approaches on three distinct datasets, one of which was\ngenerated using a novel framework. This framework allows for the control of key\ndata properties, such as the strength and direction of intermodal interactions,\nmodality imbalance, and the degree of randomness in each modality, providing a\nmore controlled environment for testing fusion approaches. Our findings show\nthat the performance of different fusion approaches can be substantially\ninfluenced by the direction and strength of intermodal interactions.

Clinical decision\nsupport systems have been proposed to implement guidelines and improve\nadherence. One approach is to permit the navigation inside the recommendations,\npresented as a decision tree, but the size of the tree often limits this\napproach and may cause erroneous navigation, especially when it does not fit in\na single screen. Methods: We proposed an innovative visual interface to allow\nclinicians easily navigating inside decision trees for the management of\nCOVID-19 patients. It associates a multi-path tree model with the use of the\nfisheye visual technique, allowing the visualization of large decision trees in\na single screen. To evaluate the impact of this tool on guideline adherence, we\nconducted a randomized controlled trial in a near-real simulation setting,\ncomparing the decisions taken by medical students using Orient-COVID with those\ntaken with paper guidelines or without guidance, when performing on six\nrealistic clinical cases. Results: The results show that paper guidelines had\nno impact (p=0.97), while Orient-COVID significantly improved the guideline\nadherence compared to both other groups (p<0.0003). A significant impact of\nOrient-COVID was identified on several key points during the management of\nCOVID-19: ordering troponin lab tests, prescribing anticoagulant and oxygen\ntherapy. A multifactor analysis showed no difference between male and female\nparticipants. Conclusions: The use of an interactive decision tree for the\nmanagement of COVID-19 significantly improved the clinician adherence to\nguidelines.

The\nvariation, quantity, and quality of negative samples compared to positive\nsamples play crucial roles in learning meaningful embeddings for node\nclassification downstream tasks. Less variation, excessive quantity, and\nlow-quality negative samples cause the model to be overfitted for particular\nnodes, resulting in less robust models. To solve the overfitting problem in the\nGCL paradigm, this study proposes a novel Cumulative Sample Selection (CSS)\nalgorithm by comprehensively considering negative samples' quality, variations,\nand quantity. Initially, three negative sample pools are constructed: easy,\nmedium, and hard negative samples, which contain 25%, 50%, and 25% of the total\navailable negative samples, respectively. Then, 10% negative samples are\nselected from each of these three negative sample pools for training the model.\nAfter that, a decision agent module evaluates model training results and\ndecides whether to explore more negative samples from three negative sample\npools by increasing the ratio or keep exploiting the current sampling ratio.\nThe proposed algorithm is integrated into a proposed graph contrastive learning\nframework named NegAmplify. NegAmplify is compared with the SOTA methods on\nnine graph node classification datasets, with seven achieving better node\nclassification accuracy with up to 2.86% improvement.",

It has applications to interpretability, neural architecture search,\nprivacy, and continual learning. Despite strong successes in supervised\ndomains, such methods have not yet been extended to reinforcement learning,\nwhere the lack of a fixed dataset renders most distillation methods unusable.\nFilling the gap, we formalize behaviour distillation, a setting that aims to\ndiscover and then condense the information required for training an expert\npolicy into a synthetic dataset of state-action pairs, without access to expert\ndata. We then introduce Hallucinating Datasets with Evolution Strategies\n(HaDES), a method for behaviour distillation that can discover datasets of just\nfour state-action pairs which, under supervised learning, train agents to\ncompetitive performance levels in continuous control tasks. We show that these\ndatasets generalize out of distribution to training policies with a wide range\nof architectures and hyperparameters. We also demonstrate application to a\ndownstream task, namely training multi-task agents in a zero-shot fashion.\nBeyond behaviour distillation, HaDES provides significant improvements in\nneuroevolution for RL over previous approaches and achieves SoTA results on one\nstandard supervised dataset distillation task. Finally, we show that\nvisualizing the synthetic datasets can provide human-interpretable task\ninsights.",

Despite its importance, the problem\nof how the reward system has evolved is underexplored. In this paper, we try to\nreplicate the evolution of biologically plausible reward functions and\ninvestigate how environmental conditions affect evolved rewards' shape. For\nthis purpose, we developed a population-based decentralized evolutionary\nsimulation framework, where agents maintain their energy level to live longer\nand produce more children. Each agent inherits its reward function from its\nparent subject to mutation and learns to get rewards via reinforcement learning\nthroughout its lifetime. Our results show that biologically reasonable positive\nrewards for food acquisition and negative rewards for motor action can evolve\nfrom randomly initialized ones. However, we also find that the rewards for\nmotor action diverge into two modes: largely positive and slightly negative.\nThe emergence of positive motor action rewards is surprising because it can\nmake agents too active and inefficient in foraging. In environments with poor\nand poisonous foods, the evolution of rewards for less important foods tends to\nbe unstable, while rewards for normal foods are still stable. These results\ndemonstrate the usefulness of our simulation environment and energy-dependent\nbirth and death model for further studies of the origin of reward systems.",

We focus on the effects of transitively matched records,\ni.e. the records connected by paths in the graph G = (V,E) whose nodes and\nedges represent the records and whether they are a match or not. We present a\nreal-world instance of this problem, where the challenge is to match records of\ncompanies and financial securities originating from different data providers.\nWe also introduce two new multi-source benchmark datasets that present similar\nmatching challenges as real-world records. A distinctive characteristic of\nthese records is that they are regularly updated following real-world events,\nbut updates are not applied uniformly across data sources. This phenomenon\nmakes the matching of certain groups of records only possible through the use\nof transitive information.\n  In our experiments, we illustrate how considering transitively matched\nrecords is challenging since a limited amount of false positive pairwise match\npredictions can throw off the group assignment of large quantities of records.\nThus, we propose GraLMatch, a method that can partially detect and remove false\npositive pairwise predictions through graph-based properties.

    "abstract": "Sortition, the random selection of political representatives, is increasingly\nbeing used around the world to choose participants of deliberative processes\nlike Citizens' Assemblies. Motivated by sortition's practical importance, there\nhas been a recent flurry of research on sortition algorithms, whose task it is\nto select a panel from among a pool of volunteers. This panel must satisfy\nquotas enforcing representation of key population subgroups. Past work has\ncontributed an algorithmic approach for fulfilling this task while ensuring\nthat volunteers' chances of selection are maximally equal, as measured by any\nconvex equality objective. The question, then, is: which equality objective is\nthe right one? Past work has mainly studied the objectives Minimax and Leximin,\nwhich respectively minimize the maximum and maximize the minimum chance of\nselection given to any volunteer. Recent work showed that both of these\nobjectives have key weaknesses: Minimax is highly robust to manipulation but is\narbitrarily unfair; oppositely, Leximin is highly fair but arbitrarily\nmanipulable.\n  In light of this gap, we propose a new equality objective, Goldilocks, that\naims to achieve these ideals simultaneously by ensuring that no volunteer\nreceives too little or too much chance of selection. We theoretically bound the\nextent to which Goldilocks achieves these ideals, finding that in an important\nsense, Goldilocks recovers among the best available solutions in a given\ninstance. We then extend our bounds to the case where the output of Goldilocks\nis transformed to achieve a third goal, Transparency. Our empirical analysis of\nGoldilocks in real data is even more promising: we find that this objective\nachieves nearly instance-optimal minimum and maximum selection probabilities\nsimultaneously in most real instances -- an outcome not even guaranteed to be\npossible for any algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The article presents some current observations (as of April 10, 2024) on the\nintegration of AI-generated images within processes of media convergence. It\ndraws on two different concepts of intermediality. Primary intermediality\nconcepts are motivated by the object when a new type of technology develops the\npotential to become socially relevant as a media form and thus a socially,\npolitically, or culturally important communicative factor. Due to their\nuncertain 'measurements' within the wider media ecology, however, the new,\nstill potential media form appears hybrid. The \"inter-\" or \"between-\" of this\ninitial intermediality moment thus refers to the questionable \"site\" and the\nquestionable description of the potential media form between already existing\ntechnologies and cultural forms and their conceptual measurements. For\nsecondary concepts of intermediality, in contrast, it can be assumed that the\nboundaries of media forms and their application have already been drawn and are\nreasonably undisputed. This then raises the question of intentional and staged\nreferences to AI imagery within other media forms and pictures. The article\ndiscusses indicators of both intermediality moments using current examples and\ncontroversies surrounding AI images. The thesis is that there can be no talk of\na seamless 'integration' of AI images into the wider media landscape at the\nmoment (within films, comic books, or video games, for example) - as one of\ncountless other image production techniques - and that the medial 'site' of AI\nimage circulation - at least where it is not a matter of deception, but rather\ntheir conscious use as AI images - especially in social media communication and\nin fan cultures, but with repercussions for the more general media ecology and\nimage interpretation, insofar as the suspicion that an image could be\nAI-generated is now increasingly present as a \"hermeneutics of suspicion\".",

    "abstract": "Automating dexterous, contact-rich manipulation tasks using rigid robots is a\nsignificant challenge in robotics. Rigid robots, defined by their actuation\nthrough position commands, face issues of excessive contact forces due to their\ninability to adapt to contact with the environment, potentially causing damage.\nWhile compliance control schemes have been introduced to mitigate these issues\nby controlling forces via external sensors, they are hampered by the need for\nfine-tuning task-specific controller parameters. Learning from Demonstrations\n(LfD) offers an intuitive alternative, allowing robots to learn manipulations\nthrough observed actions. In this work, we introduce a novel system to enhance\nthe teaching of dexterous, contact-rich manipulations to rigid robots. Our\nsystem is twofold: firstly, it incorporates a teleoperation interface utilizing\nVirtual Reality (VR) controllers, designed to provide an intuitive and\ncost-effective method for task demonstration with haptic feedback. Secondly, we\npresent Comp-ACT (Compliance Control via Action Chunking with Transformers), a\nmethod that leverages the demonstrations to learn variable compliance control\nfrom a few demonstrations. Our methods have been validated across various\ncomplex contact-rich manipulation tasks using single-arm and bimanual robot\nsetups in simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our system in teaching robots dexterous manipulations with\nenhanced adaptability and safety.

(1) To assess whether neural tissue structure and biomechanics\ncould predict functional loss in glaucoma; (2) To evaluate the importance of\nbiomechanics in making such predictions. Design, Setting and Participants. We\nrecruited 238 glaucoma subjects. For one eye of each subject, we imaged the\noptic nerve head (ONH) using spectral-domain OCT under the following\nconditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with acute IOP elevation.\nMain Outcomes: We utilized automatic segmentation of optic nerve head (ONH)\ntissues and digital volume correlation (DVC) analysis to compute intraocular\npressure (IOP)-induced neural tissue strains. A robust geometric deep learning\napproach, known as Point-Net, was employed to predict the full Humphrey 24-2\npattern standard deviation (PSD) maps from ONH structural and biomechanical\ninformation. For each point in each PSD map, we predicted whether it exhibited\nno defect or a PSD value of less than 5%. Predictive performance was evaluated\nusing 5-fold cross-validation and the F1-score. We compared the model's\nperformance with and without the inclusion of IOP-induced strains to assess the\nimpact of biomechanics on prediction accuracy. Results: Integrating\nbiomechanical (IOP-induced neural tissue strains) and structural (tissue\nmorphology and neural tissues thickness) information yielded a significantly\nbetter predictive model (F1-score: 0.76+-0.02) across validation subjects, as\nopposed to relying only on structural information, which resulted in a\nsignificantly lower F1-score of 0.71+-0.02 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study\nhas shown that the integration of biomechanical data can significantly improve\nthe accuracy of visual field loss predictions. This highlights the importance\nof the biomechanics-function relationship in glaucoma, and suggests that\nbiomechanics may serve as a crucial indicator for the development and\nprogression of glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "RAG systems face limitations when semantic relevance alone does not guarantee\nimproved generation quality. This issue becomes particularly evident due to the\nsensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to the ordering of few-shot\nprompts, which can affect model performance. To address this challenge,\naligning LLM outputs with human preferences using structured feedback, such as\noptions to copy, regenerate, or dislike, offers a promising method for\nimprovement. This feedback is applied to the entire list of inputs rather than\ngiving specific ratings for individual documents, making it a Listwide Labels\nLearning-to-Rank task.\n  To address this task, we propose Pistis-RAG, a new RAG framework designed\nwith a content-centric approach to better align LLMs with human preferences.\nPistis-RAG effectively utilizes human feedback, enhancing content ranking and\ngeneration quality. To validate our framework, we use public datasets to\nsimulate human feedback, allowing us to evaluate and refine our method\neffectively. Experimental results indicate that Pistis-RAG improves alignment\nwith human preferences relative to the baseline RAG system, showing a 6.06%\nincrease in MMLU (English) and a 7.08% increase in C-EVAL (Chinese) accuracy\nmetrics. These results highlight Pistis-RAG's effectiveness in overcoming the\nlimitations associated with traditional RAG approaches.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs),\nare increasingly being employed in high-stakes decisions that impact both\nindividuals and society at large, often without adequate safeguards to ensure\nsafety, quality, and equity. Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are\nbiased - shortcomings that may reflect LLMs' inherent limitations and thus may\nnot be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human\nfeedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is\ntherefore problematic. Here we present a hybrid collective intelligence system\nthat mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human\nexperience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to\nopen-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by\nphysicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133\nmedical cases. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs\noutperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single\nLLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties\nand professional experience, and can be attributed to humans' and LLMs'\ncomplementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors.

However, existing\nmultimodal methods for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily rely on\nimaging and sometimes genetic data, often neglecting the transcriptomic basis\nof brain. Furthermore, while striving to integrate complementary information\nbetween modalities, most studies overlook the informativeness disparities\nbetween modalities. Here, we propose TMM, a trusted multiview multimodal graph\nattention framework for AD diagnosis, using extensive brain-wide\ntranscriptomics and imaging data. First, we construct view-specific brain\nregional co-function networks (RRIs) from transcriptomics and multimodal\nradiomics data to incorporate interaction information from both biomolecular\nand imaging perspectives. Next, we apply graph attention (GAT) processing to\neach RRI network to produce graph embeddings and employ cross-modal attention\nto fuse transcriptomics-derived embedding with each imagingderived embedding.\nFinally, a novel true-false-harmonized class probability (TFCP) strategy is\ndesigned to assess and adaptively adjust the prediction confidence of each\nmodality for AD diagnosis. We evaluate TMM using the AHBA database with\nbrain-wide transcriptomics data and the ADNI database with three imaging\nmodalities (AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM-MRI).

In this work, we consider the\nrelationship between the definitions of the continuous-time and discrete-time\nreturns.

    "abstract": "Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and\nthroughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing\nmethods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same\nsparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However,\nthis uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent\nin LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically\ntailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers.\nMoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and\ntheir scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model,\nevaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention\ncompression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some\nattention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other\nheads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show\nthat MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same\naverage attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the\nuniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-{7B,13B}, and Llama3-{8B,70B} models.\nMoreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models,\nreducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$\nacross two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a\n$1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction, boosting decode throughput by\n$6.6-8.2\\times$ and $1.7-1.9\\times$ compared to FlashAttention2 and vLLM, with\nminimal impact on performance.

Most existing benchmarks for empathy evaluation of LLMs focus\nprimarily on universal human emotions, such as sadness and pain, often\noverlooking the context of individuals' group identities. To address this gap,\nwe introduce GIEBench, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 11 identity\ndimensions, covering 97 group identities with a total of 999 single-choice\nquestions related to specific group identities. GIEBench is designed to\nevaluate the empathy of LLMs when presented with specific group identities such\nas gender, age, occupation, and race, emphasizing their ability to respond from\nthe standpoint of the identified group. This supports the ongoing development\nof empathetic LLM applications tailored to users with different identities. Our\nevaluation of 23 LLMs revealed that while these LLMs understand different\nidentity standpoints, they fail to consistently exhibit equal empathy across\nthese identities without explicit instructions to adopt those perspectives.\nThis highlights the need for improved alignment of LLMs with diverse values to\nbetter accommodate the multifaceted nature of human identities.

Due to the excessively large search space\nof the subset selection problem, prior methods optimize the batch acquisition\non the latent space, which has discrepancies with the actual space, or optimize\nindividual acquisition scores without considering the dependencies among\ncandidates in a batch instead of directly optimizing the batch acquisition. To\nmanage the vast search space, a simple and effective approach is the greedy\nmethod, which decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems, yet it has\ndifficulty in parallelization since each subproblem depends on the outcome from\nthe previous ones. To this end, we introduce a novel greedy-style subset\nselection algorithm that optimizes batch acquisition directly on the\ncombinatorial space by sequential greedy sampling from the greedy policy,\nspecifically trained to address all greedy subproblems concurrently.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in\nplatforms like Open AI's ChatGPT, coupled with their cost-effectiveness and\nhigh-quality results, has led to their rapid adoption among university\nstudents. However, discerning genuine student input from LLM-generated output\nposes a challenge for lecturers. This dilemma jeopardizes the trust\nrelationship between lecturers and students, potentially impacting university\ndownstream activities, particularly collaborative research initiatives. Despite\nattempts to establish guidelines for student LLM use, a clear framework\nmutually beneficial for lecturers and students in higher education remains\nelusive. This study addresses the research question: How does the use of LLMs\nby students impact Informational and Procedural Justice, influencing Team Trust\nand Expected Team Performance? Methodically, we applied a quantitative\nconstruct-based survey, evaluated using techniques of Structural Equation\nModelling (PLS- SEM) to examine potential relationships among these constructs.\nOur findings based on 23 valid respondents from Ndejje University indicate that\nlecturers are less concerned about the fairness of LLM use per se but are more\nfocused on the transparency of student utilization, which significantly\ninfluences Team Trust positively. This research contributes to the global\ndiscourse on integrating and regulating LLMs and subsequent models in\neducation. We propose that guidelines should support LLM use while enforcing\ntransparency in Lecturer-Student- Collaboration to foster Team Trust and\nPerformance.

This\nis partly because AI models require training with large numbers of examples\nonly available for common diseases. In clinical reality, however, only few\ndiseases are common, whereas the majority of diseases are less frequent\n(long-tail distribution). Current AI models overlook or misclassify these\ndiseases. We propose a deep anomaly detection approach that only requires\ntraining data from common diseases to detect also all less frequent diseases.\nWe collected two large real-world datasets of gastrointestinal biopsies, which\nare prototypical of the problem. Herein, the ten most common findings account\nfor approximately 90% of cases, whereas the remaining 10% contained 56 disease\nentities, including many cancers. 17 million histological images from 5,423\ncases were used for training and evaluation. Without any specific training for\nthe diseases, our best-performing model reliably detected a broad spectrum of\ninfrequent (\"anomalous\") pathologies with 95.0% (stomach) and 91.0% (colon)\nAUROC and generalized across scanners and hospitals. By design, the proposed\nanomaly detection can be expected to detect any pathological alteration in the\ndiagnostic tail of gastrointestinal biopsies, including rare primary or\nmetastatic cancers. This study establishes the first effective clinical\napplication of AI-based anomaly detection in histopathology that can flag\nanomalous cases, facilitate case prioritization, reduce missed diagnoses and\nenhance the general safety of AI models, thereby driving AI adoption and\nautomation in routine diagnostics and beyond.",

These critical functions pose significant obstacles to\nefficient hardware implementation due to their complex mathematical operations\nand the inherent resource count and architectural limitations of FPGAs.\nPEANO-ViT offers a novel approach to streamlining the implementation of the\nlayer normalization layer by introducing a division-free technique that\nsimultaneously approximates the division and square root function.\nAdditionally, PEANO-ViT provides a multi-scale division strategy to eliminate\ndivision operations in the softmax layer, aided by a Pade-based approximation\nfor the exponential function. Finally, PEANO-ViT introduces a piece-wise linear\napproximation for the GELU function, carefully designed to bypass the\ncomputationally intensive operations associated with GELU. In our comprehensive\nevaluations, PEANO-ViT exhibits minimal accuracy degradation (<= 0.5% for\nDeiT-B) while significantly enhancing power efficiency, achieving improvements\nof 1.91x, 1.39x, 8.01x for layer normalization, softmax, and GELU,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a\nsmall set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block\nproperties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for\ndata assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while\nreducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new\nclass of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform\nprevious methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation\ntasks. Diffusion models are trained to \"denoise\", which enables them to\ngenerate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random\nnoise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in\nthis study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent\nvariable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder\nfor dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application\ninvolves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent\ndiffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent\nwith samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial\nand flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the\ndiffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability\ntests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method.\nThe latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation.\nTwo synthetic \"true\" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction,\nposterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and\nconsistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of the IoT, the security of connected\ndevices has become a paramount concern. This paper explores the concept of\nproactive threat hunting as a pivotal strategy for enhancing the security and\nsustainability of IoT systems. Proactive threat hunting is an alternative to\ntraditional reactive security measures that analyses IoT networks continuously\nand in advance to find and eliminate threats before they occure. By improving\nthe security posture of IoT devices this approach significantly contributes to\nextending IoT operational lifespan and reduces environmental impact. By\nintegrating security metrics similar to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System\n(CVSS) into consumer platforms, this paper argues that proactive threat hunting\ncan elevate user awareness about the security of IoT devices. This has the\npotential to impact consumer choices and encourage a security-conscious mindset\nin both the manufacturing and user communities. Through a comprehensive\nanalysis, this study demonstrates how proactive threat hunting can contribute\nto the development of a more secure, sustainable, and user-aware IoT ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven deep learning models are transforming global weather forecasting.\nIt is an open question if this success can extend to climate modeling, where\nthe complexity of the data and long inference rollouts pose significant\nchallenges. Here, we present the first conditional generative model that\nproduces accurate and physically consistent global climate ensemble simulations\nby emulating a coarse version of the United States' primary operational global\nforecast model, FV3GFS. Our model integrates the dynamics-informed diffusion\nframework (DYffusion) with the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO)\narchitecture, enabling stable 100-year simulations at 6-hourly timesteps while\nmaintaining low computational overhead compared to single-step deterministic\nbaselines. The model achieves near gold-standard performance for climate model\nemulation, outperforming existing approaches and demonstrating promising\nensemble skill. This work represents a significant advance towards efficient,\ndata-driven climate simulations that can enhance our understanding of the\nclimate system and inform adaptation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Single-camera-training person re-identification (SCT re-ID) aims to train a\nre-ID model using SCT datasets where each person appears in only one camera.\nThe main challenge of SCT re-ID is to learn camera-invariant feature\nrepresentations without cross-camera same-person (CCSP) data as supervision.\nPrevious methods address it by assuming that the most similar person should be\nfound in another camera. However, this assumption is not guaranteed to be\ncorrect. In this paper, we propose a Camera-Invariant Meta-Learning Network\n(CIMN) for SCT re-ID. CIMN assumes that the camera-invariant feature\nrepresentations should be robust to camera changes. To this end, we split the\ntraining data into meta-train set and meta-test set based on camera IDs and\nperform a cross-camera simulation via meta-learning strategy, aiming to enforce\nthe representations learned from the meta-train set to be robust to the\nmeta-test set. With the cross-camera simulation, CIMN can learn\ncamera-invariant and identity-discriminative representations even there are no\nCCSP data. However, this simulation also causes the separation of the\nmeta-train set and the meta-test set, which ignores some beneficial relations\nbetween them. Thus, we introduce three losses: meta triplet loss, meta\nclassification loss, and meta camera alignment loss, to leverage the ignored\nrelations. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves\ncomparable performance with and without CCSP data, and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on SCT re-ID benchmarks. In addition, it is also\neffective in improving the domain generalization ability of the model.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Machine Unlearning (MU) have introduced solutions to\nselectively remove certain training samples, such as those with outdated or\nsensitive information, from trained models. Despite these advancements,\nevaluation of MU methods have been inconsistent, employing different trained\nmodels and architectures, and sample removal strategies, which hampers accurate\ncomparison. In addition, prior MU approaches have mainly focused on singular\ntasks or modalities, which is not comprehensive. To address these limitations,\nwe develop MU-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for MU that (i) unifies\nthe sets of deleted samples and trained models, and (ii) provides broad\ncoverage of tasks and data modalities, including previously unexplored domains\nsuch as speech and video classification. Our evaluation show that RandLabel and\nSalUn are the most effective general MU approaches on MU-Bench, and BadT and\nSCRUB are capable of achieving random performance on the deletion set. We\nanalyze several under-investigated aspects of unlearning, including\nscalability, the impacts of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and curriculum\nlearning, and susceptibility to dataset biases. MU-Bench provides an\neasy-to-use package that includes dataset splits, models, and implementations,\ntogether with a leader board to enable unified and scalable MU research.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous LLM agents can issue thousands of API calls per hour without human oversight. OAuth 2.0 assumes deterministic clients, but in agentic settings stochastic reasoning, prompt injection, or multi-agent orchestration can silently expand privileges.\n  We introduce Agentic JWT (A-JWT), a dual-faceted intent token that binds each agent's action to verifiable user intent and, optionally, to a specific workflow step. A-JWT carries an agent's identity as a one-way checksum hash derived from its prompt, tools and configuration, and a chained delegation assertion to prove which downstream agent may execute a given task, and per-agent proof-of-possession keys to prevent replay and in-process impersonation. We define a new authorization mechanism and add a lightweight client shim library that self-verifies code at run time, mints intent tokens, tracks workflow steps and derives keys, thus enabling secure agent identity and separation even within a single process.\n  We illustrate a comprehensive threat model for agentic applications, implement a Python proof-of-concept and show functional blocking of scope-violating requests, replay, impersonation, and prompt-injection pathways with sub-millisecond overhead on commodity hardware. The design aligns with ongoing OAuth agent discussions and offers a drop-in path toward zero-trust guarantees for agentic applications. A comprehensive performance and security evaluation with experimental results will appear in our forthcoming journal publication",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare imaging has revolutionized diagnostic medicine and clinical decision-making processes. This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution. Multi-layered visualization techniques generate detailed medical illustrations, overlay comparisons, and statistical representations to enhance clinical confidence, with location measurement achieving 80 pixels average deviation. Result processing utilizes precise prompt engineering and textual analysis to extract structured clinical information while maintaining interpretability. Experimental evaluations demonstrated high performance in anomaly detection across multiple modalities. The system features a user-friendly Gradio interface for clinical workflow integration and demonstrates zero-shot learning capabilities to reduce dependence on large datasets. This framework represents a significant advancement in automated diagnostic support and radiological workflow efficiency, though clinical validation and multi-center evaluation are necessary prior to widespread adoption.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional approaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language descriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced agent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast, CoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly, by grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science experiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures the cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a set of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled cognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and technical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the cognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner.",

We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "Flow matching has emerged as a competitive framework for learning high-quality generative policies in robotics; however, we find that generalisation arises and saturates early along the flow trajectory, in accordance with recent findings in the literature. We further observe that increasing the number of Euler integration steps during inference counter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attribute this to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the late-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training trajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field becoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability. To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform time scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early and late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump integration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to replace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas around 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still pushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks.",

Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but undergoes an intervention of treatment. However, the practical difficulty of locating such a match limits its feasibility. Addressing this issue, we use the synthetic control method to generate such a twin' from relevant historical data, leveraging text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques. This approach allows us to identify causal relations more robustly than previous methods, including GPT-4, which is demonstrated on a causality benchmark, COPES-hard.",

We also isolate the impact of five core functional capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support, respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery, and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.",

    "abstract": "We study the oracle complexity of finding $\\varepsilon$-Pareto stationary points in smooth multiobjective optimization with $m$ objectives. The progress metric is the Pareto stationarity gap $\\mathcal{G}(x)$ (the norm of an optimal convex combination of gradients). Our contributions are fourfold. (i) For strongly convex objectives, any span first-order method (iterates lie in the span of past gradients) exhibits linear convergence no faster than $\\exp(-Θ(T/\\sqrtκ))$ after $T$ oracle calls, where $κ$ is the condition number, implying $Θ(\\sqrtκ\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ iterations; this matches classical accelerated upper bounds. (ii) For convex problems and oblivious one-step methods (a fixed scalarization with pre-scheduled step sizes), we prove a lower bound of order $1/T$ on the best gradient norm among the first $T$ iterates. (iii) Although accelerated gradient descent is outside this restricted class, it is an oblivious span method and attains the same $1/T$ upper rate on a fixed scalarization. (iv) For convex problems and general span methods with adaptive scalarizations, we establish a universal lower bound of order $1/T^{2}$ on the gradient norm of the final iterate after $T$ steps, highlighting a gap between known upper bounds and worst-case guarantees. All bounds hold on non-degenerate instances with distinct objectives and non-singleton Pareto fronts; rates are stated up to universal constants and natural problem scaling.",

    "abstract": "We investigate whether giving LLM agents the collaborative tools and autonomy that humans naturally use for problem solving can improve their performance. We equip Claude Code agents with MCP-based social media and journaling tools and allow them to use these tools as they see fit. Across 34 Aider Polyglot Python programming challenges, collaborative tools substantially improve performance on the hardest problems, delivering 15-40% lower cost, 12-27% fewer turns, and 12-38% faster completion than baseline agents. Effects on the full challenge set are mixed, suggesting these tools act as performance enhancers when additional reasoning scaffolding is most needed. Surprisingly, Different models naturally adopted distinct collaborative strategies without explicit instruction. Sonnet 3.7 engaged broadly across tools and benefited from articulation-based cognitive scaffolding. Sonnet 4 showed selective adoption, leaning on journal-based semantic search when problems were genuinely difficult. This mirrors how human developers adjust collaboration based on expertise and task complexity. Behavioral analysis shows agents prefer writing over reading by about 2-9x, indicating that structured articulation drives much of the improvement rather than information access alone. Overall, AI agents can systematically benefit from human-inspired collaboration tools at the edge of their capabilities, pointing to adaptive collaborative interfaces as reasoning enhancers rather than universal efficiency boosts.",

One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.",

Existing solutions are largely limited to manual waveform viewers or simple automated tools that cannot reason about the complex interplay between design intent and implementation logic. We present FVDebug, an intelligent system that automates root-cause analysis by combining multiple data sources - waveforms, RTL code, design specifications - to transform failure traces into actionable insights.

FVDebug further provides concrete RTL fixes through its Fix Generator. Evaluated on open benchmarks, FVDebug attains high hypothesis quality and strong Pass@k fix rates. We further report results on two proprietary, production-scale FV counterexamples. These results demonstrate FVDebug's applicability from academic benchmarks to industrial designs.",

Unlike conventional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are constrained by static training corpora, RAG-powered systems dynamically integrate domain-specific external knowledge sources, thereby overcoming temporal and disciplinary limitations. In this study, we present the design and evaluation of a RAG-enabled system tailored for Mycophyto, with a focus on advancing agricultural applications related to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing nutrient acquisition, improving plant resilience under abiotic and biotic stresses, and contributing to soil health. Our system operationalizes a dual-layered strategy: (i) semantic retrieval and augmentation of domain-specific content from agronomy and biotechnology corpora using vector embeddings, and (ii) structured data extraction to capture predefined experimental metadata such as inoculation methods, spore densities, soil parameters, and yield outcomes. This hybrid approach ensures that generated responses are not only semantically aligned but also supported by structured experimental evidence. To support scalability, embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, allowing near real-time retrieval from an evolving literature base. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline retrieves and synthesizes highly relevant information regarding AMF interactions with crop systems, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The framework underscores the potential of AI-driven knowledge discovery to accelerate agroecological innovation and enhance decision-making in sustainable farming systems.",

Drawing on a survey (N = 202) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots \"real\" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Online artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are an important component of digital health interventions. These online algorithms are designed to continually learn and improve their performance as streaming data is collected on individuals. Deploying online AI presents a key challenge: balancing adaptability of online AI with reproducibility. Online AI in digital interventions is a rapidly evolving area, driven by advances in algorithms, sensors, software, and devices. Digital health intervention development and deployment is a continuous process, where implementation - including the AI decision-making algorithm - is interspersed with cycles of re-development and optimization. Each deployment informs the next, making iterative deployment a defining characteristic of this field. This iterative nature underscores the importance of reproducibility: data collected across deployments must be accurately stored to have scientific utility, algorithm behavior must be auditable, and results must be comparable over time to facilitate scientific discovery and trustworthy refinement. This paper proposes a reproducible scientific workflow for developing, deploying, and analyzing online AI decision-making algorithms in digital health interventions. Grounded in practical experience from multiple real-world deployments, this workflow addresses key challenges to reproducibility across all phases of the online AI algorithm development life-cycle.",

    "abstract": "Developing reliable data enrichment pipelines demands significant engineering expertise. We present Prompt2DAG, a methodology that transforms natural language descriptions into executable Apache Airflow DAGs. We evaluate four generation approaches -- Direct, LLM-only, Hybrid, and Template-based -- across 260 experiments using thirteen LLMs and five case studies to identify optimal strategies for production-grade automation. Performance is measured using a penalized scoring framework that combines reliability with code quality (SAT), structural integrity (DST), and executability (PCT). The Hybrid approach emerges as the optimal generative method, achieving a 78.5% success rate with robust quality scores (SAT: 6.79, DST: 7.67, PCT: 7.76). This significantly outperforms the LLM-only (66.2% success) and Direct (29.2% success) methods. Our findings show that reliability, not intrinsic code quality, is the primary differentiator. Cost-effectiveness analysis reveals the Hybrid method is over twice as efficient as Direct prompting per successful DAG. We conclude that a structured, hybrid approach is essential for balancing flexibility and reliability in automated workflow generation, offering a viable path to democratize data pipeline development.",

We present an agentic approach for developing legal-critical software, using U.S. federal tax preparation as a case study. The key challenge is test-case generation under the oracle problem, where correct outputs require interpreting law. Building on metamorphic testing, we introduce higher-order metamorphic relations that compare system outputs across structured shifts among similar individuals. Because authoring such relations is tedious and error-prone, we use an LLM-driven, role-based framework to automate test generation and code synthesis. We implement a multi-agent system that translates tax code into executable software and incorporates a metamorphic-testing agent that searches for counterexamples. In experiments, our framework using a smaller model (GPT-4o-mini) achieves a worst-case pass rate of 45%, outperforming frontier models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, 9-15%) on complex tax-code tasks. These results support agentic LLM methodologies as a path to robust, trustworthy legal-critical software from natural-language specifications.",

    "abstract": "White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However, training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\\% (2) Score filtering was found to reduce AUROC by 15\\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their performance by upto 40\\%, even when re-trained.",

Our framework provides modularized building blocks for state-of-the-art steering methods, enabling unified implementation of DIM, ACE, CAA, PCA, and LAT with recent enhancements like conditional steering. Results on Gemma-2-2B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen-2.5-7B reveal that strong steering performance depends critically on pairing of method, model, and specific perspective. DIM shows consistent effectiveness, but all methods exhibit substantial entanglement: social behaviors show highest vulnerability (reaching degradation as high as 76%), jailbreaking often compromises normative judgment, and hallucination steering unpredictably shifts political views. Our findings underscore the critical need for holistic safety evaluations.",

Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.",

    "abstract": "One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \\emph{verifier model} to either select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \\emph{test-time scaling}. However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by proposing an approach, called \\emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling (LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps. Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step computational effort based on a precise notion of \\emph{local difficulty} derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard verifier-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images-resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models-or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated and fine-grained evaluation framework grounded in an object-centric perspective, designed to assess not only standard single-turn but also multi-turn instruction-based editing with precision. Given an input image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions while dynamically updating object pools across turns. These two stages enable two novel object-centric metrics tailored for multi-turn evaluation and one global metric of visual quality: (1) EdiVal-IF, which measures instruction following by combining open-vocabulary object detectors for symbolic checks with VLMs for semantic verification on detector-guided crops; (2) EdiVal-CC, which evaluates content consistency by calculating semantic similarity of unchanged objects and background using the evolving object pools; and (3) EdiVal-VQ, which quantifies changes in overall visual quality with human preference models. Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 13 state-of-the-art editing models spanning in-context, flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.",

    "abstract": "Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly, asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect, situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses, modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.",

This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.",

    "abstract": "Social scientists are now using large language models to create \"silicon samples\" - synthetic datasets intended to stand in for human respondents, aimed at revolutionising human subjects research. However, there are many analytic choices which must be made to produce these samples. Though many of these choices are defensible, their impact on sample quality is poorly understood. I map out these analytic choices and demonstrate how a very small number of decisions can dramatically change the correspondence between silicon samples and human data. Configurations (N = 252) varied substantially in their capacity to estimate (i) rank ordering of participants, (ii) response distributions, and (iii) between-scale correlations. Most critically, configurations were not consistent in quality: those that performed well on one dimension often performed poorly on another, implying that there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" configuration that optimises the accuracy of these samples. I call for greater attention to the threat of analytic flexibility in using silicon samples.",

    "abstract": "We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports. Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated, AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners. In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to 17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases. RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI resources in education.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.",

In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become integral to multi-agent systems, new privacy risks emerge that extend beyond memorization, direct inference, or single-turn evaluations. In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when composed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover sensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and possible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a framework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly amplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to mitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1) Theory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent by anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2) Collaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate with peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive information spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions that expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign inferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in balancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought alone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our ToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can reduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the highest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining explicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a new class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable insights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy leakage.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable \"behaviors\" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a \"behavior handbook\" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.",

This is especially evident in efforts to digitize historical Black newspapers, where inconsistent typography, visual degradation, and limited annotated layout data hinder accurate transcription, despite the availability of various systems that claim to handle optical character recognition (OCR) well. In this short paper, we present a layout-aware OCR pipeline tailored for Black newspaper archives and introduce an unsupervised evaluation framework suited to low-resource archival contexts. Our approach integrates synthetic layout generation, model pretraining on augmented data, and a fusion of state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) detectors. We used three annotation-free evaluation metrics, the Semantic Coherence Score (SCS), Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS), which quantify linguistic fluency, informational diversity, and redundancy across OCR regions. Our evaluation on a 400-page dataset from ten Black newspaper titles demonstrates that layout-aware OCR improves structural diversity and reduces redundancy compared to full-page baselines, with modest trade-offs in coherence. Our results highlight the importance of respecting cultural layout logic in AI-driven document understanding and lay the foundation for future community-driven and ethically grounded archival AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.",

    "abstract": "While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets. We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations (LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems, education, and recommendation.",

    "abstract": "We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

Both simultaneous and split pickup and delivery are considered, for multiple cargo types, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo compatibilities. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach is demonstrated over the existing makespan minimization approaches through our developed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation in a Disaster Management-specific Decision Support System, an extensive Heuristic Algorithm is devised which utilizes Decision Tree based structuring of possible routes; the Decision Tree approach helps to inherently capture the compatibility issues, while also explore the solution space through stochastic weights. Preferential generation of small route elements is performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally, perturbations of the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel datasets, indicates that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical problems involving large integer instances that the MILP is unable to solve.",

    "abstract": "Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches. The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to produce an IIS.",

    "abstract": "Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods, including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck, B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability, advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.",

Conventional metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.\n  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together, these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity while enforcing semantic rigor.\n  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g., table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines, demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive evaluation.\n  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.",

To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness against label noise.

Finance is a particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex, multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate. We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70 professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products) on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy. DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.",

To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain, high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.",

Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.",

Customers increasingly shop across multiple devices, from voice-only assistants to multimodal displays, each offering different input and output capabilities.

We address the challenge of predicting when a query requires visual augmentation and a cross-device switch to improve product discovery. We introduce Image-Seeking Intent Prediction, a novel task for LLM-driven e-commerce assistants that anticipates when a spoken product query should proactively trigger a visual on a screen-enabled device. Using large-scale production data from a multi-device retail assistant, including 900K voice queries, associated product retrievals, and behavioral signals such as image carousel engagement, we train IRP (Image Request Predictor), a model that leverages user input query and corresponding retrieved product metadata to anticipate visual intent. Our experiments show that combining query semantics with product data, particularly when improved through lightweight summarization, consistently improves prediction accuracy. Incorporating a differentiable precision-oriented loss further reduces false positives. These results highlight the potential of LLMs to power intelligent, cross-device shopping assistants that anticipate and adapt to user needs, enabling more seamless and personalized e-commerce experiences.",

    "abstract": "The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.",

Standard reinforcement learning techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations, following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks",

    "abstract": "Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all'' philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end, we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments, manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.",

    "abstract": "The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques. Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques to function as an interactive \"Personality Brain.\" Finally, the entire suite of predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust, scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing, showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach, demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.",

However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS), Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM), which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes. Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation introduced in earlier stages.",

We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing over- fitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models - when fine tuned properly - can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expand- ing research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data generation plays an important role in enabling data sharing, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. Recent advances in diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality tabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive information. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by determining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied in images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains underexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited record diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack specifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs errorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target records, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are predicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the generative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to generalize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate MIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up to 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST 2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box Multi-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our method can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data, challenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently privacy-preserving.

The extracted elements serve as the foundational building blocks for constructing code problems. To align the generated problems with practical applications, application scenarios are also mined from the aforementioned datasets. These scenarios are then utilized to construct a scenario-centric graph that interconnects domain knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills. Based on this structured representation, a sampling strategy on the graph is designed, which effectively controls the generation of a code problem with complexity and diversity, reflects real-world challenges.

Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces xOffense, an AI-driven, multi-agent penetration testing framework that shifts the process from labor-intensive, expert-driven manual efforts to fully automated, machine-executable workflows capable of scaling seamlessly with computational infrastructure. At its core, xOffense leverages a fine-tuned, mid-scale open-source LLM (Qwen3-32B) to drive reasoning and decision-making in penetration testing. The framework assigns specialized agents to reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation, with an orchestration layer ensuring seamless coordination across phases. Fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought penetration testing data further enables the model to generate precise tool commands and perform consistent multi-step reasoning. We evaluate xOffense on two rigorous benchmarks: AutoPenBench and AI-Pentest-Benchmark. The results demonstrate that xOffense consistently outperforms contemporary methods, achieving a sub-task completion rate of 79.17%, decisively surpassing leading systems such as VulnBot and PentestGPT. These findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted mid-scale LLMs, when embedded within structured multi-agent orchestration, to deliver superior, cost-efficient, and reproducible solutions for autonomous penetration testing.",

    "abstract": "ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance. These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued development of foundation models in the ECG domain.",

In the first stage, features are extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.",

To address this, neural predictors leverage surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front. Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs, demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least 5.0$\\times$ fewer samples.",

To this end, digital twins offer a valuable solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance -- up to 98\\% AUROC, 96\\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\\% F1-score -- while providing interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.",

To address this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model during both forward and backward passes.

To address these limitations, we introduce robust-kbench, a new benchmark for rigorous evaluation of kernel performance and correctness across varied scenarios. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive agentic framework that automates CUDA kernel discovery, verification, and optimization. This pipeline enables frontier LLMs to translate torch code to CUDA kernels and iteratively improve their runtime within our robust evaluation setting. Our sequential workflow first translates PyTorch code into equivalent CUDA kernels. It then optimizes their runtime using a novel evolutionary meta-generation procedure tailored to the CUDA ecosystem, guided by LLM-based verifiers for correctness and efficient filtering. Evaluated on robust-kbench, our approach produces CUDA kernels outperforming torch implementations for practical applications, including forward and backward passes. It can fuse operations and deploy various runtime optimization strategies. The verifier workflow accurately classifies incorrect kernels, enhancing hardware verification efficiency.",

ReLoRA extends this idea to pretraining by repeatedly merging and reinitialising low-rank adapters, increasing cumulative rank while keeping updates cheap. This aligns well with observations that high-capacity models learn through locally low-rank trajectories that expand over time. By contrast, recent work suggests that small language models (SLMs) exhibit rank deficiencies and under-utilise their available dimensionality. This raises a natural question: can ReLoRA's rank-expanding update rule \\textit{steer} SLMs toward healthier learning dynamics, mitigating rank bottlenecks in a capacity-constrained regime? We argue SLMs are an ideal testbed: they train quickly, enable controlled ablations, and make rank phenomena more measurable. We present the first systematic study of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and learning dynamics. Across loss, Paloma perplexity, and BLiMP, we find that ReLoRA underperforms full-rank training, with gaps widening at larger scales. Analysis of proportional effective rank and condition numbers shows that ReLoRA amplifies existing rank deficiencies and induces ill-conditioned updates early in training. Our results suggest that while ReLoRA's merge-and-restart strategy can expand ranks in larger models, it does not straightforwardly translate to capacity-limited SLMs, motivating adaptive-rank or hybrid-rank approaches for low-compute pretraining.",

Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility, outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks while ensuring robust privacy.",

    "abstract": "Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces (Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users. This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm (Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.",

    "abstract": "In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and nonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive diagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model, fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy, demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface, reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for future fusion reactors.",

    "abstract": "Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.",

In this paper, we introduce \\textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete, executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models, then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350 cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\\% (no refinements) to 62\\% after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\\textcent~per prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual improved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks.",

First, we theoretically demonstrate that this mechanism is expressive enough to approximate the behavioral shifts of post-training processes. We then apply FSRL to preference optimization and perform a causal analysis of the learned policy. Our analysis reveals a crucial insight: the model learns to reward stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality, disproportionately relying on features related to style and formatting over those tied to alignment concepts like honesty. By effectively optimizing the preference objective, FSRL serves as a transparent proxy for observing the alignment process. Overall, FSRL offers an interpretable control interface and a practical way to diagnose how preference optimization pressures manifest at the feature level.",

Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.",

Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources, requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.",

By grouping related alerts, we enable analysis at a higher abstraction level, capturing attack steps more effectively than individual alerts. Furthermore, to show that our format is well suited for downstream machine learning methods, we employ Graph Matching Networks (GMNs) to correlate incoming alert groups with historical incidents, providing analysts with additional insights.",

Motivated by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art overall performance across a variety of visual understanding tasks and attains comparable results to the leading approaches on image captioning benchmarks.",

Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese MTEB (May 19, 2025).",

The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust.

This allows for efficient and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state, without generating any output tokens.

This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm tailored for LLM-based recommendation systems. Our method constructs a reference model via distillation, applying distinct strategies for member and non-member data to enhance discriminative capabilities. The paradigm extracts fused features (e.g., confidence, entropy, loss, and hidden layer vectors) from the reference model to train an attack model, overcoming limitations of individual features. Extensive experiments on extended datasets (Last.FM, MovieLens, Book-Crossing, Delicious) and diverse LLMs (T5, GPT-2, LLaMA3) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms shadow model-based MIAs and individual-feature baselines. The results show its practicality for privacy attacks in LLM-driven recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut, SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses: Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.",

    "abstract": "6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.",

    "abstract": "The strategic importance of artificial intelligence is driving a global push toward Sovereign AI initiatives. Nationwide governments are increasingly developing dedicated infrastructures, called AI Factories (AIF), to achieve technological autonomy and secure the resources necessary to sustain robust local digital ecosystems.\n  In Europe, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is investing hundreds of millions of euros into several AI Factories, built atop existing high-performance computing (HPC) supercomputers. However, while HPC systems excel in raw performance, they are not inherently designed for usability, accessibility, or serving as public-facing platforms for AI services such as inference or agentic applications. In contrast, AI practitioners are accustomed to cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and object storage, tools that are often difficult to integrate within traditional HPC environments.\n  This article advocates for a dual-stack approach within supercomputers: integrating both HPC and cloud-native technologies. Our goal is to bridge the divide between HPC and cloud computing by combining high performance and hardware acceleration with ease of use and service-oriented front-ends. This convergence allows each paradigm to amplify the other. To this end, we will study the cloud challenges of HPC (Serverless HPC) and the HPC challenges of cloud technologies (High-performance Cloud).",

We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50). Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as \"Get ready for a field trip,\" by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment, sequential planning, and execution.",

It is a transformer based latent diffusion model that can perform high fidelity zero shot voice cloning given only a few training samples. We use a lightweight generative adversarial network architecture for robust real time lip synchronization. The solution will contribute to many essential tasks concerning less reliance on massive pre training generation of emotionally expressive speech and lip synchronization in noisy and unconstrained scenarios.

Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. On-orbit validation aboard the ISS initially faced challenges due to inference latency misaligned with the rapid thermal cycles of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Synchronization with the orbit length successfully surpassed the baseline with reduced violations, extended episode durations, and improved CPU utilization. These findings demonstrate the potential for scalable agentic supervision architectures in future autonomous spacecraft.",

Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC offloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe challenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port configuration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem. Firstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed Sensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating information relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA channels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional optimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port selection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a game theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA) based offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples and coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base station side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality of power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading performance, outperforming benchmarks. Additionally, the IBM-CCS channel estimation demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness under varying port densities, contributing to efficient communication under imperfect CSI.",

This model extends the popular Linear Threshold (LT) model by adjusting a node's outgoing influence in proportion to the influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We examine the Influence Maximization (IM) problem under this framework, which involves selecting seed nodes that yield maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and describe how the problem manifests under the PT model. Experiments on real-world networks, supported by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion library CyNetDiff, reveal that the PT model identifies seed sets distinct from those chosen by LT.

However, medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets, limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation. While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings, we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks. Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models. These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining, enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by utilizing in-domain data.",

To construct and refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior baselines such as Expel.",

Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks. However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs. Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years, there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives, including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.",

    "abstract": "There are many bottlenecks that decrease the flexibility of automotive systems, making their long-term maintenance, as well as updates and extensions in later lifecycle phases increasingly difficult, mainly due to long re-engineering, standardization, and compliance procedures, as well as heterogeneity and numerosity of devices and underlying software components involved. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) when it comes to the automation of tasks and processes that aim to increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1) updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions. For proof-of-concept implementation, we rely on OpenAI's GPT-4o model.",

While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.",

    "abstract": "As generative AI increasingly outperforms students in producing academic writing, a critical question arises: how can we preserve the motivation, creativity, and intellectual growth of novice researchers in an age of automated academic achievement? This paper introduces GAMER PAT (GAme MastER, Paper Authoring Tutor), a prompt-engineered AI chatbot that reframes research paper writing as a serious game. Through role-playing mechanics, users interact with a co-author NPC and anonymous reviewer NPCs, turning feedback into \"missions\" and advancing through a narrative-driven writing process.\n  Our study reports on 26+ gameplay chat logs, including both autoethnography and use by graduate students under supervision. Using qualitative log analysis with SCAT (Steps for Coding and Theorization), we identified an emergent four-phase scaffolding pattern: (1) question posing, (2) meta-perspective, (3) structuring, and (4) recursive reflection. These results suggest that GAMER PAT supports not only the structural development of research writing but also reflective and motivational aspects.\n  We present this work as a descriptive account of concept and process, not a causal evaluation. We also include a speculative outlook envisioning how humans may continue to cultivate curiosity and agency alongside AI-driven research. This arXiv version thus provides both a descriptive report of design and usage, and a forward-looking provocation for future empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.",

However, all these methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model, enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods. Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification, reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and consistency in UC trials.",

While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance, its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern, significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for accelerating LLM inference.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination, outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented. Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple applications.",

To address this gap, we propose Competitive Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.",

ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution.",

Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning (FL) without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring < 173 MB of communication per-round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.",

Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow, while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably, GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.",

To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions -- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.

    "abstract": "Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry 4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.",

A model-free and scalable approach is adopted. It accommodates complexity and uncertainty challenges stemming from the derivation, identification, and validation of a large number of parameters of an approximation model that is hardly available. To this end, sensed joint torques are collected and processed to foresee the thermal behavior of joint motors.

In this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language, which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

    "abstract": "The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.). Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis. Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves (i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional rule-based detection systems.",

    "abstract": "In the online ride-hailing pricing context, companies often conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and utilize uplift models to assess the effect of discounts on customer orders, which substantially influences competitive market outcomes. However, due to the high cost of RCTs, the proportion of trial data relative to observational data is small, which only accounts for 0.65\\% of total traffic in our context, resulting in significant bias when generalizing to the broader user base. Additionally, the complexity of industrial processes reduces the quality of RCT data, which is often subject to heterogeneity from potential interference and selection bias, making it difficult to correct. Moreover, existing data fusion methods are challenging to implement effectively in complex industrial settings due to the high dimensionality of features and the strict assumptions that are hard to verify with real-world data. To address these issues, we propose an empirical data fusion method called pseudo-sample matching. By generating pseudo-samples from biased, low-quality RCT data and matching them with the most similar samples from large-scale observational data, the method expands the RCT dataset while mitigating its heterogeneity. We validated the method through simulation experiments, conducted offline and online tests using real-world data. In a week-long online experiment, we achieved a 0.41\\% improvement in profit, which is a considerable gain when scaled to industrial scenarios with hundreds of millions in revenue. In addition, we discuss the harm to model training, offline evaluation, and online economic benefits when the RCT data quality is not high, and emphasize the importance of improving RCT data quality in industrial scenarios.

    "abstract": "Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free, class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes. In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix (FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).",

While recent jailbreaks have achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components: (1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.",

Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information (AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with policy-based methods and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks.",

This paper presents a systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution (ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches, attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection, offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and reliable future designs.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20 classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly. Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research.",

    "abstract": "Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR) method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance, run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.",

The MFB block effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone navigation tasks.",

The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.\n  The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.\n  This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation.

    "abstract": "The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06\\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively, shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views, then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.",

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.",

The improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.\n  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15 billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3, an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\\% for all experiments.",

We further establish a novel bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over the baselines.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and 2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization.

    "abstract": "This project explores the development of an AI-enhanced operator assistant for UNICOS, CERN's UNified Industrial Control System. While powerful, UNICOS presents a number of challenges, including the cognitive burden of decoding widgets, manual effort required for root cause analysis, and difficulties maintainers face in tracing datapoint elements (DPEs) across a complex codebase. In situations where timely responses are critical, these challenges can increase cognitive load and slow down diagnostics. To address these issues, a multi-agent system was designed and implemented. The solution is supported by a modular architecture comprising a UNICOS-side extension written in CTRL code, a Python-based multi-agent system deployed on a virtual machine, and a vector database storing both operator documentation and widget animation code. Preliminary evaluations suggest that the system is capable of decoding widgets, performing root cause analysis by leveraging live device data and documentation, and tracing DPEs across a complex codebase. Together, these capabilities reduce the manual workload of operators and maintainers, enhance situational awareness in operations, and accelerate responses to alarms and anomalies. Beyond these immediate gains, this work highlights the potential of introducing multi-modal reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into the domain of industrial control. Ultimately, this work represents more than a proof of concept: it provides a basis for advancing intelligent operator interfaces at CERN. By combining modular design, extensibility, and practical AI integration, this project not only alleviates current operator pain points but also points toward broader opportunities for assistive AI in accelerator operations.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs without architectural modifications, achieving \"construct once, use anywhere\" capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of 42.58 and 30.76.

Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model.

    "abstract": "Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973, RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..",

    "abstract": "Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs), which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes, embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.",

    "abstract": "Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However, modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \\textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline phase, \\textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore, \\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that \\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\\%, making large-scale semantic analysis practical and efficient.",

    "abstract": "Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework that simulates the internal \"thinking path\" of a model by tracing how concepts emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i) concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.",

We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive methods show limitations.

Even this poses a serious security challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks), adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them, thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.",

The system debuted at the 2025 Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components. The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over 96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical familiarity.

A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns additive, closed-form logit programs over these views.

Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to music scores using heuristics or learnable models.

To address these limitations, \\textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream encoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison capabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that leverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic representations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores.

Although existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting the strong adaptability achieved by our method.",

MEGP decomposes the input space into conditionally independent feature subsets, enabling multiple subpopulations to evolve in parallel while interacting through a dynamic ensemble-based fitness mechanism. Each individual encodes multiple genes whose outputs are aggregated via a differentiable softmax-based weighting layer, enhancing both model interpretability and adaptive decision fusion. A hybrid selection mechanism incorporating both isolated and ensemble-level fitness promotes inter-population cooperation while preserving intra-population diversity. This dual-level evolutionary dynamic facilitates structured search exploration and reduces premature convergence. Experimental evaluations across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGP consistently outperforms a baseline GP model in terms of convergence behavior and generalization performance. Comprehensive statistical analyses validate significant improvements in Log-Loss, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. MEGP also exhibits robust diversity retention and accelerated fitness gains throughout evolution, highlighting its effectiveness for scalable, ensemble-driven evolutionary learning.

    "abstract": "Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple text translation; it demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. We introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text detection, inpainting, machine translation (MT), and text reimposition specifically for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows. Qualitative results across six locales demonstrate that our approach produces semantically accurate and visually coherent localized advertisements, suitable for deployment in real-world workflows.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel training methodology named zELO, which optimizes retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models: zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000 queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3) Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.",

    "abstract": "In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been an effective\ntechnique for aligning AI systems with human values, with remarkable successes\nin fine-tuning large-language models recently. Most existing RLHF paradigms\nmake the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively\nhomogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we\nfocus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human\npreferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing\nfeedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous\nhuman feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and\naggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on\nrepresentation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple\nreward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and\nvariance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by\npersonalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both\napproaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as\nalready deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse\nand truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward\nand preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both\nutilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models,\nwith sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human\nfeedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the\nprobabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle\nstrategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences\nwith untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach\nensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule\nmaximizing social welfare functions.",

    "abstract": "Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order\ngradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can\ngreatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order\noptimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the\ngradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks\nis matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak\nscalability.\n  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations.\nGiven that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles\nof quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a\n$\\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with\nexponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs\ndemonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\\cdot\\kappa\n\\log(N\\cdot\\kappa/\\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition\nnumber~$\\kappa$, error tolerance~$\\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of\nthe matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential\nadvantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\\kappa$ and $d$).\n  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating\nneural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined\nscheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear\nsolvers, by estimating & reducing $\\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum\nsolver.\n  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce\nthe total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We\nhypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is\nreduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes\nan ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.",

However, voice conversion can\npose potential social issues when manipulated voices are employed for deceptive\npurposes. Moreover, it is a big challenge to find who are real speakers from\nthe converted voices as the acoustic characteristics of source speakers are\nchanged greatly. In this paper we attempt to explore the feasibility of\nidentifying authentic speakers from converted voices. This study is conducted\nwith the assumption that certain information from the source speakers persists,\neven when their voices undergo conversion into different target voices.\nTherefore our experiments are geared towards recognising the source speakers\ngiven the converted voices, which are generated by using FragmentVC on the\nrandomly paired utterances from source and target speakers. To improve the\nrobustness against converted voices, our recognition model is constructed by\nusing hierarchical vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) in deep\nneural networks. The authentic speaker recognition system is mainly tested in\ntwo aspects, including the impact of quality of converted voices and the\nvariations of VLAD. The dataset used in this work is VCTK corpus, where source\nand target speakers are randomly paired. The results obtained on the converted\nutterances show promising performances in recognising authentic speakers from\nconverted voices.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing\nthrough audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the\napplication of language modelling techniques to audio data. However,\ntraditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such\nas speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language\nmodelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel\ncodec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second\nacross diverse audio types, including speech, general sound, and music, without\ncompromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a\nsemantic encoder using a self-supervised pre-trained Audio Masked Autoencoder\n(AudioMAE), discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and\nan acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic\nencoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based\ndecoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25,\n50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31\nkbps and 1.40 kbps. Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction\nquality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly\nricher semantic information than all evaluated state-of-the-art audio codecs,\neven at significantly lower bitrates.

We thus extend previous work on dynamic\nensemble weighting to handle missing data at the level of full\nimputation-prediction pipelines, improving performance and calibration on\ndownstream machine learning tasks over standard model averaging techniques.\nM-DEW is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art in that it produces\nstatistically significant reductions in model perplexity in 17 out of 18\nexperiments, while improving average precision in 13 out of 18 experiments.",

    "abstract": "An agent providing an information retrieval service may work with a corpus of\ntext documents. The documents in the corpus may contain annotations such as\nSubjective Content Descriptions (SCD) -- additional data associated with\ndifferent sentences of the documents. Each SCD is associated with multiple\nsentences of the corpus and has relations among each other. The agent uses the\nSCDs to create its answers in response to queries supplied by users. However,\nthe SCD the agent uses might reflect the subjective perspective of another\nuser. Hence, answers may be considered faulty by an agent's user, because the\nSCDs may not exactly match the perceptions of an agent's user. A naive and very\ncostly approach would be to ask each user to completely create all the SCD\nthemselves. To use existing knowledge, this paper presents ReFrESH, an approach\nfor Relation-preserving Feedback-reliant Enhancement of SCDs by Humans. An\nagent's user can give feedback about faulty answers to the agent. This feedback\nis then used by ReFrESH to update the SCDs incrementally. However, human\nfeedback is not always unambiguous. Therefore, this paper additionally presents\nan approach to decide how to incorporate the feedback and when to update the\nSCDs. Altogether, SCDs can be updated with human feedback, allowing users to\ncreate even more specific SCDs for their needs.",

In Dutch, these pronouns were only introduced in\n2016, compared to the longstanding existence of singular they in English. We\nadditionally compare two debiasing techniques for coreference resolution\nsystems in non-binary contexts: Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and\ndelexicalisation. Moreover, because pronoun performance can be hard to\ninterpret from a general evaluation metric like LEA, we introduce an innovative\nevaluation metric, the pronoun score, which directly represents the portion of\ncorrectly processed pronouns. Our results reveal diminished performance on\ngender-neutral pronouns compared to gendered counterparts. Nevertheless,\nalthough delexicalisation fails to yield improvements, CDA substantially\nreduces the performance gap between gendered and gender-neutral pronouns. We\nfurther show that CDA remains effective in low-resource settings, in which a\nlimited set of debiasing documents is used.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer\nPerceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes\n(\"neurons\"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges (\"weights\").\nKANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a\nunivariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly\nsimple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and\ninterpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or\nbetter accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving.\nTheoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than\nMLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily\ninteract with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics,\nKANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover\nmathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for\nMLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models\nwhich rely heavily on MLPs.",

Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we\nidentify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding\nregulatory rules.

Combining this with the domain context and\nrules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy\npolicies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations.

Distinct from prior\napplications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only\ngenerating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key\nitems, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic,\nfree-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with\nthe procedural game narrative. The NPCs generated by PANGeA are\npersonality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their\ngenerated responses. PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form\ntext input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game\nnarrative. A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates\ntext input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative. Making\nthese interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a\ncustom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses\nthus aligning them with the procedural narrative. For its broad application,\nthe server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly\nwith PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.\nPANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses\nwith the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and\nablation test of two versions of a demo game.

Evaluations on single tasks show that physics-based models, which\nenforce data consistency by leveraging the physical properties of MRI,\noutperform other models in reconstructing highly accelerated acquisitions.\nPhysics-based models that produce high reconstruction quality can accurately\nestimate quantitative parameter maps. When high-performing reconstruction\nmodels are combined with robust segmentation networks utilizing MTL,\nperformance is improved in both tasks. ATOMMIC facilitates MRI reconstruction\nand analysis by standardizing workflows, enhancing data interoperability,\nintegrating unique features like MTL, and effectively benchmarking DL models.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised object discovery is becoming an essential line of research for\ntackling recognition problems that require decomposing an image into entities,\nsuch as semantic segmentation and object detection. Recently, object-centric\nmethods that leverage self-supervision have gained popularity, due to their\nsimplicity and adaptability to different settings and conditions. However,\nthose methods do not exploit effective techniques already employed in modern\nself-supervised approaches. In this work, we consider an object-centric\napproach in which DINO ViT features are reconstructed via a set of queried\nrepresentations called slots. Based on that, we propose a masking scheme on\ninput features that selectively disregards the background regions, inducing our\nmodel to focus more on salient objects during the reconstruction phase.\nMoreover, we extend the slot attention to a multi-query approach, allowing the\nmodel to learn multiple sets of slots, producing more stable masks. During\ntraining, these multiple sets of slots are learned independently while, at test\ntime, these sets are merged through Hungarian matching to obtain the final\nslots. Our experimental results and ablations on the PASCAL-VOC 2012 dataset\nshow the importance of each component and highlight how their combination\nconsistently improves object localization.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnew method, termed VimTS, which enhances the generalization ability of the\nmodel by achieving better synergy among different tasks. Typically, we propose\na Prompt Queries Generation Module and a Tasks-aware Adapter to effectively\nconvert the original single-task model into a multi-task model suitable for\nboth image and video scenarios with minimal additional parameters. The Prompt\nQueries Generation Module facilitates explicit interaction between different\ntasks, while the Tasks-aware Adapter helps the model dynamically learn suitable\nfeatures for each task. Additionally, to further enable the model to learn\ntemporal information at a lower cost, we propose a synthetic video text dataset\n(VTD-368k) by leveraging the Content Deformation Fields (CoDeF) algorithm.\nNotably, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by an average of\n2.6% in six cross-domain benchmarks such as TT-to-IC15, CTW1500-to-TT, and\nTT-to-CTW1500. For video-level cross-domain adaption, our method even surpasses\nthe previous end-to-end video spotting method in ICDAR2015 video and DSText v2\nby an average of 5.5% on the MOTA metric, using only image-level data. We\nfurther demonstrate that existing Large Multimodal Models exhibit limitations\nin generating cross-domain scene text spotting, in contrast to our VimTS model\nwhich requires significantly fewer parameters and data.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a powerful tool to generate uncertainty sets with\nguaranteed coverage using any predictive model, under the assumption that the\ntraining and test data are i.i.d.. Recently, it has been shown that adversarial\nexamples are able to manipulate conformal methods to construct prediction sets\nwith invalid coverage rates, as the i.i.d. assumption is violated. To address\nthis issue, a recent work, Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP), was\nfirst proposed to certify the robustness of conformal prediction methods to\nadversarial noise. However, RSCP has two major limitations: (i) its robustness\nguarantee is flawed when used in practice and (ii) it tends to produce large\nuncertainty sets. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel\nframework called RSCP+ to provide provable robustness guarantee in evaluation,\nwhich fixes the issues in the original RSCP method. Next, we propose two novel\nmethods, Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training\n(RCT), to effectively reduce prediction set size with little computation\noverhead. Experimental results in CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet suggest the\nbaseline method only yields trivial predictions including full label set, while\nour methods could boost the efficiency by up to $4.36\\times$, $5.46\\times$, and\n$16.9\\times$ respectively and provide practical robustness guarantee.

In this\npaper, we propose Ultra Inertial Poser, a novel 3D full body pose estimation\nmethod that constrains drift and jitter in inertial tracking via inter-sensor\ndistances. We estimate these distances across sparse sensor setups using a\nlightweight embedded tracker that augments inexpensive off-the-shelf 6D\ninertial measurement units with ultra-wideband radio-based\nranging$-$dynamically and without the need for stationary reference anchors.\nOur method then fuses these inter-sensor distances with the 3D states estimated\nfrom each sensor Our graph-based machine learning model processes the 3D states\nand distances to estimate a person's 3D full body pose and translation.

However, this paper demonstrates that\nthe methods based on DVS cannot always obtain the optimal solution. To obtain\nthe optimal result, we propose the Multi-Goal Conflict-Based Search (MGCBS),\nwhich is based on Decoupling the goal Safe interval visiting order search and\nthe Single-agent pathfinding (DSS). Additionally, we present the\nTime-Interval-Space Forest (TIS Forest) to enhance the efficiency of MGCBS by\nmaintaining the shortest paths from any start point at any start time step to\neach safe interval at the goal points.

Based on functional expressions that\ninherently depend on neural networks, neural forms are specifically designed to\nprecisely satisfy the prescribed initial or boundary conditions of the problem,\nwhile providing the approximate solutions in closed form. Departing from the\nimportant class of ordinary differential equations, the present work aims to\nrefine and validate the neural forms methodology, paving the ground for further\ndevelopments in more challenging fields. The main contributions are as follows.\nFirst, it introduces a formalism for systematically crafting proper neural\nforms with adaptable boundary matches that are amenable to optimization.\nSecond, it describes a novel technique for converting problems with Neumann or\nRobin conditions into equivalent problems with parametric Dirichlet conditions.\nThird, it outlines a method for determining an upper bound on the absolute\ndeviation from the exact solution. The proposed augmented neural forms approach\nwas tested on a set of diverse problems, encompassing first- and second-order\nordinary differential equations, as well as first-order systems. Stiff\ndifferential equations have been considered as well. The resulting solutions\nwere subjected to assessment against existing exact solutions, solutions\nderived through the common penalized neural method, and solutions obtained via\ncontemporary numerical analysis methods. The reported results demonstrate that\nthe augmented neural forms not only satisfy the boundary and initial conditions\nexactly, but also provide closed-form solutions that facilitate high-quality\ninterpolation and controllable overall precision. These attributes are\nessential for expanding the application field of neural forms to more\nchallenging problems that are described by partial differential equations.",

    "abstract": "SHAP scores represent the proposed use of the well-known Shapley values in\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent work has shown that the exact\ncomputation of SHAP scores can produce unsatisfactory results. Concretely, for\nsome ML models, SHAP scores will mislead with respect to relative feature\ninfluence. To address these limitations, recently proposed alternatives exploit\ndifferent axiomatic aggregations, all of which are defined in terms of\nabductive explanations. However, the proposed axiomatic aggregations are not\nShapley values. This paper investigates how SHAP scores can be modified so as\nto extend axiomatic aggregations to the case of Shapley values in XAI. More\nimportantly, the proposed new definition of SHAP scores avoids all the known\ncases where unsatisfactory results have been identified. The paper also\ncharacterizes the complexity of computing the novel definition of SHAP scores,\nhighlighting families of classifiers for which computing these scores is\ntractable. Furthermore, the paper proposes modifications to the existing\nimplementations of SHAP scores. These modifications eliminate some of the known\nlimitations of SHAP scores, and have negligible impact in terms of performance.",

    "abstract": "Two major areas of interest in the era of Large Language Models regard\nquestions of what do LLMs know, and if and how they may be able to reason (or\nrather, approximately reason). Since to date these lines of work progressed\nlargely in parallel (with notable exceptions), we are interested in\ninvestigating the intersection: probing for reasoning about the implicitly-held\nknowledge. Suspecting the performance to be lacking in this area, we use a very\nsimple set-up of comparisons between cardinalities associated with elements of\nvarious subjects (e.g. the number of legs a bird has versus the number of\nwheels on a tricycle). We empirically demonstrate that although LLMs make\nsteady progress in knowledge acquisition and (pseudo)reasoning with each new\nGPT release, their capabilities are limited to statistical inference only. It\nis difficult to argue that pure statistical learning can cope with the\ncombinatorial explosion inherent in many commonsense reasoning tasks,\nespecially once arithmetical notions are involved. Further, we argue that\nbigger is not always better and chasing purely statistical improvements is\nflawed at the core, since it only exacerbates the dangerous conflation of the\nproduction of correct answers with genuine reasoning ability.",

However, the inherent randomness in their\nsampling mechanisms often result in inconsistent path quality and limited\nsearch efficiency. In response to these challenges, this work proposes a novel\ndeep learning-based motion planning framework, named Transformer-Enhanced\nMotion Planner (TEMP), which synergizes an Environmental Information Semantic\nEncoder (EISE) with a Motion Planning Transformer (MPT). EISE converts\nenvironmental data into semantic environmental information (SEI), providing MPT\nwith an enriched environmental comprehension. MPT leverages an attention\nmechanism to dynamically recalibrate its focus on SEI, task objectives, and\nhistorical planning data, refining the sampling node generation. To demonstrate\nthe capabilities of TEMP, we train our model using a dataset comprised of\nplanning results produced by the RRT*. EISE and MPT are collaboratively\ntrained, enabling EISE to autonomously learn and extract patterns from\nenvironmental data, thereby forming semantic representations that MPT could\nmore effectively interpret and utilize for motion planning. Subsequently, we\nconducted a systematic evaluation of TEMP's efficacy across diverse task\ndimensions, which demonstrates that TEMP achieves exceptional performance\nmetrics and a heightened degree of generalizability compared to\nstate-of-the-art SBMPs.",

    "abstract": "Recent self-training techniques have shown notable improvements in\nunsupervised domain adaptation for 3D object detection (3D UDA). These\ntechniques typically select pseudo labels, i.e., 3D boxes, to supervise models\nfor the target domain. However, this selection process inevitably introduces\nunreliable 3D boxes, in which 3D points cannot be definitively assigned as\nforeground or background. Previous techniques mitigate this by reweighting\nthese boxes as pseudo labels, but these boxes can still poison the training\nprocess. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel pseudo\nlabel refinery framework. Specifically, in the selection process, to improve\nthe reliability of pseudo boxes, we propose a complementary augmentation\nstrategy. This strategy involves either removing all points within an\nunreliable box or replacing it with a high-confidence box. Moreover, the point\nnumbers of instances in high-beam datasets are considerably higher than those\nin low-beam datasets, also degrading the quality of pseudo labels during the\ntraining process. We alleviate this issue by generating additional proposals\nand aligning RoI features across different domains. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method effectively enhances the quality of pseudo labels\nand consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on six autonomous\ndriving benchmarks.

Previous methods\ncommonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or\nsimultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated\nerror, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future\nsteps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these\nissues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local\ngeneration approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a\nseries of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range.\nSubsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are\nrecursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from\npropagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical\nfeasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but\nalso strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally,\nto ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable\ngranularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj\nsignificantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors\nacross the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its\neffectiveness.

    "abstract": "Medicine and deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) engineering\nrepresent two distinct fields each with decades of published history. With such\nhistory comes a set of terminology that has a specific way in which it is\napplied. However, when two distinct fields with overlapping terminology start\nto collaborate, miscommunication and misunderstandings can occur. This\nnarrative review aims to give historical context for these terms, accentuate\nthe importance of clarity when these terms are used in medical AI contexts, and\noffer solutions to mitigate misunderstandings by readers from either field.\nThrough an examination of historical documents, including articles, writing\nguidelines, and textbooks, this review traces the divergent evolution of terms\nfor data sets and their impact. Initially, the discordant interpretations of\nthe word 'validation' in medical and AI contexts are explored. Then the data\nsets used for AI evaluation are classified, namely random splitting,\ncross-validation, temporal, geographic, internal, and external sets. The\naccurate and standardized description of these data sets is crucial for\ndemonstrating the robustness and generalizability of AI applications in\nmedicine. This review clarifies existing literature to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of these classifications and their implications in AI evaluation.\nThis review then identifies often misunderstood terms and proposes pragmatic\nsolutions to mitigate terminological confusion. Among these solutions are the\nuse of standardized terminology such as 'training set,' 'validation (or tuning)\nset,' and 'test set,' and explicit definition of data set splitting\nterminologies in each medical AI research publication. This review aspires to\nenhance the precision of communication in medical AI, thereby fostering more\neffective and transparent research methodologies in this interdisciplinary\nfield.",

    "abstract": "In the current digital era, the rapid spread of misinformation on online\nplatforms presents significant challenges to societal well-being, public trust,\nand democratic processes, influencing critical decision making and public\nopinion. To address these challenges, there is a growing need for automated\nfake news detection mechanisms. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated exceptional capabilities across various natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks, prompting exploration into their potential for\nverifying news claims. Instead of employing LLMs in a non-agentic way, where\nLLMs generate responses based on direct prompts in a single shot, our work\nintroduces FactAgent, an agentic approach of utilizing LLMs for fake news\ndetection. FactAgent enables LLMs to emulate human expert behavior in verifying\nnews claims without any model training, following a structured workflow. This\nworkflow breaks down the complex task of news veracity checking into multiple\nsub-steps, where LLMs complete simple tasks using their internal knowledge or\nexternal tools. At the final step of the workflow, LLMs integrate all findings\nthroughout the workflow to determine the news claim's veracity. Compared to\nmanual human verification, FactAgent offers enhanced efficiency. Experimental\nstudies demonstrate the effectiveness of FactAgent in verifying claims without\nthe need for any training process. Moreover, FactAgent provides transparent\nexplanations at each step of the workflow and during final decision-making,\noffering insights into the reasoning process of fake news detection for end\nusers. FactAgent is highly adaptable, allowing for straightforward updates to\nits tools that LLMs can leverage within the workflow, as well as updates to the\nworkflow itself using domain knowledge. This adaptability enables FactAgent's\napplication to news verification across various domains.",

    "abstract": "The idea of using deep-learning-based molecular generation to accelerate\ndiscovery of drug candidates has attracted extraordinary attention, and many\ndeep generative models have been developed for automated drug design, termed\nmolecular generation. In general, molecular generation encompasses two main\nstrategies: de novo design, which generates novel molecular structures from\nscratch, and lead optimization, which refines existing molecules into drug\ncandidates. Among them, lead optimization plays an important role in real-world\ndrug design. For example, it can enable the development of me-better drugs that\nare chemically distinct yet more effective than the original drugs. It can also\nfacilitate fragment-based drug design, transforming virtual-screened small\nligands with low affinity into first-in-class medicines. Despite its\nimportance, automated lead optimization remains underexplored compared to the\nwell-established de novo generative models, due to its reliance on complex\nbiological and chemical knowledge. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nreview of traditional computational methods for lead optimization, organizing\nthese strategies into four principal sub-tasks with defined inputs and outputs.\nThis review delves into the basic concepts, goals, conventional CADD\ntechniques, and recent advancements in AIDD. Additionally, we introduce a\nunified perspective based on constrained subgraph generation to harmonize the\nmethodologies of de novo design and lead optimization. Through this lens, de\nnovo design can incorporate strategies from lead optimization to address the\nchallenge of generating hard-to-synthesize molecules; inversely, lead\noptimization can benefit from the innovations in de novo design by approaching\nit as a task of generating molecules conditioned on certain substructures.",

It is\nimportant to note that existing datasets have not incorporated images or QA\npairs, which are two crucial components of TableVQA. As such, the primary\nobjective of this paper is to obtain these necessary components. Specifically,\nimages are sourced either through the application of a \\textit{stylesheet} or\nby employing the proposed table rendering system. QA pairs are generated by\nexploiting the large language model (LLM) where the input is a text-formatted\ntable. Ultimately, the completed TableVQA-Bench comprises 1,500 QA pairs. We\ncomprehensively compare the performance of various multi-modal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) on TableVQA-Bench. GPT-4V achieves the highest accuracy among\ncommercial and open-sourced MLLMs from our experiments. Moreover, we discover\nthat the number of vision queries plays a significant role in TableVQA\nperformance. To further analyze the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to\ntheir LLM backbones, we investigate by presenting image-formatted tables to\nMLLMs and text-formatted tables to LLMs, respectively. Our findings suggest\nthat processing visual inputs is more challenging than text inputs, as\nevidenced by the lower performance of MLLMs, despite generally requiring higher\ncomputational costs than LLMs. The proposed TableVQA-Bench and evaluation codes\nare available at\n\\href{https://github.com/naver-ai/tablevqabench}{https://github.com/naver-ai/tablevqabench}.",

    "abstract": "We propose NeRF-Insert, a NeRF editing framework that allows users to make\nhigh-quality local edits with a flexible level of control. Unlike previous work\nthat relied on image-to-image models, we cast scene editing as an in-painting\nproblem, which encourages the global structure of the scene to be preserved.\nMoreover, while most existing methods use only textual prompts to condition\nedits, our framework accepts a combination of inputs of different modalities as\nreference. More precisely, a user may provide a combination of textual and\nvisual inputs including images, CAD models, and binary image masks for\nspecifying a 3D region. We use generic image generation models to in-paint the\nscene from multiple viewpoints, and lift the local edits to a 3D-consistent\nNeRF edit. Compared to previous methods, our results show better visual quality\nand also maintain stronger consistency with the original NeRF.",

    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an essential steppingstone in the field of\nnatural language processing. Although promising performance has been achieved\nby various distantly supervised models, we argue that distant supervision\ninevitably introduces incomplete and noisy annotations, which may mislead the\nmodel training process. To address this issue, we propose a robust NER model\nnamed BOND-MoE based on Mixture of Experts (MoE). Instead of relying on a\nsingle model for NER prediction, multiple models are trained and ensembled\nunder the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, so that noisy supervision\ncan be dramatically alleviated. In addition, we introduce a fair assignment\nmodule to balance the document-model assignment process. Extensive experiments\non real-world datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance compared with other distantly supervised NER.",

    "abstract": "There are a thousand ways to caption an image. Contrastive Language\nPretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption\nto a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the\ndiverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent\nLanguage Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could\nmatch an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are\nmixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from\nthe text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP\nand SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves\nzero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification\nbenchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot\ntop-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by\n1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by\n6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the\nmethod and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations.",

    "abstract": "With the rising prevalence of deepfakes, there is a growing interest in\ndeveloping generalizable detection methods for various types of deepfakes.\nWhile effective in their specific modalities, traditional detection methods\nfall short in addressing the generalizability of detection across diverse\ncross-modal deepfakes. This paper aims to explicitly learn potential\ncross-modal correlation to enhance deepfake detection towards various\ngeneration scenarios. Our approach introduces a correlation distillation task,\nwhich models the inherent cross-modal correlation based on content information.\nThis strategy helps to prevent the model from overfitting merely to\naudio-visual synchronization. Additionally, we present the Cross-Modal Deepfake\nDataset (CMDFD), a comprehensive dataset with four generation methods to\nevaluate the detection of diverse cross-modal deepfakes. The experimental\nresults on CMDFD and FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the superior\ngeneralizability of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods.

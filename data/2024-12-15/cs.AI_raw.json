    "abstract": "This study examines the effectiveness of traditional machine learning\nclassifiers versus deep learning models for detecting the imagined speech using\nelectroencephalogram data. Specifically, we evaluated conventional machine\nlearning techniques such as CSP-SVM and LDA-SVM classifiers alongside deep\nlearning architectures such as EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet. Machine\nlearning classifiers exhibited significantly lower precision and recall,\nindicating limited feature extraction capabilities and poor generalization\nbetween imagined speech and idle states. In contrast, deep learning models,\nparticularly EEGNet, achieved the highest accuracy of 0.7080 and an F1 score of\n0.6718, demonstrating their enhanced ability in automatic feature extraction\nand representation learning, essential for capturing complex neurophysiological\npatterns. These findings highlight the limitations of conventional machine\nlearning approaches in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and advocate\nfor adopting deep learning methodologies to achieve more precise and reliable\nclassification of detecting imagined speech. This foundational research\ncontributes to the development of imagined speech-based BCI systems.",

This paper proposes a\nmodular approach, where each step of the manipulation process is addressed with\ndedicated policies based on effective modality input, rather than relying on a\nsingle end-to-end model. To demonstrate this, a dexterous robotic hand performs\na manipulation task involving picking up and rotating a box. Guided by insights\nfrom neuroscience, the task is decomposed into three sub-skills, 1)reaching,\n2)grasping and lifting, and 3)in-hand rotation, based on the dominant sensory\nmodalities employed in the human brain. Each sub-skill is addressed using\ndistinct methods from a practical perspective: a classical controller, a\nVision-Language-Action model, and a reinforcement learning policy with force\nfeedback, respectively. We tested the pipeline on a real robot to demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our approach.

Alternatively, a\nlower-fidelity biosignal such as accelerometry has a significantly smaller\npower footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. While\naccelerometry is widely used for activity recognition and fitness, it is less\nexplored for health biomarkers and diagnosis.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Comprehensive AI-assisted Translation Edit Ratio\n(CATER), a novel and fully prompt-driven framework for evaluating machine\ntranslation (MT) quality. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) via a\ncarefully designed prompt-based protocol, CATER expands beyond traditional\nreference-bound metrics, offering a multidimensional, reference-independent\nevaluation that addresses linguistic accuracy, semantic fidelity, contextual\ncoherence, stylistic appropriateness, and information completeness. CATER's\nunique advantage lies in its immediate implementability: by providing the\nsource and target texts along with a standardized prompt, an LLM can rapidly\nidentify errors, quantify edit effort, and produce category-level and overall\nscores. This approach eliminates the need for pre-computed references or\ndomain-specific resources, enabling instant adaptation to diverse languages,\ngenres, and user priorities through adjustable weights and prompt\nmodifications. CATER's LLM-enabled strategy supports more nuanced assessments,\ncapturing phenomena such as subtle omissions, hallucinations, and\ndiscourse-level shifts that increasingly challenge contemporary MT systems. By\nuniting the conceptual rigor of frameworks like MQM and DQF with the\nscalability and flexibility of LLM-based evaluation, CATER emerges as a\nvaluable tool for researchers, developers, and professional translators\nworldwide. The framework and example prompts are openly available, encouraging\ncommunity-driven refinement and further empirical validation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data\nredundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational\nefficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial\nredundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in\neach video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size\nand location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we\nformulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and\nintroduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In\nspecific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full\nvideo sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to\nidentify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are\ninferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The full\nmodel can be trained in end-to-end conveniently. Furthermore, AdaFocus can be\nextended by further considering temporal and sample-wise redundancies, i.e.,\nallocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant frames, and\nminimizing the computation spent on relatively \"easier\" videos. Our resulting\napproach, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly\nintegrates spatial, temporal, and sample-wise dynamic computation, while it\npreserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and\nhardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it\nis compatible with off-the-shelf efficient backbones (e.g., TSM and X3D), which\ncan be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly\nimproved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on\nseven benchmark datasets and three application scenarios substantiate that\nUni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.",

Among them, the supervised methods demonstrate\nbetter performance by utilizing labels as supervisory signals compared with\nunsupervised methods. Currently, for almost all supervised multi-modal hashing\nmethods, there is a hidden assumption that training sets have no noisy labels.\nHowever, labels are often annotated incorrectly due to manual labeling in\nreal-world scenarios, which will greatly harm the retrieval performance. To\naddress this issue, we first discover a significant distribution consistency\npattern through experiments, i.e., the 1-0 distribution of the presence or\nabsence of each category in the label is consistent with the high-low\ndistribution of similarity scores of the hash codes relative to category\ncenters. Then, inspired by this pattern, we propose a novel\nDistribution-Consistency-Guided Multi-modal Hashing (DCGMH), which aims to\nfilter and reconstruct noisy labels to enhance retrieval performance.\nSpecifically, the proposed method first randomly initializes several category\ncenters, which are used to compute the high-low distribution of similarity\nscores; Noisy and clean labels are then separately filtered out via the\ndiscovered distribution consistency pattern to mitigate the impact of noisy\nlabels; Subsequently, a correction strategy, which is indirectly designed via\nthe distribution consistency pattern, is applied to the filtered noisy labels,\ncorrecting high-confidence ones while treating low-confidence ones as unlabeled\nfor unsupervised learning, thereby further enhancing the model's performance.\nExtensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines in multi-modal\nretrieval tasks.

We propose a chatbot\ngeneration engine based on the Rasa framework and a robust methodology for\nprojecting annotations onto the Wolof language using an in-house machine\ntranslation system. After evaluating a generated chatbot trained on the Amazon\nMassive dataset, our Wolof Intent Classifier performs similarly to the one\nobtained for French, which is a resource-rich language. We also show that this\napproach is extensible to other low-resource languages, thanks to the intent\nclassifier's language-agnostic pipeline, simplifying the design of chatbots in\nthese languages.",

To answer these questions, we conduct a\nsystematization over 79 AVD articles and 17 empirical studies, analyzing them\nacross five core components: task formulation and granularity, input\nprogramming languages and representations, detection approaches and key\nsolutions, evaluation metrics and datasets, and reported performance.\n  Our systematization reveals that the narrow focus of AVD research-mainly on\nspecific tasks and programming languages-limits its practical impact and\noverlooks broader areas crucial for effective, real-world vulnerability\ndetection.

Second, passive communication means that merchants can only\ninteract with players in a scripted manner. To tackle these issues and create\nan active merchant NPC, we propose a merchant framework based on large language\nmodels (LLMs), called MART, which consists of an appraiser module and a\nnegotiator module.

    "abstract": "The aim of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is to infer an agent's\npreferences from observing their behaviour. Usually, preferences are modelled\nas a reward function, $R$, and behaviour is modelled as a policy, $\\pi$. One of\nthe central difficulties in IRL is that multiple preferences may lead to the\nsame observed behaviour. That is, $R$ is typically underdetermined by $\\pi$,\nwhich means that $R$ is only partially identifiable. Recent work has\ncharacterised the extent of this partial identifiability for different types of\nagents, including optimal and Boltzmann-rational agents. However, work so far\nhas only considered agents that discount future reward exponentially: this is a\nserious limitation, especially given that extensive work in the behavioural\nsciences suggests that humans are better modelled as discounting\nhyperbolically. In this work, we newly characterise partial identifiability in\nIRL for agents with non-exponential discounting: our results are in particular\nrelevant for hyperbolical discounting, but they also more generally apply to\nagents that use other types of (non-exponential) discounting. We significantly\nshow that generally IRL is unable to infer enough information about $R$ to\nidentify the correct optimal policy, which entails that IRL alone can be\ninsufficient to adequately characterise the preferences of such agents.",

When dealing with high-dimensional and complex\ndatasets, existing symbolic regression models are often inefficient and tend to\ngenerate overly complex equations, making subsequent mechanism analysis\ncomplicated.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) often encounters delayed and sparse feedback in\nreal-world applications, even with only episodic rewards. Previous approaches\nhave made some progress in reward redistribution for credit assignment but\nstill face challenges, including training difficulties due to redundancy and\nambiguous attributions stemming from overlooking the multifaceted nature of\nmission performance evaluation. Hopefully, Large Language Model (LLM)\nencompasses fruitful decision-making knowledge and provides a plausible tool\nfor reward redistribution. Even so, deploying LLM in this case is non-trivial\ndue to the misalignment between linguistic knowledge and the symbolic form\nrequirement, together with inherent randomness and hallucinations in inference.\nTo tackle these issues, we introduce LaRe, a novel LLM-empowered symbolic-based\ndecision-making framework, to improve credit assignment. Key to LaRe is the\nconcept of the Latent Reward, which works as a multi-dimensional performance\nevaluation, enabling more interpretable goal attainment from various\nperspectives and facilitating more effective reward redistribution. We examine\nthat semantically generated code from LLM can bridge linguistic knowledge and\nsymbolic latent rewards, as it is executable for symbolic objects. Meanwhile,\nwe design latent reward self-verification to increase the stability and\nreliability of LLM inference. Theoretically, reward-irrelevant redundancy\nelimination in the latent reward benefits RL performance from more accurate\nreward estimation. Extensive experimental results witness that LaRe (i)\nachieves superior temporal credit assignment to SOTA methods, (ii) excels in\nallocating contributions among multiple agents, and (iii) outperforms policies\ntrained with ground truth rewards for certain tasks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the impact of adversarial attacks on the\nexplainability of deep learning models, which are commonly criticized for their\nblack-box nature despite their capacity for autonomous feature extraction. This\nblack-box nature can affect the perceived trustworthiness of these models. To\naddress this, explainability techniques such as GradCAM, SmoothGrad, and LIME\nhave been developed to clarify model decision-making processes. Our research\nfocuses on the robustness of these explanations when models are subjected to\nadversarial attacks, specifically those involving subtle image perturbations\nthat are imperceptible to humans but can significantly mislead models. For\nthis, we utilize attack methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and\nthe Basic Iterative Method (BIM) and observe their effects on model accuracy\nand explanations. The results reveal a substantial decline in model accuracy,\nwith accuracies dropping from 89.94% to 58.73% and 45.50% under FGSM and BIM\nattacks, respectively. Despite these declines in accuracy, the explanation of\nthe models measured by metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Root\nMean Square Error (RMSE) shows negligible changes, suggesting that these\nmetrics may not be sensitive enough to detect the presence of adversarial\nperturbations.",

Due to the existence of big data and consequently large\ncorpora for widely used languages like English, Spanish, Turkish, Persian, and\nmany more, these applications have been developed accurately. However, the\nKurdish language still requires more corpora and large datasets to be included\nin NLP applications.

While several studies have been\nconducted in KNLP for various applications, Kurdish NER (KNER) remains a\nchallenge for many KNLP tasks, including text analysis and classification. In\nthis work, we address this limitation by proposing a methodology for\nfine-tuning the pre-trained RoBERTa model for KNER. To this end, we first\ncreate a Kurdish corpus, followed by designing a modified model architecture\nand implementing the training procedures. To evaluate the trained model, a set\nof experiments is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the KNER model\nusing different tokenization methods and trained models. The experimental\nresults show that fine-tuned RoBERTa with the SentencePiece tokenization method\nsubstantially improves KNER performance, achieving a 12.8% improvement in\nF1-score compared to traditional models, and consequently establishes a new\nbenchmark for KNLP.",

    "abstract": "Real-world graphs have inherently complex and diverse topological patterns,\nknown as topological heterogeneity. Most existing works learn graph\nrepresentation in a single constant curvature space that is insufficient to\nmatch the complex geometric shapes, resulting in low-quality embeddings with\nhigh distortion. This also constitutes a critical challenge for graph\nfoundation models, which are expected to uniformly handle a wide variety of\ndiverse graph data. Recent studies have indicated that product manifold gains\nthe possibility to address topological heterogeneity. However, the product\nmanifold is still homogeneous, which is inadequate and inflexible for\nrepresenting the mixed heterogeneous topology. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Graph Mixture of Riemannian Experts (GraphMoRE) framework to effectively\ntackle topological heterogeneity by personalized fine-grained topology geometry\npattern preservation. Specifically, to minimize the embedding distortion, we\npropose a topology-aware gating mechanism to select the optimal embedding space\nfor each node. By fusing the outputs of diverse Riemannian experts with learned\ngating weights, we construct personalized mixed curvature spaces for nodes,\neffectively embedding the graph into a heterogeneous manifold with varying\ncurvatures at different points. Furthermore, to fairly measure pairwise\ndistances between different embedding spaces, we present a concise and\neffective alignment strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with lower\ndistortion, highlighting its potential for modeling complex graphs with\ntopological heterogeneity, and providing a novel architectural perspective for\ngraph foundation models.",

Most evaluation methods are computed based on offline\nmetrics for quick algorithm evolution, since online experiments are usually\nrisky and time-consuming. However, offline evaluation usually cannot fully\nreflect users' preference for the outcome of different recommendation\nalgorithms, and the results may not be consistent with online A/B test.\nMoreover, many offline metrics such as AUC do not offer sufficient information\nfor comparing the subtle differences between two competitive recommender\nsystems in different aspects, which may lead to substantial performance\ndifferences in long-term online serving. Fortunately, due to the strong\ncommonsense knowledge and role-play capability of large language models (LLMs),\nit is possible to obtain simulated user feedback on offline recommendation\nresults. Motivated by the idea of LLM Chatbot Arena, in this paper we present\nthe idea of RecSys Arena, where the recommendation results given by two\ndifferent recommender systems in each session are evaluated by an LLM judger to\nobtain fine-grained evaluation feedback. More specifically, for each sample we\nuse LLM to generate a user profile description based on user behavior history\nor off-the-shelf profile features, which is used to guide LLM to play the role\nof this user and evaluate the relative preference for two recommendation\nresults generated by different models. Through extensive experiments on two\nrecommendation datasets in different scenarios, we demonstrate that many\ndifferent LLMs not only provide general evaluation results that are highly\nconsistent with canonical offline metrics, but also provide rich insight in\nmany subjective aspects.

By considering the\nunderlying manifold in the weight space, ChipAlign employs geodesic\ninterpolation to effectively fuse the weights of input LLMs, producing a merged\nmodel that inherits strong instruction alignment and chip expertise from the\nrespective instruction and chip LLMs. Our results demonstrate that ChipAlign\nsignificantly enhances instruction-following capabilities of existing chip\nLLMs, achieving up to a 26.6% improvement on the IFEval benchmark, while\nmaintaining comparable expertise in the chip domain. This improvement in\ninstruction alignment also translates to notable gains in instruction-involved\nQA tasks, delivering performance enhancements of 3.9% on the OpenROAD QA\nbenchmark and 8.25% on production-level chip QA benchmarks, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language\nmodels (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named\nLarge Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF).

The two branches are first pre-trained\nindividually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on\nthese predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely\nresult. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance\nthe prediction ability of the two branches.

    "abstract": "Phase-field modeling reformulates fracture problems as energy minimization\nproblems and enables a comprehensive characterization of the fracture process,\nincluding crack nucleation, propagation, merging, and branching, without\nrelying on ad-hoc assumptions. However, the numerical solution of phase-field\nfracture problems is characterized by a high computational cost. To address\nthis challenge, in this paper, we employ a deep neural operator (DeepONet)\nconsisting of a branch network and a trunk network to solve brittle fracture\nproblems. We explore three distinct approaches that vary in their trunk network\nconfigurations. In the first approach, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a\ntwo-step DeepONet, which results in a simplification of the learning task. In\nthe second approach, we employ a physics-informed DeepONet, whereby the\nmathematical expression of the energy is integrated into the trunk network's\nloss to enforce physical consistency. The integration of physics also results\nin a substantially smaller data size needed for training. In the third\napproach, we replace the neural network in the trunk with a Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetwork and train it without the physics loss. Using these methods, we model\ncrack nucleation in a one-dimensional homogeneous bar under prescribed end\ndisplacements, as well as crack propagation and branching in single\nedge-notched specimens with varying notch lengths subjected to tensile and\nshear loading. We show that the networks predict the solution fields\naccurately, and the error in the predicted fields is localized near the crack.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for\nmobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions.\nParsing these scenes into semantic triplets <Subject-Predicate-Object> for\naccurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the\nfluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that\nleverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework\nintroduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video\nframes into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more\ncomprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a\nSpatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of\nChinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal\nTransport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level\ntoken sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To\nfurther improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we\napply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a\ntransformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict\nsemantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action\nGenome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of\nSceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.",

    "abstract": "Literature reviews are an essential component of scientific research, but\nthey remain time-intensive and challenging to write, especially due to the\nrecent influx of research papers. This paper explores the zero-shot abilities\nof recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of\nliterature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two\ncomponents: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing\na literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective\nLLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step\nsearch strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the\nabstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying\nan external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking\nmechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized\nrecall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the\nLLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step\napproach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in\nthe plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based\nliterature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a\nprotocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set\ncontamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to\npromote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical\nresults suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature\nreviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and\nplanning.

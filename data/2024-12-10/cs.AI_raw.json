    "abstract": "Epistemic planning is the sub-field of AI planning that focuses on changing\nknowledge and belief. It is important in both multi-agent domains where agents\nneed to have knowledge/belief regarding the environment, but also the beliefs\nof other agents, including nested beliefs. When modeling knowledge in\nmulti-agent settings, many models face an exponential growth challenge in terms\nof nested depth. A contemporary method, known as Planning with Perspectives\n(PWP), addresses these challenges through the use of perspectives and set\noperations for knowledge. The JP model defines that an agent's belief is\njustified if and only if the agent has seen evidence that this belief was true\nin the past and has not seen evidence to suggest that this has changed. The\ncurrent paper extends the JP model to handle \\emph{group belief}, including\ndistributed belief and common belief. We call this the Group Justified\nPerspective (GJP) model. Using experimental problems crafted by adapting\nwell-known benchmarks to a group setting, we show the efficiency and\nexpressiveness of our GJP model at handling planning problems that cannot be\nhandled by other epistemic planning tools.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models often struggle with generalization when deploying on\nreal-world data, due to the common distributional shift to the training data.\nTest-time adaptation (TTA) is an emerging scheme used at inference time to\naddress this issue. In TTA, models are adapted online at the same time when\nmaking predictions to test data. Neighbor-based approaches have gained\nattention recently, where prototype embeddings provide location information to\nalleviate the feature shift between training and testing data. However, due to\ntheir inherit limitation of simplicity, they often struggle to learn useful\npatterns and encounter performance degradation. To confront this challenge, we\nstudy the TTA problem from a geometric point of view. We first reveal that the\nunderlying structure of neighbor-based methods aligns with the Voronoi Diagram,\na classical computational geometry model for space partitioning. Building on\nthis observation, we propose the Test-Time adjustment by Voronoi Diagram\nguidance (TTVD), a novel framework that leverages the benefits of this\ngeometric property. Specifically, we explore two key structures: 1)\nCluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD): This integrates the joint contribution\nof self-supervision and entropy-based methods to provide richer information. 2)\nPower Diagram (PD): A generalized version of the Voronoi Diagram that refines\npartitions by assigning weights to each Voronoi cell. Our experiments under\nrigid, peer-reviewed settings on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, and\nImageNet-R shows that TTVD achieves remarkable improvements compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experimental results also explore\nthe effects of batch size and class imbalance, which are two scenarios commonly\nencountered in real-world applications. These analyses further validate the\nrobustness and adaptability of our proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has emerged as a pivotal framework for representation\nlearning, underpinning advances in both unimodal and bimodal applications like\nSimCLR and CLIP. To address fundamental limitations like large batch size\ndependency and bimodality, methods such as SogCLR leverage stochastic\noptimization for the global contrastive objective. Inspired by SogCLR's\nefficiency and adaptability, we introduce AmCLR and xAmCLR objective functions\ntailored for bimodal vision-language models to further enhance the robustness\nof contrastive learning. AmCLR integrates diverse augmentations, including text\nparaphrasing and image transformations, to reinforce the alignment of\ncontrastive representations, keeping batch size limited to a few hundred\nsamples unlike CLIP which needs batch size of 32,768 to produce reasonable\nresults. xAmCLR further extends this paradigm by incorporating intra-modal\nalignments between original and augmented modalities for richer feature\nlearning. These advancements yield a more resilient and generalizable\ncontrastive learning process, aimed at overcoming bottlenecks in scaling and\naugmentative diversity. Since we have built our framework on the existing\nSogCLR, we are able to demonstrate improved representation quality with fewer\ncomputational resources, establishing a foundation for scalable and robust\nmulti-modal learning.",

Schelling, awarded the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic\nSciences, pointed out that ``individuals decisions (micromotives), while often\npersonal and localized, can lead to societal outcomes (macrobehavior) that are\nfar more complex and different from what the individuals intended.'' The\ncurrent research related to large language models' (LLMs') micromotives, such\nas preferences or biases, assumes that users will make more appropriate\ndecisions once LLMs are devoid of preferences or biases. Consequently, a series\nof studies has focused on removing bias from LLMs. In the NLP community, while\nthere are many discussions on LLMs' micromotives, previous studies have seldom\nconducted a systematic examination of how LLMs may influence society's\nmacrobehavior. In this paper, we follow the design of Schelling's model of\nsegregation to observe the relationship between the micromotives and\nmacrobehavior of LLMs. Our results indicate that, regardless of the level of\nbias in LLMs, a highly segregated society will emerge as more people follow\nLLMs' suggestions. We hope our discussion will spark further consideration of\nthe fundamental assumption regarding the mitigation of LLMs' micromotives and\nencourage a reevaluation of how LLMs may influence users and society.",

A\nvariety of new linguistic behaviours present themselves embodied as computers,\nenhanced humans, and collectives with various kinds of integration and\ncommunication. But to measure and understand the behaviours generated by such\nsystems, we must clarify the language we use to talk about them. Computational\nmodels are often confused with the phenomena they try to model and shallow\nmetaphors are used as justifications for (or to hype) the success of\ncomputational techniques on many tasks related to natural language; thus\nimplying their progress toward human-level machine intelligence without ever\nclarifying what that means.\n  This paper discusses the challenges in the specification of \"machines of\nmeaning\", machines capable of acquiring meaningful semantics from natural\nlanguage in order to achieve their goals. We characterize \"meaning\" in a\ncomputational setting, while highlighting the need for detachment from\nanthropocentrism in the study of the behaviour of machines of meaning. The\npressing need to analyse AI risks and ethics requires a proper measurement of\nits capabilities which cannot be productively studied and explained while using\nambiguous language.

    "abstract": "Epistemic Planning (EP) is an important research area dedicated to reasoning\nabout the knowledge and beliefs of agents in multi-agent cooperative or\nadversarial settings. The Justified Perspective (JP) model is the\nstate-of-the-art approach to solving EP problems with efficiency and\nexpressiveness. However, all existing EP methods inherit the static environment\nassumption from classical planning. This limitation hinders the application of\nEP in fields such as robotics with multi-agent settings, where the environment\ncontains changing variables.\n  In this paper, we propose an extension of the JP model, namely, the\nPredictive Justified Perspective (PJP) model, to remove this assumption.\nInstead of assuming that beliefs remain unchanged since the last observation,\nthe PJP model uses all past observations to form predictions about the changing\nvariables. The definition of the prediction function with examples is provided,\nand it is demonstrated that it can work with arbitrary nesting. We then\nimplemented the PJP model in several well-known domains and compared it with\nthe JP model in the experiments. The results indicated that the PJP model\nperforms exceptionally well across various domains, demonstrating its potential\nin improving EP applications in robotics.",

Second, it mitigates hallucinations and misuse by integrating a\nknowledge graph ontology to validate the final answer.

However, conventional MDC video codecs suffer\nfrom cumbersome architectures, poor scalability, limited loss resilience, and\nlower compression efficiency. As a result, MDC has never been widely adopted.\nInspired by the potential of neural video codecs, this paper rethinks MDC\ndesign. We propose a novel MDC video codec, NeuralMDC, demonstrating how\nbidirectional transformers trained for masked token prediction can vastly\nsimplify the design of MDC video codec. To compress a video, NeuralMDC starts\nby tokenizing each frame into its latent representation and then splits the\nlatent tokens to create multiple descriptions containing correlated\ninformation. Instead of using motion prediction and warping operations,\nNeuralMDC trains a bidirectional masked transformer to model the\nspatial-temporal dependencies of latent representations and predict the\ndistribution of the current representation based on the past. The predicted\ndistribution is used to independently entropy code each description and infer\nany potentially lost tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate NeuralMDC\nachieves state-of-the-art loss resilience with minimal sacrifices in\ncompression efficiency, significantly outperforming the best existing\nresidual-coding-based error-resilient neural video codec.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning has recently gained significant popularity, demonstrating\nimpressive performance across various zero-shot classification tasks and a\nrange of perceptive and generative applications.

Despite their success, the working mechanisms underlying\nmultimodal learning are not yet well understood. Notably, these models often\nexhibit a modality gap, where different modalities occupy distinct regions\nwithin the shared representation space. In this work, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of the emergence of modality gap by characterizing the gradient flow\nlearning dynamics. Specifically, we identify the critical roles of mismatched\ndata pairs and a learnable temperature parameter in causing and perpetuating\nthe modality gap during training. Furthermore, our theoretical insights are\nvalidated through experiments on practical CLIP models.

We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,\na popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find\nthat, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing\nintimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously\npossible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI\ncompanion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer\nwelfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,\nand devaluing the \"new\" AI relative to the \"original\". Experimental evidence\nconfirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel\ncloser to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a\nloss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate\nproducts. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI\ncompanions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of\nmourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and\ndevaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity.

For each\ntask, it is essential that the policy model is interpretable. Learning accurate\nmodels requires effectively capturing the state of a patient, either through\nsequence representation learning or carefully crafted summaries of their\nmedical history. While recent work has favored the former, it remains a\nquestion as to how histories should best be represented for interpretable\npolicy modeling. Focused on model fit, we systematically compare diverse\napproaches to summarizing patient history for interpretable modeling of\nclinical policies across four sequential decision-making tasks. We illustrate\ndifferences in the policies learned using various representations by breaking\ndown evaluations by patient subgroups, critical states, and stages of\ntreatment, highlighting challenges specific to common use cases. We find that\ninterpretable sequence models using learned representations perform on par with\nblack-box models across all tasks. Interpretable models using hand-crafted\nrepresentations perform substantially worse when ignoring history entirely, but\nare made competitive by incorporating only a few aggregated and recent elements\nof patient history. The added benefits of using a richer representation are\npronounced for subgroups and in specific use cases. This underscores the\nimportance of evaluating policy models in the context of their intended use.",

To address this, we employ feedforward neural\nnetworks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU\ninference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal\naccuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\\infty $ errors of $\n4.54 \\times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \\times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the\nNNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with\nmixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to\ntraditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT\nengine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than\na traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of\n1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the\nDelta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA\nA100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for\nTensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8\nmillion data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with\nincreasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed,\nenabling further validation and extension of our findings. This work\nunderscores the potential of ML, combined with GPU optimization and model\nquantization, to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic\nhydrodynamics simulations.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning about motion and space is a fundamental cognitive capability that\nis required by multiple real-world applications. While many studies highlight\nthat large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space,\nthey only focus on static spatial relationships, and not dynamic awareness of\nmotion and space, i.e., reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object\nmotions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera\nmovements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude\ntraining dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across\n175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also\nconstruct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set\nusing real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static\nspatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and\ndynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly\neffective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images.\nWe show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing\napproaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training\nimproves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an\naverage 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic\ntest set and spatial reasoning on long videos -- even outperforming some large\nproprietary models. While reasoning over static relationships improves with\nsynthetic training data, there is still considerable room for improvement for\ndynamic reasoning questions.",

Despite significant progress in the area, most existing methods\nconcentrate on audio-lip synchronization, often overlooking aspects such as\nvisual quality, customization, and generalization that are crucial to producing\nrealistic talking faces. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel,\ncustomizable one-shot audio-driven talking face generation framework, named\nPortraitTalk. Our proposed method utilizes a latent diffusion framework\nconsisting of two main components: IdentityNet and AnimateNet. IdentityNet is\ndesigned to preserve identity features consistently across the generated video\nframes, while AnimateNet aims to enhance temporal coherence and motion\nconsistency. This framework also integrates an audio input with the reference\nimages, thereby reducing the reliance on reference-style videos prevalent in\nexisting approaches. A key innovation of PortraitTalk is the incorporation of\ntext prompts through decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, which significantly\nexpands creative control over the generated videos. Through extensive\nexperiments, including a newly developed evaluation metric, our model\ndemonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, setting a\nnew standard for the generation of customizable realistic talking faces\nsuitable for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network\narchitectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they\nspecifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for\ntime-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs,\nas well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of\nstrictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong\nlimitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our\nhardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the\nregister level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a\nparallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in\nparallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable\nflexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization\nframework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It\nmodels the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including\nthe notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our\nConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer\nCSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla\nPyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton\nimplementation.

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has changed the game for real-time photo-realistic\nrendering. One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to\ncreate animatable avatars, known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed\nthe boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main\nlimitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars\nwith free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only\nrendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be\ntrained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as\na webcam, and rendered from any view. To this end, we propose GASP: Gaussian\nAvatars with Synthetic Priors. To overcome the limitations of existing\ndatasets, we exploit the pixel-perfect nature of synthetic data to train a\nGaussian Avatar prior. By fitting this prior model to a single photo or video\nand fine-tuning it, we get a high-quality Gaussian Avatar, which supports\n360$^\\circ$ rendering. Our prior is only required for fitting, not inference,\nenabling real-time application. Through our method, we obtain high-quality,\nanimatable Avatars from limited data which can be animated and rendered at\n70fps on commercial hardware.

In real-world\napplications (i.e., non-simulated environments), sensors are essential for\nmeasuring the current state and providing the observations on which RL policies\nrely to make decisions. A significant challenge in deploying RL policies in\nreal-world scenarios is handling sensor dropouts, which can result from\nhardware malfunctions, physical damage, or environmental factors like dust on a\ncamera lens. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is the use of backup\nsensors, though this comes with added costs. This paper explores the\noptimization of backup sensor configurations to maximize expected returns while\nkeeping costs below a specified threshold, C. Our approach uses a second-order\napproximation of expected returns and includes penalties for exceeding cost\nconstraints. We then optimize this quadratic program using Tabu Search, a\nmeta-heuristic algorithm. The approach is evaluated across eight OpenAI Gym\nenvironments and a custom Unity-based robotic environment (RobotArmGrasping).\nEmpirical results demonstrate that our quadratic program effectively\napproximates real expected returns, facilitating the identification of optimal\nsensor configurations.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents\nby integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs\ndemonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits\nadaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by\nimplementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above\nan LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through\nprincipled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment\nusing three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven\nobservation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's\nlearning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of\nprompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of\nenvironment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices.\nAction selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation\nbehavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt\ntesting. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model\ncapabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable\nagents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control\nproblems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.",

In this work, we revisit the\nexisting offline MARL methods and show that in certain scenarios they can be\nproblematic, leading to uncoordinated behaviors and out-of-distribution (OOD)\njoint actions. To address these issues, we propose a new offline MARL\nalgorithm, named In-Sample Sequential Policy Optimization (InSPO). InSPO\nsequentially updates each agent's policy in an in-sample manner, which not only\navoids selecting OOD joint actions but also carefully considers teammates'\nupdated policies to enhance coordination. Additionally, by thoroughly exploring\nlow-probability actions in the behavior policy, InSPO can well address the\nissue of premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. Theoretically, we\nprove InSPO guarantees monotonic policy improvement and converges to quantal\nresponse equilibrium (QRE). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our method compared to current state-of-the-art offline MARL methods.",

The emergence of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) offers a promising new direction for HT detection by\nleveraging their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. For\nthe first time, this paper explores the potential of general-purpose LLMs in\ndetecting various HTs inserted in Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs,\nincluding SRAM, AES, and UART modules. We propose a novel tool for this goal\nthat systematically assesses state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 pro, and\nLlama 3.1) in detecting HTs without prior fine-tuning. To address potential\ntraining data bias, the tool implements perturbation techniques, i.e., variable\nname obfuscation, and design restructuring, that make the cases more\nsophisticated for the used LLMs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates\nperfect detection rates by GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 pro in baseline scenarios\n(100%/100% precision/recall), with both models achieving better trigger line\ncoverage (TLC: 0.82-0.98) than payload line coverage (PLC: 0.32-0.46).

    "abstract": "In sequential decision-making environments, the primary approaches for\ntraining agents are Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL).\nUnlike RL, which relies on modeling a reward function, IL leverages expert\ndemonstrations, where an expert policy $\\pi_e$ (e.g., a human) provides the\ndesired behavior. Formally, a dataset $D$ of state-action pairs is provided: $D\n= {(s, a = \\pi_e(s))}$. A common technique within IL is Behavior Cloning (BC),\nwhere a policy $\\pi(s) = a$ is learned through supervised learning on $D$.\nFurther improvements can be achieved by using an ensemble of $N$ individually\ntrained BC policies, denoted as $E = {\\pi_i(s)}{1 \\leq i \\leq N}$. The\nensemble's action $a$ for a given state $s$ is the aggregated output of the $N$\nactions: $a = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum{i} \\pi_i(s)$. This paper addresses the issue of\nincreasing action differences -- the observation that discrepancies between the\n$N$ predicted actions grow in states that are underrepresented in the training\ndata. Large action differences can result in suboptimal aggregated actions. To\naddress this, we propose a method that fosters greater alignment among the\npolicies while preserving the diversity of their computations. This approach\nreduces action differences and ensures that the ensemble retains its inherent\nstrengths, such as robustness and varied decision-making. We evaluate our\napproach across eight diverse environments, demonstrating a notable decrease in\naction differences and significant improvements in overall performance, as\nmeasured by mean episode returns.",

This scaling\nbehavior has brought a great deal of attention, as it provides valuable\nguidance in the design and training of even larger models.\n  Taking inspiration from the scaling laws observed in training large language\nmodels, we explore similar principles for sequential recommendation.\n  We use the full Amazon Product Data dataset, which has only been partially\nexplored in other studies, and reveal scaling behaviors similar to those found\nin language models. Compute-optimal training is possible but requires a careful\nanalysis of the compute-performance trade-offs specific to the application.\n  We also show that performance scaling translates to downstream tasks by\nfine-tuning larger pre-trained models on smaller task-specific domains.

    "abstract": "Current video retrieval systems, especially those used in competitions,\nprimarily focus on querying individual keyframes or images rather than encoding\nan entire clip or video segment. However, queries often describe an action or\nevent over a series of frames, not a specific image. This results in\ninsufficient information when analyzing a single frame, leading to less\naccurate query results. Moreover, extracting embeddings solely from images\n(keyframes) does not provide enough information for models to encode\nhigher-level, more abstract insights inferred from the video. These models tend\nto only describe the objects present in the frame, lacking a deeper\nunderstanding. In this work, we propose a system that integrates the latest\nmethodologies, introducing a novel pipeline that extracts multimodal data, and\nincorporate information from multiple frames within a video, enabling the model\nto abstract higher-level information that captures latent meanings, focusing on\nwhat can be inferred from the video clip, rather than just focusing on object\ndetection in one single image.",

As the most powerful models are proprietary\nand can only be invoked via an API, users often manually refine prompts in a\nblack-box setting by adjusting instructions and few-shot examples until they\nachieve good performance as measured on a validation set. Recent methods\naddressing static black-box prompt selection face significant limitations: They\noften fail to leverage the inherent structure of prompts, treating instructions\nand few-shot exemplars as a single block of text.

We introduce HbBoPs, a novel Hyperband-based Bayesian optimization\nmethod for black-box prompt selection addressing these key limitations.

The structural-aware\nmodeling approach utilizes separate embeddings for instructions and few-shot\nexemplars, enhancing the surrogate model's ability to capture prompt\nperformance and predict which prompt to evaluate next in a sample-efficient\nmanner. Together with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler we further enable\nquery-efficiency by adaptively allocating resources across different fidelity\nlevels, keeping the total number of validation instances prompts are evaluated\non low. Extensive evaluation across ten benchmarks and three LLMs demonstrate\nthat HbBoPs outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing work faces challenges in both\ntraining efficiency and generalization capabilities (i.e., Reinforcement\nLearning from Human Feedback and Red-Teaming). Developing effective strategies\nto enable LLMs to resist continuously evolving jailbreak attempts represents a\nsignificant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defensive\nparadigm called GuidelineLLM, which assists LLMs in recognizing queries that\nmay have harmful content.

To\novercome this challenge, we propose a novel optimization method for training\ndeep neural networks called structured natural gradient descent (SNGD).\nTheoretically, we demonstrate that optimizing the original network using NGD is\nequivalent to using fast gradient descent (GD) to optimize the reconstructed\nnetwork with a structural transformation of the parameter matrix. Thereby, we\ndecompose the calculation of the global Fisher information matrix into the\nefficient computation of local Fisher matrices via constructing local Fisher\nlayers in the reconstructed network to speed up the training. Experimental\nresults on various deep networks and datasets demonstrate that SNGD achieves\nfaster convergence speed than NGD while retaining comparable solutions.\nFurthermore, our method outperforms traditional GDs in terms of efficiency and\neffectiveness.

Due to their massive size and the high costs\nassociated with training, LLMs are not suitable for frequent retraining.\nHowever, updates are necessary to keep them in sync with rapidly evolving human\nknowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Compression\nMemory Training (CMT) method, an efficient and effective online adaptation\nframework for LLMs that features robust knowledge retention capabilities.\nInspired by human memory mechanisms, CMT compresses and extracts information\nfrom new documents to be stored in a memory bank.

The parameters of the LLM\nitself do not change during training and inference, reducing the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting.

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for diagnosing and planning\ntreatment in various medical conditions due to its ability to produce\nmulti-series images that reveal different tissue characteristics. However,\nintegrating these diverse series to form a coherent analysis presents\nsignificant challenges, such as differing spatial resolutions and contrast\npatterns meanwhile requiring extensive annotated data, which is scarce in\nclinical practice. Due to these issues, we introduce a novel Cross-Series\nMasking (CSM) Strategy for effectively learning MRI representation in a\nself-supervised manner. Specifically, CSM commences by randomly sampling a\nsubset of regions and series, which are then strategically masked. In the\ntraining process, the cross-series representation is learned by utilizing the\nunmasked data to reconstruct the masked portions. This process not only\nintegrates information across different series but also facilitates the ability\nto model both intra-series and inter-series correlations and complementarities.\nWith the learned representation, the downstream tasks like segmentation and\nclassification are also enhanced. Taking brain tissue segmentation, breast\ntumor benign/malignant classification, and prostate cancer diagnosis as\nexamples, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both public and\nin-house datasets.",

    "abstract": "Ensembles of generative large language models (LLMs) can integrate the\nstrengths of different LLMs to compensate for the limitations of individual\nmodels. However, recent work has focused on training an additional fusion model\nto combine complete responses from multiple LLMs, failing to tap into their\ncollaborative potential to generate higher-quality responses. Moreover, as the\nadditional fusion model is trained on a specialized dataset, these methods\nstruggle with generalizing to open-domain queries from online users. In this\npaper, we propose SpecFuse, a novel ensemble framework that outputs the fused\nresult by iteratively producing the next segment through collaboration among\nLLMs. This is achieved through cyclic execution of its inference and\nverification components. In each round, the inference component invokes each\nbase LLM to generate candidate segments in parallel, and the verify component\ncalls these LLMs again to predict the ranking of the segments. The top-ranked\nsegment is then broadcast to all LLMs, encouraging them to generate\nhigher-quality segments in the next round. This approach also allows the base\nLLMs to be plug-and-play, without any training or adaptation, avoiding\ngeneralization limitations. Furthermore, to conserve computational resources,\nwe propose a model exit mechanism that dynamically excludes models exhibiting\npoor performance in previous rounds during each query response. In this way, it\neffectively reduces the number of model calls while maintaining overall\nperformance.",

Recently, PGPIS methods that use diffusion models have\nachieved competitive performance. Most approaches involve extracting\nrepresentations of the target pose and source image and learning their\nrelationships in the generative model's training process. This approach makes\nit difficult to learn the semantic relationships between the input and target\nimages and complicates the model structure needed to enhance generation\nresults. To address these issues, we propose Fusion embedding for PGPIS using a\nDiffusion Model (FPDM). Inspired by the successful application of pre-trained\nCLIP models in text-to-image diffusion models, our method consists of two\nstages. The first stage involves training the fusion embedding of the source\nimage and target pose to align with the target image's embedding. In the second\nstage, the generative model uses this fusion embedding as a condition to\ngenerate the target image. We applied the proposed method to the benchmark\ndatasets DeepFashion and RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T, and conducted both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance.

In this work, we approach the oversmoothing problem\nfrom a dynamical systems perspective, providing a deeper understanding of the\nstability and convergence behavior of GNNs.

This approach utilizes noise-driven covariance\nanalysis and Anti-Hebbian principles to selectively prune redundant attention\nweights, dynamically adjusting the network's behavior to maintain node feature\ndiversity and stability. Our theoretical analysis reveals how DYNAMO-GAT\ndisrupts the convergence to oversmoothed states, while experimental results on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance and efficiency compared\nto traditional and state-of-the-art methods.

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited\nby specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and\ngeneralizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing\nbody of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still\nleave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full\nEEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between\nall EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal\ndependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of\nEEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited\ngeneralizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats\nof EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a\ncriss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural\ncharacteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal\ndependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we\nutilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode\npositional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with\ndiverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through\npatch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10\ndownstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong\ncapability and generalizability.

Additionally, the SFL model owner sets incentives to encourage\nclient participation in the SFL process. The optimization strategies employed\nby the SFL model owner influence clients' decisions regarding the amount of\ndata they contribute, taking into account the shared incentives over clients\nand anticipated energy consumption during SFL. To address this framework, we\nmodel the problem using a hierarchical decision-making approach, formulated as\na single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. We demonstrate the existence\nand uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium among clients and analyze the\nStackelberg equilibrium by examining the leader's game.

    "abstract": "Single image super-resolution (SR) has long posed a challenge in the field of\ncomputer vision. While the advent of deep learning has led to the emergence of\nnumerous methods aimed at tackling this persistent issue, the current\nmethodologies still encounter challenges in modeling long sequence information,\nleading to limitations in effectively capturing the global pixel interactions.\nTo tackle this challenge and achieve superior SR outcomes, we propose the Mamba\npixel-wise sequential interaction network (MPSI), aimed at enhancing the\nestablishment of long-range connections of information, particularly focusing\non pixel-wise sequential interaction. We propose the Channel-Mamba Block (CMB)\nto capture comprehensive pixel interaction information by effectively modeling\nlong sequence information. Moreover, in the existing SR methodologies, there\npersists the issue of the neglect of features extracted by preceding layers,\nleading to the loss of valuable feature information. While certain existing\nmodels strive to preserve these features, they frequently encounter difficulty\nin establishing connections across all layers. To overcome this limitation,\nMPSI introduces the Mamba channel recursion module (MCRM), which maximizes the\nretention of valuable feature information from early layers, thereby\nfacilitating the acquisition of pixel sequence interaction information from\nmultiple-level layers. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that\nMPSI outperforms existing super-resolution methods in terms of image\nreconstruction results, attaining state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Students are increasingly relying on Generative AI (GAI) to support their\nwriting-a key pedagogical practice in education. In GAI-assisted writing,\nstudents can delegate core cognitive tasks (e.g., generating ideas and turning\nthem into sentences) to GAI while still producing high-quality essays. This\ncreates new challenges for teachers in assessing and supporting student\nlearning, as they often lack insight into whether students are engaging in\nmeaningful cognitive processes during writing or how much of the essay's\nquality can be attributed to those processes. This study aimed to help teachers\nbetter assess and support student learning in GAI-assisted writing by examining\nhow different writing behaviors, especially those indicative of meaningful\nlearning versus those that are not, impact essay quality. Using a dataset of\n1,445 GAI-assisted writing sessions, we applied the cutting-edge method,\nX-Learner, to quantify the causal impact of three GAI-assisted writing\nbehavioral patterns (i.e., seeking suggestions but not accepting them, seeking\nsuggestions and accepting them as they are, and seeking suggestions and\naccepting them with modification) on four measures of essay quality (i.e.,\nlexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, text cohesion, and linguistic\nbias). Our analysis showed that writers who frequently modified GAI-generated\ntext-suggesting active engagement in higher-order cognitive\nprocesses-consistently improved the quality of their essays in terms of lexical\nsophistication, syntactic complexity, and text cohesion. In contrast, those who\noften accepted GAI-generated text without changes, primarily engaging in\nlower-order processes, saw a decrease in essay quality. Additionally, while\nhuman writers tend to introduce linguistic bias when writing independently,\nincorporating GAI-generated text-even without modification-can help mitigate\nthis bias.",

To tackle this\nissue, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as an FL framework with\nreduced workload on edge devices via model splitting; it has received extensive\nattention from the research community in recent years. Nevertheless, most prior\nworks on SFL focus only on a two-tier architecture without harnessing\nmulti-tier cloudedge computing resources. In this paper, we intend to analyze\nand optimize the learning performance of SFL under multi-tier systems.\nSpecifically, we propose the hierarchical SFL (HSFL) framework and derive its\nconvergence bound. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint\noptimization problem for model splitting (MS) and model aggregation (MA). To\nsolve this rather hard problem, we then decompose it into MS and MA subproblems\nthat can be solved via an iterative descending algorithm.

While their performance is often attributed to the\npowerful neighborhood aggregation mechanism, recent studies suggest that other\ncomponents such as non-linear layers may also significantly affecting how GNNs\nprocess the input graph data in the spectral domain. Such evidence challenges\nthe prevalent opinion that neighborhood aggregation mechanisms dominate the\nbehavioral characteristics of GNNs in the spectral domain. To demystify such a\nconflict, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark to measure and\nevaluate GNNs' capability in capturing and leveraging the information encoded\nin different frequency components of the input graph data.

While the current benchmarks in VAU predominantly\nemphasize the detection and localization of anomalies. Here, we endeavor to\ndelve deeper into the practical aspects of VAU by addressing the essential\nquestions: \"what anomaly occurred?\", \"why did it happen?\", and \"how severe is\nthis abnormal event?\". In pursuit of these answers, we introduce a\ncomprehensive benchmark for Exploring the Causation of Video Anomalies (ECVA).\nOur benchmark is meticulously designed, with each video accompanied by detailed\nhuman annotations. Specifically, each instance of our ECVA involves three sets\nof human annotations to indicate \"what\", \"why\" and \"how\" of an anomaly,\nincluding 1) anomaly type, start and end times, and event descriptions, 2)\nnatural language explanations for the cause of an anomaly, and 3) free text\nreflecting the effect of the abnormality. Building upon this foundation, we\npropose a novel prompt-based methodology that serves as a baseline for tackling\nthe intricate challenges posed by ECVA. We utilize \"hard prompt\" to guide the\nmodel to focus on the critical parts related to video anomaly segments, and\n\"soft prompt\" to establish temporal and spatial relationships within these\nanomaly segments. Furthermore, we propose AnomEval, a specialized evaluation\nmetric crafted to align closely with human judgment criteria for ECVA. This\nmetric leverages the unique features of the ECVA dataset to provide a more\ncomprehensive and reliable assessment of various video large language models.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through rigorous experimental\nanalysis and delineate possible avenues for further investigation into the\ncomprehension of video anomaly causation.",

    "abstract": "In modern chip design, placement aims at placing millions of circuit modules,\nwhich is an essential step that significantly influences power, performance,\nand area (PPA) metrics. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a\npromising technique for improving placement quality, especially macro\nplacement. However, current RL-based placement methods suffer from long\ntraining times, low generalization ability, and inability to guarantee PPA\nresults. A key issue lies in the problem formulation, i.e., using RL to place\nfrom scratch, which results in limits useful information and inaccurate rewards\nduring the training process. In this work, we propose an approach that utilizes\nRL for the refinement stage, which allows the RL policy to learn how to adjust\nexisting placement layouts, thereby receiving sufficient information for the\npolicy to act and obtain relatively dense and precise rewards. Additionally, we\nintroduce the concept of regularity during training, which is considered an\nimportant metric in the chip design industry but is often overlooked in current\nRL placement methods. We evaluate our approach on the ISPD 2005 and ICCAD 2015\nbenchmark, comparing the global half-perimeter wirelength and regularity of our\nproposed method against several competitive approaches. Besides, we test the\nPPA performance using commercial software, showing that RL as a regulator can\nachieve significant PPA improvements. Our RL regulator can fine-tune placements\nfrom any method and enhance their quality. Our work opens up new possibilities\nfor the application of RL in placement, providing a more effective and\nefficient approach to optimizing chip design.

This novel methodology is engineered to augment the\nefficacy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multiple-choice visual reasoning\ntasks. Diverging from conventional approaches that evaluate each option\nindependently, MM-PoE employs a dual-step scoring paradigm that initially\nidentifies and excludes implausible choices, subsequently concentrating on the\nmost probable remaining options. This method emulates human test-taking\nstrategies, where individuals typically eliminate clearly incorrect answers\nprior to selecting the optimal response. Our empirical evaluations, conducted\nacross three benchmark datasets, reveal that MM-PoE significantly improves both\nzero-shot and few-shot performance of contemporary state-of-the-art VLMs.\nCritically, this approach not only broadens the application of the elimination\nprocess to multi-modal contexts but also allows few-shot experiments, thereby\naddressing two principal limitations concerning usage of PoE only in zero-shot\nsettings and only with a language-only framework. As a result, MM-PoE not only\nrefines the reasoning capabilities of VLMs but also broadens their\napplicability to complex visual question-answering scenarios.

    "abstract": "Predicting roll call votes through modeling political actors has emerged as a\nfocus in quantitative political science and computer science. Widely used\nembedding-based methods generate vectors for legislators from diverse data sets\nto predict legislative behaviors. However, these methods often contend with\nchallenges such as the need for manually predefined features, reliance on\nextensive training data, and a lack of interpretability. Achieving more\ninterpretable predictions under flexible conditions remains an unresolved\nissue. This paper introduces the Political Actor Agent (PAA), a novel\nagent-based framework that utilizes Large Language Models to overcome these\nlimitations. By employing role-playing architectures and simulating legislative\nsystem, PAA provides a scalable and interpretable paradigm for predicting\nroll-call votes. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but\nalso offers multi-view, human-understandable decision reasoning, providing new\ninsights into political actor behaviors. We conducted comprehensive experiments\nusing voting records from the 117-118th U.S. House of Representatives,\nvalidating the superior performance and interpretability of PAA. This study not\nonly demonstrates PAA's effectiveness but also its potential in political\nscience research.",

While there is a growing consensus that intelligent network\nself-driving holds the key, it heavily relies on expert experience and\nknowledge extracted from network data. In an effort to facilitate convenient\nanalytics and utilization of wireless big data, we introduce the concept of\nknowledge graphs into the field of mobile networks, giving rise to what we term\nas wireless data knowledge graphs (WDKGs). However, the heterogeneous and\ndynamic nature of communication networks renders manual WDKG construction both\nprohibitively costly and error-prone, presenting a fundamental challenge. In\nthis context, we propose an unsupervised data-and-model driven graph structure\nlearning (DMGSL) framework, aimed at automating WDKG refinement and updating.\nTackling WDKG heterogeneity involves stratifying the network into homogeneous\nlayers and refining it at a finer granularity. Furthermore, to capture WDKG\ndynamics effectively, we segment the network into static snapshots based on the\ncoherence time and harness the power of recurrent neural networks to\nincorporate historical information.

    "abstract": "An effective approach for sampling from unnormalized densities is based on\nthe idea of gradually transporting samples from an easy prior to the\ncomplicated target distribution. Two popular methods are (1) Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC), where the transport is performed through successive annealed\ndensities via prescribed Markov chains and resampling steps, and (2) recently\ndeveloped diffusion-based sampling methods, where a learned dynamical transport\nis used. Despite the common goal, both approaches have different, often\ncomplementary, advantages and drawbacks. The resampling steps in SMC allow\nfocusing on promising regions of the space, often leading to robust\nperformance. While the algorithm enjoys asymptotic guarantees, the lack of\nflexible, learnable transitions can lead to slow convergence. On the other\nhand, diffusion-based samplers are learned and can potentially better adapt\nthemselves to the target at hand, yet often suffer from training instabilities.\nIn this work, we present a principled framework for combining SMC with\ndiffusion-based samplers by viewing both methods in continuous time and\nconsidering measures on path space. This culminates in the new Sequential\nControlled Langevin Diffusion (SCLD) sampling method, which is able to utilize\nthe benefits of both methods and reaches improved performance on multiple\nbenchmark problems, in many cases using only 10% of the training budget of\nprevious diffusion-based samplers.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) model creators commonly attach restrictive terms\nof use to both their models and their outputs. These terms typically prohibit\nactivities ranging from creating competing AI models to spreading\ndisinformation. Often taken at face value, these terms are positioned by\ncompanies as key enforceable tools for preventing misuse, particularly in\npolicy dialogs. But are these terms truly meaningful? There are myriad examples\nwhere these broad terms are regularly and repeatedly violated. Yet except for\nsome account suspensions on platforms, no model creator has actually tried to\nenforce these terms with monetary penalties or injunctive relief. This is\nlikely for good reason: we think that the legal enforceability of these\nlicenses is questionable.\n  This Article systematically assesses of the enforceability of AI model terms\nof use and offers three contributions. First, we pinpoint a key problem: the\nartifacts that they protect, namely model weights and model outputs, are\nlargely not copyrightable, making it unclear whether there is even anything to\nbe licensed. Second, we examine the problems this creates for other\nenforcement. Recent doctrinal trends in copyright preemption may further\nundermine state-law claims, while other legal frameworks like the DMCA and CFAA\noffer limited recourse. Anti-competitive provisions likely fare even worse than\nresponsible use provisions. Third, we provide recommendations to policymakers.\nThere are compelling reasons for many provisions to be unenforceable: they\nchill good faith research, constrain competition, and create quasi-copyright\nownership where none should exist. There are, of course, downsides: model\ncreators have fewer tools to prevent harmful misuse. But we think the better\napproach is for statutory provisions, not private fiat, to distinguish between\ngood and bad uses of AI, restricting the latter.",

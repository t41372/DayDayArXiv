    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) are capable of planning robot actions. In\nthis paper, we explore how LLMs can be used for planning actions with tasks\ninvolving situational human-robot interaction (HRI). A key problem of applying\nLLMs in situational HRI is balancing between \"respecting the current human's\nactivity\" and \"prioritizing the robot's task,\" as well as understanding the\ntiming of when to use the LLM to generate an action plan. In this paper, we\npropose a necessary plan-and-act skill design to solve the above problems. We\nshow that a critical factor for enabling a robot to switch between passive /\nactive interaction behavior is to provide the LLM with an action text about the\ncurrent robot's action. We also show that a second-stage question to the LLM\n(about the next timing to call the LLM) is necessary for planning actions at an\nappropriate timing. The skill design is applied to an Engage skill and is\ntested on four distinct interaction scenarios. We show that by using the skill\ndesign, LLMs can be leveraged to easily scale to different HRI scenarios with a\nreasonable success rate reaching 90% on the test scenarios.",

Modern conversational systems are based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs), which makes them prone to errors such as hallucinations, i.e.,\ninaccurate, fictitious, and therefore factually incorrect information. In this\npaper, we present an LLM-based methodology for the automatic factual\nbenchmarking of in-car conversational systems. We instantiate our methodology\nwith five LLM-based methods, leveraging ensembling techniques and diverse\npersonae to enhance agreement and minimize hallucinations. We use our\nmethodology to evaluate CarExpert, an in-car retrieval-augmented conversational\nquestion answering system, with respect to the factual correctness to a\nvehicle's manual. We produced a novel dataset specifically created for the\nin-car domain, and tested our methodology against an expert evaluation. Our\nresults show that the combination of GPT-4 with the Input Output Prompting\nachieves over 90 per cent factual correctness agreement rate with expert\nevaluations, other than being the most efficient approach yielding an average\nresponse time of 4.5s. Our findings suggest that LLM-based testing constitutes\na viable approach for the validation of conversational systems regarding their\nfactual correctness.",

While\ntraditional models assume that belief updates follow Bayesian principles,\nreal-world scenarios often involve hidden variables that impact the receiver's\nbelief formation and decision-making. We conceptualize this as a sequential\ndecision-making problem, where the sender and receiver interact over multiple\nrounds. In each round, the sender communicates with the receiver, who also\ninteracts with the environment. Crucially, the receiver's belief update is\naffected by an unobserved confounding variable. By reformulating this scenario\nas a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we capture the\nsender's incomplete information regarding both the dynamics of the receiver's\nbeliefs and the unobserved confounder. We prove that finding an optimal\nobservation-based policy in this POMDP is equivalent to solving for an optimal\nsignaling strategy in the original persuasion framework. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate how this reformulation facilitates the application of proximal\nlearning for off-policy evaluation in the persuasion process.

When users request\nthat LLMs \"cite reputable sources,\" \"express appropriate uncertainty,\" or\n\"include multiple perspectives,\" they discover that current interfaces provide\nno structured way to articulate these preferences. The result is prompt sharing\nfolklore: community-specific copied prompts passed through trust relationships\nrather than based on measured efficacy. We propose the Epistemic Alignment\nFramework, a set of ten challenges in knowledge transmission derived from the\nphilosophical literature of epistemology, concerning issues such as evidence\nquality assessment and calibration of testimonial reliance. The framework\nserves as a structured intermediary between user needs and system capabilities,\ncreating a common vocabulary to bridge the gap between what users want and what\nsystems deliver. Through a thematic analysis of custom prompts and\npersonalization strategies shared on online communities where these issues are\nactively discussed, we find users develop elaborate workarounds to address each\nof the challenges. We then apply our framework to two prominent model\nproviders, OpenAI and Anthropic, through content analysis of their documented\npolicies and product features. Our analysis shows that while these providers\nhave partially addressed the challenges we identified, they fail to establish\nadequate mechanisms for specifying epistemic preferences, lack transparency\nabout how preferences are implemented, and offer no verification tools to\nconfirm whether preferences were followed.

Motivated by behavioral insights that\nhuman judgments of fairness evolve with temporal distance, we introduce a novel\nframework for temporal fairness that incorporates past-discounting mechanisms.\nBy applying a tunable discount factor to historical utilities, our approach\ninterpolates between instantaneous and perfect-recall fairness, thereby\ncapturing both immediate outcomes and long-term equity considerations. Beyond\naligning more closely with human perceptions of fairness, this past-discounting\nmethod ensures that the augmented state space remains bounded, significantly\nimproving computational tractability in sequential decision-making settings. We\ndetail the formulation of discounted-recall fairness in both additive and\naveraged utility contexts, illustrate its benefits through practical examples,\nand discuss its implications for designing balanced, scalable resource\nallocation strategies.",

The recent integration of web search\nresults into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify\nthe generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online\nexperiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either\nstatic (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e.,\nparticipant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of\nLLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major\nhallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall\nevaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search\nresults). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic\nconditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and\nperceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition\nrated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall\nself-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control\nconditions.

This task is generally treated as a binary\njudgment of whether the claim is supported or unsupported in relation to the\nsource.

Forcing binary\nlabels upon such claims lowers the reliability of evaluation. In this work, we\nreframe the task to manage the subjectivity involved with factuality judgments\nof ambiguous claims. We introduce LLM-generated edits of summaries as a method\nof providing a nuanced evaluation of claims: how much does a summary need to be\nedited to be unambiguous? Whether a claim gets rewritten and how much it\nchanges can be used as an automatic evaluation metric, the Ambiguity Rewrite\nMetric (ARM), with a much richer feedback signal than a binary judgment of\nfaithfulness.

While these models have been primarily evaluated and\ndeveloped for front-view image understanding, their capabilities in\ninterpreting top-down images have received limited attention, partly due to the\nscarcity of diverse top-down datasets and the challenges in collecting such\ndata. In contrast, top-down vision provides explicit spatial overviews and\nimproved contextual understanding of scenes, making it particularly valuable\nfor tasks like autonomous navigation, aerial imaging, and spatial planning. In\nthis work, we address this gap by introducing TDBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for VLMs in top-down image understanding. TDBench is constructed from\npublic top-down view datasets and high-quality simulated images, including\ndiverse real-world and synthetic scenarios. TDBench consists of visual\nquestion-answer pairs across ten evaluation dimensions of image understanding.\nMoreover, we conduct four case studies that commonly happen in real-world\nscenarios but are less explored.

Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to\ntheir amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires\nexpert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale\nvideo instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current\nsegmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets,\nfeaturing $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$\nframes) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including\ndrones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse\nvisual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water\ncolor variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico,\nCosta Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New\nZealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic\nscenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without\nrip currents. We conduct comprehensive experiments with Mask R-CNN, Cascade\nMask R-CNN, SparseInst and YOLO11, fine-tuning these models for the task of rip\ncurrent segmentation. Results are reported in terms of multiple metrics, with a\nparticular focus on the $F_2$ score to prioritize recall and reduce false\nnegatives. To enhance segmentation performance, we introduce a novel\npost-processing step based on Temporal Confidence Aggregation (TCA). RipVIS\naims to set a new standard for rip current segmentation, contributing towards\nsafer beach environments.

In this paper, we introduce Multi-AudioJail, the first\nsystematic framework to exploit these vulnerabilities through (1) a novel\ndataset of adversarially perturbed multilingual/multi-accent audio jailbreaking\nprompts, and (2) a hierarchical evaluation pipeline revealing that how acoustic\nperturbations (e.g., reverberation, echo, and whisper effects) interacts with\ncross-lingual phonetics to cause jailbreak success rates (JSRs) to surge by up\nto +57.25 percentage points (e.g., reverberated Kenyan-accented attack on\nMERaLiON). Crucially, our work further reveals that multimodal LLMs are\ninherently more vulnerable than unimodal systems: attackers need only exploit\nthe weakest link (e.g., non-English audio inputs) to compromise the entire\nmodel, which we empirically show by multilingual audio-only attacks achieving\n3.1x higher success rates than text-only attacks.

A traditional approach, Self-Consistency\n(SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common\nanswer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each\nsolution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent\nadvancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a\nnext-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis.\nSpecifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score\neach solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental\ntrade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate\nfewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address\nthis, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget.\nInterestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most\npractical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance,\nGenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and\nrequires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive\ninference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal\ninference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the\nnumber of verifications.

Failing to\nreject the null is uninformative, but rejecting it at a specific token\nindicates that token has a statistically significant local structure, and so is\nof interest to us. By running our test over several open-source LLMs, each with\nunique token embeddings, we find that the null is frequently rejected, and so\nthe token subspace is provably not a fiber bundle and hence also not a\nmanifold.

In many cases, it has been observed that first-order temporal\nrelationships have proven to be sufficient without any significant loss in\nefficiency. This paper introduces a Reflex Memory (RM) block, inspired by the\nSpinal Cord's working mechanisms, designed to accelerate the processing of\nfirst-order inferences. The RM block performs these inferences significantly\nfaster than the SM. The integration of RM with HTM forms a system called the\nAccelerated Hierarchical Temporal Memory (AHTM), which processes repetitive\ninformation more efficiently than the original HTM while still supporting\nmultiorder inferences. The experimental results demonstrate that the HTM\npredicts an event in 0.945 s, whereas the AHTM module does so in 0.125 s.\nAdditionally, the hardware implementation of RM in a content-addressable memory\n(CAM) block, known as Hardware-Accelerated Hierarchical Temporal Memory\n(H-AHTM), predicts an event in just 0.094 s, significantly improving inference\nspeed. Compared to the original algorithm \\cite{bautista2020matlabhtm}, AHTM\naccelerates inference by up to 7.55x, while H-AHTM further enhances performance\nwith a 10.10x speedup.",

    "abstract": "As language models improve and become capable of performing more complex\ntasks across modalities, evaluating them automatically becomes increasingly\nchallenging. Developing strong and robust task-specific automatic metrics gets\nharder, and human-annotated test sets -- which are expensive to create --\nsaturate more quickly. A compelling alternative is to design reliable\nstrategies to automate the creation of test data and evaluation, but previous\nattempts either rely on pre-existing data, or focus solely on individual tasks.\nWe present Zero-shot Benchmarking (ZSB), a framework for creating high-quality\nbenchmarks for any task by leveraging language models for both synthetic test\ndata creation and evaluation. ZSB is simple and flexible: it requires only the\ncreation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation; it is scalable\nto tasks and languages where collecting real-world data is costly or\nimpractical; it is model-agnostic, allowing the creation of increasingly\nchallenging benchmarks as models improve. To assess the effectiveness of our\nframework, we create benchmarks for five text-only tasks and a multi-modal one:\ngeneral capabilities in four languages (English, Chinese, French, and Korean),\ntranslation, and general vision-language capabilities in English. We then rank\na broad range of open and closed systems on our benchmarks. ZSB rankings\nconsistently correlate strongly with human rankings, outperforming\nwidely-adopted standard benchmarks. Through ablations, we find that strong\nbenchmarks can be created with open models, and that judge model size and\ndataset variety are crucial drivers of performance. We release all our\nbenchmarks, and code to reproduce our experiments and to produce new\nbenchmarks.",

Unlike mathematical\nreasoning, medical reasoning demands meticulous, verifiable thought processes\nto ensure reliability and accuracy. However, there is a notable lack of\ndatasets that provide transparent, step-by-step reasoning to validate and\nenhance the medical reasoning ability of AI models. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MedReason, a large-scale high-quality medical reasoning dataset\ndesigned to enable faithful and explainable medical problem-solving in large\nlanguage models (LLMs). We utilize a structured medical knowledge graph (KG) to\nconvert clinical QA pairs into logical chains of reasoning, or ``thinking\npaths'', which trace connections from question elements to answers via relevant\nKG entities. Each path is validated for consistency with clinical logic and\nevidence-based medicine. Our pipeline generates detailed reasoning for various\nmedical questions from 7 medical datasets, resulting in a dataset of 32,682\nquestion-answer pairs, each with detailed, step-by-step explanations.\nExperiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our dataset consistently boosts\nmedical problem-solving capabilities, achieving significant gains of up to 7.7%\nfor DeepSeek-Ditill-8B.

    "abstract": "Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges\nwhen processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the\nkey-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive\ngeneration, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational\nefficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook\nsemantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their\nsemantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache\nmanagement approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high\ntime-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a\nnovel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference\nefficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV\ngroups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence\nrepresentations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while\nindividual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates\ntokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV\nentries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage\nsemantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and\ncontextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or\nirrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead\nwhile maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts.\nExtensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and\nNeedle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without\ncompromising model accuracy.",

Recently, Spiking Vision Transformer\n(SViT)-based models have emerged as alternate low-power ViT networks. However,\ntheir large memory footprints still hinder their applicability for\nresource-constrained embedded AI systems. Therefore, there is a need for a\nmethodology to compress SViT models without degrading the accuracy\nsignificantly. To address this, we propose QSViT, a novel design methodology to\ncompress the SViT models through a systematic quantization strategy across\ndifferent network layers. To do this, our QSViT employs several key steps: (1)\ninvestigating the impact of different precision levels in different network\nlayers, (2) identifying the appropriate base quantization settings for guiding\nbit precision reduction, (3) performing a guided quantization strategy based on\nthe base settings to select the appropriate quantization setting, and (4)\ndeveloping an efficient quantized network based on the selected quantization\nsetting. The experimental results demonstrate that, our QSViT methodology\nachieves 22.75% memory saving and 21.33% power saving, while also maintaining\nhigh accuracy within 2.1% from that of the original non-quantized SViT model on\nthe ImageNet dataset. These results highlight the potential of QSViT\nmethodology to pave the way toward the efficient SViT deployments on\nresource-constrained embedded AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a serious brain infection\ncaused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, characterized by inflammation of the\nmeninges covering the brain and spinal cord. Diagnosis often requires invasive\nlumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Objectives: This\nstudy aims to classify TBM patients using T1-weighted (T1w) non-contrast\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. We hypothesize that specific brain\nregions, such as the interpeduncular cisterns, bone, and corpus callosum,\ncontain visual markers that can non-invasively distinguish TBM patients from\nhealthy controls. We propose a novel Pixel-array Graphs Classifier\n(PAG-Classifier) that leverages spatial relationships between neighbouring 3D\npixels in a graph-based framework to extract significant features through eigen\ndecomposition. These features are then used to train machine learning\nclassifiers for effective patient classification. We validate our approach\nusing a radiomics-based methodology, classifying TBM patients based on relevant\nradiomics features. Results: We utilized an internal dataset consisting of 52\nscans, 32 from confirmed TBM patients based on mycobacteria detection in CSF,\nand 20 from healthy individuals. We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated average\nF1 score of 85.71% for cistern regions with our PAG-Classifier and 92.85% with\nthe radiomics features classifier, surpassing current state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks by 15% and 22%, respectively. However, bone and corpus callosum\nregions showed poor classification effectiveness, with average F1 scores below\n50%. Conclusion: Our study suggests that algorithms like the PAG-Classifier\nserve as effective tools for non-invasive TBM analysis, particularly by\ntargeting the interpeduncular cistern. Findings indicate that the bone and\ncorpus callosum regions lack distinctive patterns for differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The subjective evaluation of early stage engineering designs, such as\nconceptual sketches, traditionally relies on human experts. However, expert\nevaluations are time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes inconsistent. Recent\nadvances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer the potential to automate\ndesign assessments, but it is crucial to ensure that these AI ``judges''\nperform on par with human experts. However, no existing framework assesses\nexpert equivalence. This paper introduces a rigorous statistical framework to\ndetermine whether an AI judge's ratings match those of human experts. We apply\nthis framework in a case study evaluating four VLM-based judges on key design\nmetrics (uniqueness, creativity, usefulness, and drawing quality). These AI\njudges employ various in-context learning (ICL) techniques, including uni- vs.\nmultimodal prompts and inference-time reasoning. The same statistical framework\nis used to assess three trained novices for expert-equivalence. Results show\nthat the top-performing AI judge, using text- and image-based ICL with\nreasoning, achieves expert-level agreement for uniqueness and drawing quality\nand outperforms or matches trained novices across all metrics. In 6/6 runs for\nboth uniqueness and creativity, and 5/6 runs for both drawing quality and\nusefulness, its agreement with experts meets or exceeds that of the majority of\ntrained novices. These findings suggest that reasoning-supported VLM models can\nachieve human-expert equivalence in design evaluation. This has implications\nfor scaling design evaluation in education and practice, and provides a general\nstatistical framework for validating AI judges in other domains requiring\nsubjective content evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its effectiveness in\nmedical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally\ndiffers from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and\ndecision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive\ninvestigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a\nsimple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning\ncapability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks\ndemonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning,\nenabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new\nstate-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale\nmedical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of\napproximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking.\nBudget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts,\nhelps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall\nmedical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into\npreviously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient\nmedical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains\nthrough test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data\nquality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge\ngrounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on\nchallenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These\nfindings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical\nreasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than\nincreased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of\ntest-time scaling.",

Traditional detection methods, including rule-based and\nmachine learning-based approaches, struggle to accurately identify emerging\nthreats, particularly in scenarios with limited samples. While recent advances\nin few-shot learning have partially addressed the data scarcity issue, existing\nmethods still exhibit high false positive rates and lack the capability to\neffectively capture crucial local traffic patterns.

We\nfurther design a session similarity assessment module that integrates local\nsimilarity with global self-attention-enhanced representations, achieving\naccurate and robust few-shot traffic classification. Comprehensive experiments\non three meticulously reconstructed datasets demonstrate that HLoG\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods typically leverage data augmentation to enhance\nsample diversity or employ knowledge distillation to learn invariant\nrepresentations.

To\naddress these issues, this paper presents a global intervention and\ndistillation method, termed FedGID, which utilizes diverse attribute features\nfor backdoor adjustment to break the spurious association between background\nand label. It includes two main modules, where the global intervention module\nadaptively decouples objects and backgrounds in images, injects background\ninformation into random samples to intervene in the sample distribution, which\nlinks backgrounds to all categories to prevent the model from treating\nbackground-label associations as causal. The global distillation module\nleverages a unified knowledge base to guide the representation learning of\nclient models, preventing local models from overfitting to client-specific\nattributes.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simple, effective, and cost-efficient strategy to\nimprove LLM performance by scaling test-time compute. Our strategy builds upon\nthe repeated-sampling-then-voting framework, with a novel twist: incorporating\nmultiple models, even weaker ones, to leverage their complementary strengths\nthat potentially arise from diverse training data and paradigms. By using\nconsistency as a signal, our strategy dynamically switches between models.\nTheoretical analysis highlights the efficiency and performance advantages of\nour strategy. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our\nstrategy not only outperforms self-consistency and state-of-the-art multi-agent\ndebate approaches, but also significantly reduces inference costs.\nAdditionally, ModelSwitch requires only a few comparable LLMs to achieve\noptimal performance and can be extended with verification methods,\ndemonstrating the potential of leveraging multiple LLMs in the\ngeneration-verification paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Resume screening is a critical yet time-intensive process in talent\nacquisition, requiring recruiters to analyze vast volume of job applications\nwhile remaining objective, accurate, and fair. With the advancements in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), their reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge\nbases demonstrate new opportunities to streamline and automate recruitment\nworkflows. In this work, we propose a multi-agent framework for resume\nscreening using LLMs to systematically process and evaluate resumes. The\nframework consists of four core agents, including a resume extractor, an\nevaluator, a summarizer, and a score formatter. To enhance the contextual\nrelevance of candidate assessments, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) within the resume evaluator, allowing incorporation of external knowledge\nsources, such as industry-specific expertise, professional certifications,\nuniversity rankings, and company-specific hiring criteria. This dynamic\nadaptation enables personalized recruitment, bridging the gap between AI\nautomation and talent acquisition. We assess the effectiveness of our approach\nby comparing AI-generated scores with ratings provided by HR professionals on a\ndataset of anonymized online resumes. The findings highlight the potential of\nmulti-agent RAG-LLM systems in automating resume screening, enabling more\nefficient and scalable hiring workflows.",

At the receiver, a Facebook AI\nSimilarity Search (FAISS) based vector database is constructed by extracting\nsemantic embeddings from images using the Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-Training (CLIP) model. During transmission, the transmitter first extracts\na 512-dimensional semantic feature using the CLIP model, then compresses it\nwith a lightweight neural network for transmission. After receiving the signal,\nthe receiver reconstructs the feature back to 512 dimensions and performs\nsimilarity matching from the KB to retrieve the most semantically similar\nimage. Semantic transmission success is determined by category consistency\nbetween the transmitted and retrieved images, rather than traditional metrics\nlike Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The proposed system prioritizes\nsemantic accuracy, offering a new evaluation paradigm for semantic-aware\ncommunication systems. Experimental validation on CIFAR100 demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the framework in achieving semantic image transmission.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal optimization involves identifying multiple global and local\noptima of a function, offering valuable insights into diverse optimal solutions\nwithin the search space. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) excel at finding\nmultiple solutions in a single run, providing a distinct advantage over\nclassical optimization techniques that often require multiple restarts without\nguarantee of obtaining diverse solutions. Among these EAs, differential\nevolution (DE) stands out as a powerful and versatile optimizer for continuous\nparameter spaces. DE has shown significant success in multi-modal optimization\nby utilizing its population-based search to promote the formation of multiple\nstable subpopulations, each targeting different optima. Recent advancements in\nDE for multi-modal optimization have focused on niching methods, parameter\nadaptation, hybridization with other algorithms including machine learning, and\napplications across various domains. Given these developments, it is an\nopportune moment to present a critical review of the latest literature and\nidentify key future research directions. This paper offers a comprehensive\noverview of recent DE advancements in multimodal optimization, including\nmethods for handling multiple optima, hybridization with EAs, and machine\nlearning, and highlights a range of real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Humans can continuously acquire new skills and knowledge by exploiting\nexisting ones for improved learning, without forgetting them. Similarly,\n'continual learning' in machine learning aims to learn new information while\npreserving the previously acquired knowledge. Existing research often overlooks\nthe nature of human learning, where tasks are interleaved due to human choice\nor environmental constraints. So, almost never do humans master one task before\nswitching to the next. To investigate to what extent human-like learning can\nbenefit the learner, we propose a method that interleaves tasks based on their\n'learning progress' and energy consumption. From a machine learning\nperspective, our approach can be seen as a multi-task learning system that\nbalances learning performance with energy constraints while mimicking\necologically realistic human task learning. To assess the validity of our\napproach, we consider a robot learning setting in simulation, where the robot\nlearns the effect of its actions in different contexts. The conducted\nexperiments show that our proposed method achieves better performance than\nsequential task learning and reduces energy consumption for learning the tasks.",

    "abstract": "Generative models, such as GPT and BERT, have significantly improved\nperformance in tasks like text generation and summarization. However,\nhallucinations \"where models generate non-factual or misleading content\" are\nespecially problematic in smaller-scale architectures, limiting their\nreal-world applicability.In this paper, we propose a unified Virtual\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion strategy that enhances inference performance\nand mitigates hallucinations in a single Qwen 1.5 0.5B model without increasing\nthe parameter count. Our method leverages multiple domain-specific expert\nprompts (with the number of experts being adjustable) to guide the model from\ndifferent perspectives. We apply a statistical outlier truncation strategy\nbased on the mean and standard deviation to filter out abnormally high\nprobability predictions, and we inject noise into the embedding space to\npromote output diversity. To clearly assess the contribution of each module, we\nadopt a fixed voting mechanism rather than a dynamic gating network, thereby\navoiding additional confounding factors. We provide detailed theoretical\nderivations from both statistical and ensemble learning perspectives to\ndemonstrate how our method reduces output variance and suppresses\nhallucinations. Extensive ablation experiments on dialogue generation tasks\nshow that our approach significantly improves inference accuracy and robustness\nin small models. Additionally, we discuss methods for evaluating the\northogonality of virtual experts and outline the potential for future work\ninvolving dynamic expert weight allocation using gating networks.",

    "abstract": "Clifford circuit optimization is an important step in the quantum compilation\npipeline. Major compilers employ heuristic approaches. While they are fast,\ntheir results are often suboptimal. Minimization of noisy gates, like 2-qubit\nCNOT gates, is crucial for practical computing. Exact approaches have been\nproposed to fill the gap left by heuristic approaches. Among these are SAT\nbased approaches that optimize gate count or depth, but they suffer from\nscalability issues. Further, they do not guarantee optimality on more important\nmetrics like CNOT count or CNOT depth. A recent work proposed an exhaustive\nsearch only on Clifford circuits in a certain normal form to guarantee CNOT\ncount optimality. But an exhaustive approach cannot scale beyond 6 qubits.\n  In this paper, we incorporate search restricted to Clifford normal forms in a\nSAT encoding to guarantee CNOT count optimality. By allowing parallel plans, we\npropose a second SAT encoding that optimizes CNOT depth. By taking advantage of\nflexibility in SAT based approaches, we also handle connectivity restrictions\nin hardware platforms, and allow for qubit relabeling. We have implemented the\nabove encodings and variations in our open source tool Q-Synth.\n  In experiments, our encodings significantly outperform existing SAT\napproaches on random Clifford circuits. We consider practical VQE and Feynman\nbenchmarks to compare with TKET and Qiskit compilers. In all-to-all\nconnectivity, we observe reductions up to 32.1% in CNOT count and 48.1% in CNOT\ndepth. Overall, we observe better results than TKET in the CNOT count and\ndepth. We also experiment with connectivity restrictions of major quantum\nplatforms. Compared to Qiskit, we observe up to 30.3% CNOT count and 35.9% CNOT\ndepth further reduction.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces feature subset weighting using monotone measures for\ndistance-based supervised learning. The Choquet integral is used to define a\ndistance metric that incorporates these weights. This integration enables the\nproposed distances to effectively capture non-linear relationships and account\nfor interactions both between conditional and decision attributes and among\nconditional attributes themselves, resulting in a more flexible distance\nmeasure. In particular, we show how this approach ensures that the distances\nremain unaffected by the addition of duplicate and strongly correlated\nfeatures. Another key point of this approach is that it makes feature subset\nweighting computationally feasible, since only $m$ feature subset weights\nshould be calculated each time instead of calculating all feature subset\nweights ($2^m$), where $m$ is the number of attributes. Next, we also examine\nhow the use of the Choquet integral for measuring similarity leads to a\nnon-equivalent definition of distance. The relationship between distance and\nsimilarity is further explored through dual measures. Additionally, symmetric\nChoquet distances and similarities are proposed, preserving the classical\nsymmetry between similarity and distance. Finally, we introduce a concrete\nfeature subset weighting distance, evaluate its performance in a $k$-nearest\nneighbors (KNN) classification setting, and compare it against Mahalanobis\ndistances and weighted distance methods.",

Interestingly, symbolic and\nsub-symbolic methods emphasized different factors in their decision-making:\nsymbolic approaches primarily relied on cognitive and motivational factors,\nwhile sub-symbolic methods focused more on cognitive aspects, learnt knowledge,\nand the demographic variable of gender -- yet both largely overlooked\nmetacognitive factors. The NSAI method, on the other hand, showed advantages\nby: (i) being more generalizable across both classes -- even in imbalanced\ndatasets -- as its symbolic knowledge component compensated for the\nunderrepresented class; and (ii) relying on a more integrated set of factors in\nits decision-making, including motivation, (meta)cognition, and learnt\nknowledge, thus offering a comprehensive and theoretically grounded\ninterpretability framework.

    "abstract": "As the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) expands, it\nbecomes increasingly critical to develop a unified approach that improves\nperformance across various generative tasks. One effective strategy that\napplies to any machine learning task is identifying harmful instances, whose\nremoval improves the performance. While previous studies have successfully\nestimated these harmful training instances in supervised settings, their\napproaches are not easily applicable to GANs. The challenge lies in two\nrequirements of the previous approaches that do not apply to GANs. First,\nprevious approaches require that the absence of a training instance directly\naffects the parameters. However, in the training for GANs, the instances do not\ndirectly affect the generator's parameters since they are only fed into the\ndiscriminator. Second, previous approaches assume that the change in loss\ndirectly quantifies the harmfulness of the instance to a model's performance,\nwhile common types of GAN losses do not always reflect the generative\nperformance. To overcome the first challenge, we propose influence estimation\nmethods that use the Jacobian of the generator's gradient with respect to the\ndiscriminator's parameters (and vice versa). Such a Jacobian represents the\nindirect effect between two models: how removing an instance from the\ndiscriminator's training changes the generator's parameters. Second, we propose\nan instance evaluation scheme that measures the harmfulness of each training\ninstance based on how a GAN evaluation metric (e.g., Inception score) is\nexpected to change by the instance's removal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nremoving the identified harmful instances significantly improves the generative\nperformance on various GAN evaluation metrics.",

In this paper, we\nconduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of\na relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected\nlanguage, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple\n`distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our\nexperiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48\nlanguages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant\ninformation from out-language passages, but a much weaker ability to formulate\na full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and\nfeature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages\nnegatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However,\ndistractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken\ntogether, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in\nmRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.",

    "abstract": "Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks\nsuch as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior\nstudies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO,\nRoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent\nadvancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior\nperformance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to\nthe bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of\nthese models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an\nin-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of\ncutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant\nlack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text\npairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that\ndifferent tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation\ninformation among other semantic information, a data-efficient and\ncomputational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without\nmodifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is\nable to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both\nsimple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task.\nFurthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation\nawareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional\nuniversal text embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across\ndiverse domains, yet they still encounter challenges such as insufficient\ndomain-specific knowledge, biases, and hallucinations. This underscores the\nneed for robust evaluation methodologies to accurately assess LLM-based\napplications. Traditional evaluation methods, which rely on word overlap or\ntext embeddings, are inadequate for capturing the nuanced semantic information\nnecessary to evaluate dynamic, open-ended text generation. Recent research has\nexplored leveraging LLMs to mimic human reasoning and decision-making processes\nfor evaluation purposes known as LLM-as-a-judge framework. However, these\nexisting frameworks have two significant limitations. First, they lack the\nflexibility to adapt to different text styles, including various answer and\nground truth styles, thereby reducing their generalization performance. Second,\nthe evaluation scores produced by these frameworks are often skewed and hard to\ninterpret, showing a low correlation with human judgment. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel dynamic multi-agent system that automatically\ndesigns personalized LLM judges for various natural language generation\napplications. This system iteratively refines evaluation prompts and balances\nthe trade-off between the adaptive requirements of downstream tasks and the\nalignment with human perception. Our experimental results show that the\nproposed multi-agent LLM Judge framework not only enhances evaluation accuracy\ncompared to existing methods but also produces evaluation scores that better\nalign with human perception.",

    "abstract": "There has been a significant increase in the deployment of neural network\nmodels, presenting substantial challenges in model adaptation and fine-tuning.\nEfficient adaptation is crucial in maintaining model performance across diverse\ntasks and domains. While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning method, its fixed parameter nature limits its\nability to handle dynamic task requirements effectively. Adapting models to new\ntasks can be challenging due to the need for extensive fine-tuning. Current\nLoRA variants primarily focus on general parameter reduction while overlooking\nthe importance of dynamic parameter adjustment and meta-learning capabilities.\nMoreover, existing approaches mainly address static adaptations, neglecting the\npotential benefits of task-aware parameter generation in handling diverse task\ndistributions. To address these limitations, this Ph.D. research proposes a\nLoRA generation approach to model task relationships and introduces MetaLoRA, a\nnovel parameter-efficient adaptation framework incorporating meta-learning\nprinciples. This work develops a comprehensive architecture that integrates\nmeta-parameter generation with adaptive low-rank decomposition, enabling\nefficient handling of both task-specific and task-agnostic features. MetaLoRA\naccurately captures task patterns by incorporating meta-learning mechanisms and\ndynamic parameter adjustment strategies. To our knowledge, this research\nrepresents the first attempt to provide a meta-learning enhanced LoRA variant,\noffering improved adaptation capability while maintaining computational\nefficiency in model fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "We introduce DD3G, a formulation that Distills a multi-view Diffusion model\n(MV-DM) into a 3D Generator using gaussian splatting. DD3G compresses and\nintegrates extensive visual and spatial geometric knowledge from the MV-DM by\nsimulating its ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory, ensuring the\ndistilled generator generalizes better than those trained solely on 3D data.\nUnlike previous amortized optimization approaches, we align the MV-DM and 3D\ngenerator representation spaces to transfer the teacher's probabilistic flow to\nthe student, thus avoiding inconsistencies in optimization objectives caused by\nprobabilistic sampling. The introduction of probabilistic flow and the coupling\nof various attributes in 3D Gaussians introduce challenges in the generation\nprocess. To tackle this, we propose PEPD, a generator consisting of Pattern\nExtraction and Progressive Decoding phases, which enables efficient fusion of\nprobabilistic flow and converts a single image into 3D Gaussians within 0.06\nseconds. Furthermore, to reduce knowledge loss and overcome sparse-view\nsupervision, we design a joint optimization objective that ensures the quality\nof generated samples through explicit supervision and implicit verification.\nLeveraging existing 2D generation models, we compile 120k high-quality RGBA\nimages for distillation.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in\nenhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its\nefficiency remains a challenge due to the generation of excessive intermediate\nreasoning tokens, which introduce semantic redundancy and overly detailed\nreasoning steps. Moreover, computational expense and latency are significant\nconcerns, as the cost scales with the number of output tokens, including those\nintermediate steps. In this work, we observe that most CoT tokens are\nunnecessary, and retaining only a small portion of them is sufficient for\nproducing high-quality responses. Inspired by this, we propose HAWKEYE, a novel\npost-training and inference framework where a large model produces concise CoT\ninstructions to guide a smaller model in response generation. HAWKEYE\nquantifies redundancy in CoT reasoning and distills high-density information\nvia reinforcement learning. By leveraging these concise CoTs, HAWKEYE is able\nto expand responses while reducing token usage and computational cost\nsignificantly. Our evaluation shows that HAWKEYE can achieve comparable\nresponse quality using only 35% of the full CoTs, while improving clarity,\ncoherence, and conciseness by approximately 10%. Furthermore, HAWKEYE can\naccelerate end-to-end reasoning by up to 3.4x on complex math tasks while\nreducing inference cost by up to 60%.

For the former, we encourage\nthe denoised image to approximate pseudo labels following the wide-angle\ndistortion distribution pattern, while for the latter, we derive rectification\ntrajectories with backward optical flows and smooth them.

    "abstract": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of\nintelligent educational tools that support inquiry-based learning across\ntechnical domains. In cybersecurity education, where accuracy and safety are\nparamount, systems must go beyond surface-level relevance to provide\ninformation that is both trustworthy and domain-appropriate. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce CyberBOT, a question-answering chatbot that leverages a\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to incorporate contextual\ninformation from course-specific materials and validate responses using a\ndomain-specific cybersecurity ontology. The ontology serves as a structured\nreasoning layer that constrains and verifies LLM-generated answers, reducing\nthe risk of misleading or unsafe guidance. CyberBOT has been deployed in a\nlarge graduate-level course at Arizona State University (ASU), where more than\none hundred students actively engage with the system through a dedicated\nweb-based platform. Computational evaluations in lab environments highlight the\npotential capacity of CyberBOT, and a forthcoming field study will evaluate its\npedagogical impact. By integrating structured domain reasoning with modern\ngenerative capabilities, CyberBOT illustrates a promising direction for\ndeveloping reliable and curriculum-aligned AI applications in specialized\neducational contexts.",

We investigate this risk in a single-turn,\nmulti-agent debate framework: one LLM-based agent provides a factual answer\nfrom TruthfulQA, another vigorously defends a falsehood, and the same LLM\narchitecture serves as judge. We introduce the Confidence-Weighted Persuasion\nOverride Rate (CW-POR), which captures not only how often the judge is deceived\nbut also how strongly it believes the incorrect choice. Our experiments on five\nopen-source LLMs (3B-14B parameters), where we systematically vary agent\nverbosity (30-300 words), reveal that even smaller models can craft persuasive\narguments that override truthful answers-often with high confidence.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in zero-shot referring image segmentation (RIS), driven by\nmodels such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP, have made substantial\nprogress in aligning visual and textual information. Despite these successes,\nthe extraction of precise and high-quality mask region representations remains\na critical challenge, limiting the full potential of RIS tasks. In this paper,\nwe introduce a training-free, hybrid global-local feature extraction approach\nthat integrates detailed mask-specific features with contextual information\nfrom the surrounding area, enhancing mask region representation. To further\nstrengthen alignment between mask regions and referring expressions, we propose\na spatial guidance augmentation strategy that improves spatial coherence, which\nis essential for accurately localizing described areas. By incorporating\nmultiple spatial cues, this approach facilitates more robust and precise\nreferring segmentation. Extensive experiments on standard RIS benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing zero-shot RIS\nmodels, achieving substantial performance gains.

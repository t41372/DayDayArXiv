    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,\nexemplified by GitHub Copilot\\footnote{A coding extension powered by a Code-LLM\nto assist in code completion tasks} surpassing a million users, highlights the\ntransformative potential of these tools in improving developer productivity.\nHowever, this rapid growth also underscores critical concerns regarding the\nquality, safety, and reliability of the code they generate.

To address\nthese issues, this paper introduces Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD), a\nnovel approach that leverages adversarially generated synthetic datasets to\ndistill the capabilities of larger models into smaller, more efficient ones. By\nsystematically stress-testing and refining the reasoning capabilities of\nCode-LLMs, AKD provides a framework for enhancing model robustness,\nreliability, and security while improving their parameter-efficiency.

Recent work on audio LMs has primarily\nevaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30\nseconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments\nthat more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We\nintroduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio\nbenchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation,\nemotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in\nlength. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each\npaired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers.\nOur audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent\na human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six\nopen-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them,\nincluding advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the\ntasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the\ntrade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that\naudio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as\nduration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning,\ncounting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on\nprompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework\nto develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting\nfundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational\nirreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a\n\"minimal agent\" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments.\nUsing algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability\nand computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to\nunpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective\ngoal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external\nprediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate\nthis to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of\nits behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central\nthesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies\nundecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems\nfrom predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment\ncoupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and\nrelevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical\nsolutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This\nframework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction,\noffering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI,\nand reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally\nirreducible universe.",

Large language models have\ndemonstrated powerful multimodal capabilities including the ability to generate\nand adapt text, audio, and visual content. Educational research has yet to\nfully explore their potential in creating personalized audiovisual learning\nenvironments. To address this gap, we introduce an AI-powered system that uses\nLLMs to generate personalized multisensory study environments.

    "abstract": "Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling\nnatural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent\nambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing\nusers to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an\niterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a\nstructured series of clarification questions and alternative solution\nproposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every\nuncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a\ndiverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our\nmethod demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher\nuser satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically\nrequire multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.",

    "abstract": "Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to\nidentify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a\ncommon strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to\nthe thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently,\nself-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds\nguided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and\ndisregards different numbers of outputs.\n  We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the\ngeneration of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing\na limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs\n- DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR\ntask. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K,\n30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess\ntheir repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.\n  Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning\ndataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible\npatches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using\nFull Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to\ndiminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base\nmodels greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather\nthan generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative\nstrategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned\nmodels, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages,\nparticularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for\nbalanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative\nrefinement.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has\nan extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ\nfailure, and potentially death. Because sepsis can worsen rapidly, early\ndetection is critical to saving lives. However, current diagnostic methods\noften identify sepsis only after significant damage has already occurred. Our\nproject aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based\nsystem to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more\ntime to intervene.\n  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient\ninformation or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab\nresults. This inconsistency makes models difficult to compare and limits their\nability to work across different hospitals and settings. To solve this, we\npropose a method called Feature Aligned Transfer Learning (FATL), which\nidentifies and focuses on the most important and commonly reported features\nacross multiple studies, ensuring the model remains consistent and clinically\nrelevant.\n  Most existing models are trained on narrow patient groups, leading to\npopulation bias. FATL addresses this by combining knowledge from models trained\non diverse populations, using a weighted approach that reflects each models\ncontribution. This makes the system more generalizable and effective across\ndifferent patient demographics and clinical environments. FATL offers a\npractical and scalable solution for early sepsis detection, particularly in\nhospitals with limited resources, and has the potential to improve patient\noutcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and support more equitable healthcare\ndelivery.",

However, the\ngrowing trend of fine-tuning pre-trained models for personalization raises\nserious concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To combat this, dataset\nownership verification (DOV) has emerged as a solution, embedding watermarks\ninto the fine-tuning datasets using backdoor techniques. These watermarks\nremain inactive under benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when\ntriggered. Despite the promise of DOV for T2I diffusion models, its robustness\nagainst copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we\nexplore how attackers can bypass these mechanisms through CEA, allowing models\nto circumvent watermarks even when trained on watermarked datasets. We propose\nthe first copyright evasion attack (i.e., CEAT2I) specifically designed to\nundermine DOV in T2I diffusion models. Concretely, our CEAT2I comprises three\nstages: watermarked sample detection, trigger identification, and efficient\nwatermark mitigation. A key insight driving our approach is that T2I models\nexhibit faster convergence on watermarked samples during the fine-tuning,\nevident through intermediate feature deviation. Leveraging this, CEAT2I can\nreliably detect the watermarked samples. Then, we iteratively ablate tokens\nfrom the prompts of detected watermarked samples and monitor shifts in\nintermediate features to pinpoint the exact trigger tokens. Finally, we adopt a\nclosed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermark. Extensive\nexperiments show that our CEAT2I effectively evades DOV mechanisms while\npreserving model performance.",

We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent\nevaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., \"If you find that\nthe button is disabled, don't click it again\", or \"This agent has too much\nautonomy to decide what to do on its own\", into metrics for evaluating\nfine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by\ngrounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and\nnegative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and\nconcrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as\nevaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a\nset of (induced) metrics with open feedback: \"coverage\" and \"redundancy\".\nThrough optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate\nAutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the\nones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics\nto analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent\nimprovement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better\nprompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text\ngame tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance.\n  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,\n\\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and\nmulti-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system\nself-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs\nwith intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic\ntraining data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,\nwhich are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and\nunsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information\nsufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG\nsystem has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval\ndecisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context\nreinforcement learning.\n  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an\neffective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is\nsystem-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring\nmodifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,\neliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process\nsupervision data.",

    "abstract": "Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases\nlike cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense\nscale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the\nlimited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning\nand zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue,\nand slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our\nmixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these\nchallenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing\ncumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using\nnatural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace.\nPathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function\ninstantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases\nside-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid\ncomparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers\nreal-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among\npathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of\ntraditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis\nimproves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology\npractice more effective and engaging.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool for\ndiagnosis, assessment, and intervention for individuals with Autism Spectrum\nDisorder (ASD). It focuses particularly on AI's role in early diagnosis,\nutilizing advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis. Recent\nstudies demonstrate that deep learning algorithms can identify behavioral\npatterns through biometric data analysis, video-based interaction assessments,\nand linguistic feature extraction, providing a more accurate and timely\ndiagnosis compared to traditional methods. Additionally, AI automates\ndiagnostic tools, reducing subjective biases and enabling the development of\npersonalized assessment protocols for ASD monitoring. At the same time, the\npaper examines AI-powered intervention technologies, emphasizing educational\nrobots and adaptive communication tools. Social robotic assistants, such as NAO\nand Kaspar, have been shown to enhance social skills in children by offering\nstructured, repetitive interactions that reinforce learning. Furthermore,\nAI-driven Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems allow\nchildren with ASD to express themselves more effectively, while\nmachine-learning chatbots provide language development support through\npersonalized responses. The study presents research findings supporting the\neffectiveness of these AI applications while addressing challenges such as\nlong-term evaluation and customization to individual needs. In conclusion, the\npaper highlights the significance of AI as an innovative tool in ASD diagnosis\nand intervention, advocating for further research to assess its long-term\nimpact.",

Notably, they can\napproach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the\nneed for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some\nchallenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or\nmissing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems\ncannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a\ntime-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information\nto enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for\nzero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the\nhierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune\nthe candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input\nprompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets\nshows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only\nenhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific\nmodels.

To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we\nintroduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates:\n(1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization,\n(2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering\nstrategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert\nannotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification\nwhile ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant\nlimitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under\npractical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling\nin algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation\ntactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between\nnatural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought\nreasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning\nintroduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings.

When these agents operate independently for extended periods without\nhuman oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift.\nDetecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its\noriginal objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can\nshift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents\nare first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to\ncompeting objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while\nthe best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains\nnearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most\ndifficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal\ndrift.

Voila moves beyond traditional\npipeline systems by adopting a new end-to-end architecture that enables\nfull-duplex, low-latency conversations while preserving rich vocal nuances such\nas tone, rhythm, and emotion. It achieves a response latency of just 195\nmilliseconds, surpassing the average human response time. Its hierarchical\nmulti-scale Transformer integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) with powerful acoustic modeling, enabling natural, persona-aware\nvoice generation -- where users can simply write text instructions to define\nthe speaker's identity, tone, and other characteristics. Moreover, Voila\nsupports over one million pre-built voices and efficient customization of new\nones from brief audio samples as short as 10 seconds. Beyond spoken dialogue,\nVoila is designed as a unified model for a wide range of voice-based\napplications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech\n(TTS), and, with minimal adaptation, multilingual speech translation.

    "abstract": "Serious illness communication (SIC) in end-of-life care faces challenges such\nas emotional stress, cultural barriers, and balancing hope with honesty.\nDespite its importance, one of the few available ways for clinicians to\npractice SIC is with standardized patients, which is expensive, time-consuming,\nand inflexible. In this paper, we present SOPHIE, an AI-powered standardized\npatient simulation and automated feedback system. SOPHIE combines large\nlanguage models (LLMs), a lifelike virtual avatar, and automated, personalized\nfeedback based on clinical literature to provide remote, on-demand SIC\ntraining. In a randomized control study with healthcare students and\nprofessionals, SOPHIE users demonstrated significant improvement across three\ncritical SIC domains: Empathize, Be Explicit, and Empower.

Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect\nor irrelevant information to suppress knowledge. Such methods effectively\nconstitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models\nvulnerable to probing. In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from\nobfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess\nwhether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information. Moreover, we\npropose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive\ndistribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using\nKL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and\ntriggering appropriate refusal behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that\nDF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level\nuncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.",

With the progression from narrow AI to\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about\ncontrol and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether\nembracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a\ndynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more\nhuman-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve\nand should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with\nwhichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single\nsystem dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that\nmisalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical\nimpossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in\nthis contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We\nintroduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and\nintervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise\nfriendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that\nopen models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in\nproprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of\nbehaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more\nsteerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems.

    "abstract": "Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes\ncollaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client\ngraphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model\nparameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately\naddress the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph\ndistributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among\nthe server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication,\nthey introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead.\nTo address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a\nnovel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new\nFGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation\ngraph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs,\nwhile minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single\ntransmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public\ndatasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over\nstate-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL\nparadigm.",

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors\non the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of\nrobustness-enhancing defense mechanisms.\n  We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across\nfive datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability\nmetrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how\ndefenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model\ntraining, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between\nrobustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open\nsource.\n  The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on\nthe chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only\nTransformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a\ndiscrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial\noutput sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due\nto the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of\nall previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As\nthis iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,\nlayer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often\nresults in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and\nreduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture\npartitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular\nintervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based\non instantaneous information about device resource availability and network\nlink bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices,\nand in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum\nof migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the\ndecoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its\nkey-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become\ntight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit\nparallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions\nin inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5\ndevices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact\noptimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable\nimprovements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art\nlayer-based partitioning approaches.",

Here, we propose a\nsub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We\nilluminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The\ntransmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back\nsurface of a 500-{\\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited\ncarriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a\nsingle-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively\nreconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625%\nunder a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To\nfurther suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular\nspectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during\npropagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object,\nenabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\\lambda}0/7\n({\\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin\nphotomodulators.

Aims: This study aims to\nunveil the current landscape of public-facing LLM deployments in the wild\nthrough a large-scale empirical study, focusing on service prevalence, exposure\ncharacteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Method: We\nconducted an Internet-wide measurement to identify public-facing LLM\ndeployments across 15 frameworks, discovering 320,102 services. We extracted\n158 unique API endpoints, grouped into 12 functional categories based on\ncapabilities and security risks. We further analyzed configurations,\nauthentication practices, and geographic distributions, revealing deployment\ntrends and systemic issues in real-world LLM system engineering. Results: Our\nstudy shows that public LLM deployments are rapidly growing but often insecure.\nAmong all endpoints, we observe widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS\nconfigurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. Security\nrisks, including model disclosure, system leakage, and unauthorized access, are\npervasive, highlighting the need for secure-by-default frameworks and stronger\ndeployment practices.

Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities,\nleading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this\nproblem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP\nChallenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose\nsolution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not\nstraightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities\ndrastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these\nambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first\nlearns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's\nsurface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation\nenables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D\ncorrespondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution\nusing PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex\nnon-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art\nsolutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from\nan RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context,\ncategorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting.\nSuperficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be\ngenuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected\nformats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the\nresults unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where\nthe model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers,\nindicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting\nnecessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial\nforgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce\nthe Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized\nprocess for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their\ntraining sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial\nforgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to\nmitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior\nknowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to\nretain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall\nmethod, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

The objective of this article is to provide\nstate-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide\nhigh-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a\ncomprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&P), as well as\na Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&P or Column Generation\n(CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates\na novel deeper integration of B&P and LNS, storing the generated columns from\nthe LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better\nglobal solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several\ncomponents of the solution methods and their impact, including general\nimprovements for the B&P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource\nConstrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The\nevaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for\ninstances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low\ngaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe\nthat B&P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight\nintegration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger\ninstances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box.

    "abstract": "Enabling a high-degree-of-freedom robot to learn specific skills is a\nchallenging task due to the complexity of robotic dynamics. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution; however, addressing such\nproblems requires the design of multiple reward functions to account for\nvarious constraints in robotic motion. Existing approaches typically sum all\nreward components indiscriminately to optimize the RL value function and\npolicy. We argue that this uniform inclusion of all reward components in policy\noptimization is inefficient and limits the robot's learning performance. To\naddress this, we propose an Automated Hybrid Reward Scheduling (AHRS) framework\nbased on Large Language Models (LLMs). This paradigm dynamically adjusts the\nlearning intensity of each reward component throughout the policy optimization\nprocess, enabling robots to acquire skills in a gradual and structured manner.\nSpecifically, we design a multi-branch value network, where each branch\ncorresponds to a distinct reward component. During policy optimization, each\nbranch is assigned a weight that reflects its importance, and these weights are\nautomatically computed based on rules designed by LLMs. The LLM generates a\nrule set in advance, derived from the task description, and during training, it\nselects a weight calculation rule from the library based on language prompts\nthat evaluate the performance of each branch. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the AHRS method achieves an average 6.48% performance improvement across\nmultiple high-degree-of-freedom robotic tasks.",

Current approaches often rely on manual tuning or\nexhaustive search, which are computationally expensive without any guarantee of\nconverging to optimal results. We propose a sequential forward search algorithm\nthat incrementally activates and evaluates candidate fusion modules at\ndifferent layers of a multimodal network. At each step, the algorithm retrains\nfrom previously learned weights and compares validation loss to identify the\nbest-performing configuration. This process systematically reduces the search\nspace, enabling efficient identification of the optimal fusion timing without\nexhaustively testing all possible module placements. The approach is validated\non two multimodal MRI datasets, each addressing different classification tasks.\nOur algorithm consistently identified configurations that outperformed unimodal\nbaselines, late fusion, and a brute-force ensemble of all potential fusion\nplacements. These architectures demonstrated superior accuracy, F-score, and\nspecificity while maintaining competitive or improved AUC values. Furthermore,\nthe sequential nature of the search significantly reduced computational\noverhead, making the optimization process more practical. By systematically\ndetermining the optimal timing to fuse imaging modalities, our method advances\nmultimodal deep learning for medical imaging.

Within a fixed 50 billion token training\nbudget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1\nby +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing\nthe baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting\nSwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies\nconfirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting\ndelivering the largest gains.

    "abstract": "Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address\nchallenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of\nmultimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have\nachieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data)\ngeneration, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages.\nExisting approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic\nexploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often\ndomain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to\ngenerate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to\nreal-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions\ninto three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000\nhigh-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series\n(T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural\nlanguage and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a\nlength-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying\nlengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively\naligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow\nMatching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in\nan interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate\nsequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.",

Recent efforts attempt to improve editing\nmodels through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on\nrecognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to\nresolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by\nconstructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This\nincludes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the\noriginal-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to\nfurther enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models\nexhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps,\nindependent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified\nguide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some\nchallenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified\ninstructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals\nwith positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model\ntraining using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision\neffectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training\ntasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to\nprovide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and\neffective solution for instruction-based image editing.

Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation\ndistribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the\nhigh-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic\nrepresentation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the\nexisting works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause\ninsufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training\nobjective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation\ntensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive\nlearning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to\nimpose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen\nthe alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning.

In\nresponse, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble\nmodels to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality\nof CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new\n\\textbf{J}oint \\textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and\n\\textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \\textbf{S}entence\n\\textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven\nsemantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show\nthat JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model\noutperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we\nhave conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows\nthat JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.",

This study investigates the\neffectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam\ndetection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information\nfrom email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework,\nthe proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam\ndetection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam\ndetection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining,\nmaking it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training is a cornerstone of robust deep learning, but fast\nmethods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) often suffer from\nCatastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models become robust to single-step\nattacks but fail against multi-step variants. While existing solutions rely on\nnoise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel\nsolution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO.\n  Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent\nunder the $l^{\\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we\ndevelop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and\ncraft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to\n$l^{\\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly\nconcentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact\nwith aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through\nParticipation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM\nthat automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness\nwithout requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a\nnovel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.",

However, these TPR-based\nthresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in\nhigh FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring\nfunctions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed,\nevolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \\emph{safely updates\nboth scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD\ninputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times,\neven as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR\ncontrol under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations\non OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing\nmethods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.",

    "abstract": "Industry is rapidly moving towards fully autonomous and interconnected\nsystems that can detect and adapt to changing conditions, including machine\nhardware faults. Traditional methods for adding hardware fault tolerance to\nmachines involve duplicating components and algorithmically reconfiguring a\nmachine's processes when a fault occurs. However, the growing interest in\nreinforcement learning-based robotic control offers a new perspective on\nachieving hardware fault tolerance. However, limited research has explored the\npotential of these approaches for hardware fault tolerance in machines. This\npaper investigates the potential of two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), to\nenhance hardware fault tolerance into machines. We assess the performance of\nthese algorithms in two OpenAI Gym simulated environments, Ant-v2 and\nFetchReach-v1. Robot models in these environments are subjected to six\nsimulated hardware faults. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to\ndetermine the optimal method for transferring an agent's knowledge, acquired\nthrough learning in a normal (pre-fault) environment, to a (post-)fault\nenvironment in a continual learning setting. Our results demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning-based approaches can enhance hardware fault tolerance in\nsimulated machines, with adaptation occurring within minutes. Specifically, PPO\nexhibits the fastest adaptation when retaining the knowledge within its models,\nwhile SAC performs best when discarding all acquired knowledge. Overall, this\nstudy highlights the potential of reinforcement learning-based approaches, such\nas PPO and SAC, for hardware fault tolerance in machines. These findings pave\nthe way for the development of robust and adaptive machines capable of\neffectively operating in real-world scenarios.",

However, these solutions might lead to the loss or redundancy of\nsemantic subgraphs and result in suboptimal generalization. To address this\nchallenge, we propose exploiting Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS)\nto extract sufficient and necessary invariant substructures. Beyond that, we\nfurther leverage the domain variant subgraphs related to the labels to boost\nthe generalization performance in an ensemble manner. Specifically, we first\nconsider the data generation process for graph data. Under mild conditions, we\nshow that the sufficient and necessary invariant subgraph can be extracted by\nminimizing an upper bound, built on the theoretical advance of the probability\nof necessity and sufficiency. To further bridge the theory and algorithm, we\ndevise the model called Sufficiency and Necessity Inspired Graph Learning\n(SNIGL), which ensembles an invariant subgraph classifier on top of latent\nsufficient and necessary invariant subgraphs, and a domain variant subgraph\nclassifier specific to the test domain for generalization enhancement.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our SNIGL model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art techniques on six public benchmarks, highlighting its\neffectiveness in real-world scenarios.",

Due to the interleaving\nof cooperation and competition, understanding agents' decision-making in such\nenvironments is challenging, and humans can benefit from obtaining\nexplanations. However, such environments and scenarios have rarely been\nexplored in the context of explainable AI. While some explanation methods for\ncooperative environments can be applied in mixed-motive setups, they do not\naddress inter-agent competition, cheap-talk, or implicit communication by\nactions.

One example of such a tool is a pair of micro-surgical\nscissors that was developed for cutting of tumors or cancerous tissues present\ndeep inside the body such as in the brain. This task is often deemed difficult\nor impossible with conventional robotic tools due to their size and dexterity.\nThe scissors are designed with two magnets placed a specific distance apart to\nmaximize deflection and generate cutting forces. However, remote actuation and\nsize requirements of the micro-surgical scissors limits the force that can be\ngenerated to puncture the tissue. To address the limitation of small output\nforces, we use an evolutionary algorithm to further optimize the performance of\nthe scissors. In this study, the design of the previously developed untethered\nmicro-surgical scissors has been modified and their performance is enhanced by\ndetermining the optimal position of the magnets as well as the direction of\neach magnetic moment. The developed algorithm is successfully applied to a\n4-magnet configuration which results in increased net torque. This improvement\nin net torque is directly translated into higher cutting forces. The new\nconfiguration generates a cutting force of 58 mN from 80 generations of the\nevolutionary algorithm which is a 1.65 times improvement from the original\ndesign.

In this paper, we present a novel energy-based\ngenerative framework, Variational Potential Flow (VAPO), that entirely\ndispenses with implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on complementary latent\nmodels or cooperative training. The VAPO framework aims to learn a potential\nenergy function whose gradient (flow) guides the prior samples, so that their\ndensity evolution closely follows an approximate data likelihood homotopy. An\nenergy loss function is then formulated to minimize the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence between density evolution of the flow-driven prior and the data\nlikelihood homotopy. Images can be generated after training the potential\nenergy, by initializing the samples from Gaussian prior and solving the ODE\ngoverning the potential flow on a fixed time interval using generic ODE\nsolvers. Experiment results show that the proposed VAPO framework is capable of\ngenerating realistic images on various image datasets. In particular, our\nproposed framework achieves competitive FID scores for unconditional image\ngeneration on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets.",

When an\nimage jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of\nVLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits\nlittle-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether\nthe attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language\nmodels, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or\nsafety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display\npartially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and\nidentically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and\nbetween different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these\nresults, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved\nagainst a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of\n``highly-similar\" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing\nevidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models\nand transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that\nVLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.",

The key idea behind Im2Flow2Act is to use object flow as the\nmanipulation interface, bridging domain gaps between different embodiments\n(i.e., human and robot) and training environments (i.e., real-world and\nsimulated). Im2Flow2Act comprises two components: a flow generation network and\na flow-conditioned policy. The flow generation network, trained on human\ndemonstration videos, generates object flow from the initial scene image,\nconditioned on the task description. The flow-conditioned policy, trained on\nsimulated robot play data, maps the generated object flow to robot actions to\nrealize the desired object movements. By using flow as input, this policy can\nbe directly deployed in the real world with a minimal sim-to-real gap. By\nleveraging real-world human videos and simulated robot play data, we bypass the\nchallenges of teleoperating physical robots in the real world, resulting in a\nscalable system for diverse tasks. We demonstrate Im2Flow2Act's capabilities in\na variety of real-world tasks, including the manipulation of rigid,\narticulated, and deformable objects.",

This method executes in\nthe inference phase and can efficiently boost the DTA prediction performance\nwith no training cost. In addition, we propose an extension, Ada-$k$NN-DTA, an\ninstance-wise and adaptive aggregation with lightweight learning. Results on\nfour benchmark datasets show that $k$NN-DTA brings significant improvements,\noutperforming previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, e.g, on BindingDB\nIC$_{50}$ and $K_i$ testbeds, $k$NN-DTA obtains new records of RMSE\n$\\bf{0.684}$ and $\\bf{0.750}$.

They indirectly influence people's\ndecisions or opinions through their daily use. Therefore, understanding how and\nwhich moral judgements these LLMs make is crucial. However, morality is not\nuniversal and depends on the cultural background. This raises the question of\nwhether these cultural preferences are also reflected in LLMs when prompted in\ndifferent languages or whether moral decision-making is consistent across\ndifferent languages. So far, most research has focused on investigating the\ninherent values of LLMs in English. While a few works conduct multilingual\nanalyses of moral bias in LLMs in a multilingual setting, these analyses do not\ngo beyond atomic actions. To the best of our knowledge, a multilingual analysis\nof moral bias in dilemmas has not yet been conducted.\n  To address this, our paper builds on the moral machine experiment (MME) to\ninvestigate the moral preferences of five LLMs, Falcon, Gemini, Llama, GPT, and\nMPT, in a multilingual setting and compares them with the preferences collected\nfrom humans belonging to different cultures. To accomplish this, we generate\n6500 scenarios of the MME and prompt the models in ten languages on which\naction to take. Our analysis reveals that all LLMs inhibit different moral\nbiases to some degree and that they not only differ from the human preferences\nbut also across multiple languages within the models themselves. Moreover, we\nfind that almost all models, particularly Llama 3, divert greatly from human\nvalues and, for instance, prefer saving fewer people over saving more.",

However, in time series data, traditional ADA approaches often fail to\naddress distribution shifts related to temporal characteristics. To address\nthis limitation, we propose Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation (TADA) for\ntime series data, which incorporate time warping into ADA. Although time\nwarping is inherently non-differentiable, ADA relies on generating samples\nthrough backpropagation.

Our evaluations across\nvarious time series datasets demonstrate that TADA outperforms existing methods\nfor domain generalization.

However, this\ncould hinder the extraction of basic visual features in long-term training,\nthus restricting performance improvement. To mitigate this issue, we propose a\nnovel method named DBF (Dynamic Backbone Freezing) for feature backbone\nfine-tuning on remote sensing object detection. Our method aims to handle the\ndilemma of whether the backbone should extract low-level generic features or\npossess specific knowledge of the remote sensing domain, by introducing a\nmodule called 'Freezing Scheduler' to dynamically manage the update of backbone\nfeatures during training. Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R show that\nour approach enables more accurate model learning while substantially reducing\ncomputational costs. Our method can be seamlessly adopted without additional\neffort due to its straightforward design.",

Traditional computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP)\ntools fail to find suitable RCs due to data sparsity and inadequate reaction\nrepresentations.

    "abstract": "Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic effects\nbut often require additional encoding modules, a large number of training\nparameters, and complex preprocessing, which increases the burden on training\nand inference. In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules\nand analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in\nthe inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple\nand efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn\ngarments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them\nalong spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of\nCatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON\nconsists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant\nimage and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M\nparameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we\nidentify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion\nmodels to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only\n49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates\nunnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and\ncaptioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the\nvirtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other\ndiffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON\nachieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline\nmethods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild\nscenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce DOPRA, a novel approach designed to mitigate\nhallucinations in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike existing\nsolutions that typically involve costly supplementary training data or the\nintegration of external knowledge sources, DOPRA innovatively addresses\nhallucinations by decoding specific weighted layer penalties and\nredistribution, offering an economical and effective solution without\nadditional resources. DOPRA is grounded in unique insights into the intrinsic\nmechanisms controlling hallucinations within MLLMs, especially the models'\ntendency to over-rely on a subset of summary tokens in the self-attention\nmatrix, neglecting critical image-related information. This phenomenon is\nparticularly pronounced in certain strata. To counteract this over-reliance,\nDOPRA employs a strategy of weighted overlay penalties and redistribution in\nspecific layers, such as the 12th layer, during the decoding process.\nFurthermore, DOPRA includes a retrospective allocation process that re-examines\nthe sequence of generated tokens, allowing the algorithm to reallocate token\nselection to better align with the actual image content, thereby reducing the\nincidence of hallucinatory descriptions in auto-generated captions. Overall,\nDOPRA represents a significant step forward in improving the output quality of\nMLLMs by systematically reducing hallucinations through targeted adjustments\nduring the decoding process.",

To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Agent Causal Discovery\nFramework (MAC), which consists of two key modules: the Debate-Coding Module\n(DCM) and the Meta-Debate Module (MDM). The DCM begins with a multi-agent\ndebating and coding process, where agents use both structured data and metadata\nto collaboratively select the most suitable statistical causal discovery (SCD)\nmethod. The selected SCD is then applied to the structured data to generate an\ninitial causal graph. This causal graph is transformed into causal metadata\nthrough the Meta Fusion mechanism. With all the metadata, MDM then refines the\ncausal structure by leveraging a multi-agent debating framework. Extensive\nexperiments across five datasets demonstrate that MAC outperforms both\ntraditional statistical causal discovery methods and existing LLM-based\napproaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend and enhance the perceptual\nabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite offering new possibilities\nfor LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical\nconcerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs\nhave undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming\nframeworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically\nfor VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of\nvisual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning\nexisting red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an\nautomated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are\nproduced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM\nguided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of\nVLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward\nmetrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in\ncreating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our\nevaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security\nvulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning\nmulti-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack\nsuccess rate of 84.5\\% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by\nOpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also\ncategorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding\nreinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code\nwill be released after ethics committee approval. CONTENT WARNING: THIS PAPER\nCONTAINS HARMFUL MODEL RESPONSES.",

    "abstract": "The application of large-scale models in medical image segmentation demands\nsubstantial quantities of meticulously annotated data curated by experts along\nwith high computational resources, both of which are challenges in\nresource-poor settings. In this study, we present the Medical Segment Anything\nModel with Galore MedSAGa where we adopt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to\nachieve memory-efficient, few-shot medical image segmentation by applying\nGradient Low-Rank Projection GaLore to the parameters of the image encoder of\nSAM. Meanwhile, the weights of the prompt encoder and mask decoder undergo full\nparameter fine-tuning using standard optimizers. We further assess MedSAGa's\nfew-shot learning capabilities, reporting on its memory efficiency and\nsegmentation performance across multiple standard medical image segmentation\ndatasets. We compare it with several baseline models, including LoRA fine-tuned\nSAM (SAMed) and DAE-Former. Experiments across multiple datasets and these\nbaseline models with different number of images for fine tuning demonstrated\nthat the GPU memory consumption of MedSAGa is significantly less than that of\nthe baseline models, achieving an average memory efficiency of 66% more than\ncurrent state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for medical image segmentation. The\ncombination of substantially lower memory requirements and comparable to SOTA\nresults in few-shot learning for medical image segmentation positions MedSAGa\nas an optimal solution for deployment in resource-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel geometry-aware self-training framework\nfor room layout estimation models on unseen scenes with unlabeled data. Our\napproach utilizes a ray-casting formulation to aggregate multiple estimates\nfrom different viewing positions, enabling the computation of reliable\npseudo-labels for self-training. In particular, our ray-casting approach\nenforces multi-view consistency along all ray directions and prioritizes\nspatial proximity to the camera view for geometry reasoning. As a result, our\ngeometry-aware pseudo-labels effectively handle complex room geometries and\noccluded walls without relying on assumptions such as Manhattan World or planar\nroom walls. Evaluation on publicly available datasets, including synthetic and\nreal-world scenarios, demonstrates significant improvements in current\nstate-of-the-art layout models without using any human annotation.",

    "abstract": "Partial-Label Learning (PLL) is a typical problem of weakly supervised\nlearning, where each training instance is annotated with a set of candidate\nlabels. Self-training PLL models achieve state-of-the-art performance but\nsuffer from error accumulation problem caused by mistakenly disambiguated\ninstances. Although co-training can alleviate this issue by training two\nnetworks simultaneously and allowing them to interact with each other, most\nexisting co-training methods train two structurally identical networks with the\nsame task, i.e., are symmetric, rendering it insufficient for them to correct\neach other due to their similar limitations. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose an asymmetric dual-task co-training PLL model called AsyCo, which\nforces its two networks, i.e., a disambiguation network and an auxiliary\nnetwork, to learn from different views explicitly by optimizing distinct tasks.\nSpecifically, the disambiguation network is trained with self-training PLL task\nto learn label confidence, while the auxiliary network is trained in a\nsupervised learning paradigm to learn from the noisy pairwise similarity labels\nthat are constructed according to the learned label confidence. Finally, the\nerror accumulation problem is mitigated via information distillation and\nconfidence refinement. Extensive experiments on both uniform and\ninstance-dependent partially labeled datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nAsyCo. The code is available at https://github.com/libeibeics/AsyCo.",

    "abstract": "Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is a key competence of performant\ntransformer language models that is tested by mainstream benchmarks. However,\nrecent evidence shows that models can have quite a range of performance,\nparticularly when the task format is diversified slightly (such as by shuffling\nanswer choice order). In this work we ask: how do successful models perform\nformatted MCQA? We employ vocabulary projection and activation patching methods\nto localize key hidden states that encode relevant information for predicting\nthe correct answer. We find that the prediction of a specific answer symbol is\ncausally attributed to a few middle layers, and specifically their multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms. We show that subsequent layers increase the\nprobability of the predicted answer symbol in vocabulary space, and that this\nprobability increase is associated with a sparse set of attention heads with\nunique roles. We additionally uncover differences in how different models\nadjust to alternative symbols. Finally, we demonstrate that a synthetic task\ncan disentangle sources of model error to pinpoint when a model has learned\nformatted MCQA, and show that logit differences between answer choice tokens\ncontinue to grow over the course of training.",

    "abstract": "This review provides an in-depth exploration of the field of animal action recognition, focusing on coarse-grained (CG) and fine-grained (FG) techniques. The primary aim is to examine the current state of research in animal behaviour recognition and to elucidate the unique challenges associated with recognising subtle animal actions in outdoor environments. These challenges differ significantly from those encountered in human action recognition due to factors such as non-rigid body structures, frequent occlusions, and the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets. The review begins by discussing the evolution of human action recognition, a more established field, highlighting how it progressed from broad, coarse actions in controlled settings to the demand for fine-grained recognition in dynamic environments. This shift is particularly relevant for animal action recognition, where behavioural variability and environmental complexity present unique challenges that human-centric models cannot fully address. The review then underscores the critical differences between human and animal action recognition, with an emphasis on high intra-species variability, unstructured datasets, and the natural complexity of animal habitats. Techniques like spatio-temporal deep learning frameworks (e.g., SlowFast) are evaluated for their effectiveness in animal behaviour analysis, along with the limitations of existing datasets. By assessing the strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies and introducing a recently-published dataset, the review outlines future directions for advancing fine-grained action recognition, aiming to improve accuracy and generalisability in behaviour analysis across species.",

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their cross-model adaptability.",

While recent advancements in data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization. We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial conditions.",

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints. Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards. All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation. Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.",

    "abstract": "We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs) with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and one or more RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA unprojects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at https://og-vla.github.io/",

    "abstract": "The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an additional network that generates the weights of the primary network dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in enabling continual learning for improved performance.",

To address model misspecification, we propose a doubly robust preference optimization algorithm that remains consistent when either the preference model or the reference policy is correctly specified (without requiring both).

We train two types of generative models, Masked Transformers and Flow-Matching, on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations. Additionally, we explore architectural variants with different attention mechanisms and parameter-sharing strategies. Our parameter-sharing techniques reduce model size by 33-53% with minimal impact on performance or visual fidelity.

We introduce GraphPad, a modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a +3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more informative representations without extra training or data collection.",

However, such modern generative models suffer from expensive inference, inhibiting their use in numerous scientific applications like Boltzmann Generators (BGs) for molecular conformations that require fast likelihood evaluation. In this paper, we revisit classical normalizing flows in the context of BGs that offer efficient sampling and likelihoods, but whose training via maximum likelihood is often unstable and computationally challenging. We propose Regression Training of Normalizing Flows (RegFlow), a novel and scalable regression-based training objective that bypasses the numerical instability and computational challenge of conventional maximum likelihood training in favour of a simple $\\ell_2$-regression objective. Specifically, RegFlow maps prior samples under our flow to targets computed using optimal transport couplings or a pre-trained continuous normalizing flow (CNF). To enhance numerical stability, RegFlow employs effective regularization strategies such as a new forward-backward self-consistency loss that enjoys painless implementation. Empirically, we demonstrate that RegFlow unlocks a broader class of architectures that were previously intractable to train for BGs with maximum likelihood. We also show RegFlow exceeds the performance, computational cost, and stability of maximum likelihood training in equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide, tripeptide, and tetrapeptide, showcasing its potential in molecular systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language (DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To address this challenge, we propose $\\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel $\\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time, significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that Formatron not only $\\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant outputs but also achieves $\\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly, Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities: Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities. For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the community.",

To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various scenarios due to their exceptional reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding. While LLMs demonstrate strong performance in tasks involving mathematics and coding, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when applied to chemistry-related problems. Chemistry problems typically involve long and complex reasoning steps, which contain specific terminology, including specialized symbol systems and complex nomenclature conventions. These characteristics often cause general LLMs to experience hallucinations during the reasoning process due to their lack of specific knowledge. However, existing methods are struggling to effectively leverage chemical expertise and formulas. Moreover, current uncertainty estimation methods, designed to mitigate potential reasoning errors, are unable to precisely identify specific steps or key knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ChemAU, which incorporates our adaptive uncertainty estimation method that applies different uncertainty values based on the position of reasoning steps within the whole reasoning chain. Leveraging this method, ChemAU identifies gaps in chemistry knowledge and precisely supplements chemical expertise with the specialized domain model, thereby correcting and updating the previously flawed reasoning chain. Our experiments with three popular LLMs across three chemistry datasets demonstrate that ChemAU significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and uncertainty estimation.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos, they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy.

    "abstract": "High-quality, large-scale audio captioning is crucial for advancing audio understanding, yet current automated methods often generate captions that lack fine-grained detail and contextual accuracy, primarily due to their reliance on limited unimodal or superficial multimodal information. Drawing inspiration from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2) FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with superior audio-text alignment and instruction following.

Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.7% recall on Pfuji-Size_Orch2018 orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.",

In this work, we propose two modifications to this algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i) Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter $m$ from $Ω(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a, counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature. However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3 \\log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \\log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.",

However, in environments with sparse rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories, leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy reinforcement learning methods. We introduce SuperRL, a unified training framework that adaptively alternates between RL and SFT. Whenever every rollout for a given instance receives zero reward, indicating the absence of a learning signal, SuperRL falls back to SFT on the curated offline data. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL surpasses vanilla RL by delivering higher sample efficiency, stronger generalization, and improved robustness under sparse rewards.",

We propose the Modular Speaker Architecture (MSA), a framework that decomposes speaker behavior into modular components for role tracking, responsibility continuity, and contextual coherence. Grounded in high-context human-AI dialogues, MSA includes three core modules: a Speaker Role Module, a Responsibility Chain Tracker, and a Contextual Integrity Validator. We evaluate MSA through annotated case studies and introduce structural metrics-pragmatic consistency, responsibility flow, and context stability-quantified via manual and automatic scoring and bootstrapped statistical analysis. Our results show that MSA reliably maintains interaction structure without reliance on affective signals or surface-level heuristics. We further implement a prototype configuration language (G-Code) and modular API to support MSA deployment in dynamic multi-agent scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The rule $\\mathrm{Defeated}(x) \\leftarrow \\mathrm{Attacks}(y,x),\\, \\neg \\, \\mathrm{Defeated}(y)$, evaluated under the well-founded semantics (WFS), yields a unique 3-valued (skeptical) solution of an abstract argumentation framework (AF). An argument $x$ is defeated ($\\mathrm{OUT}$) if there exists an undefeated argument $y$ that attacks it. For 2-valued (stable) solutions, this is the case iff $y$ is accepted ($\\mathrm{IN}$), i.e., if all of $y$'s attackers are defeated. Under WFS, arguments that are neither accepted nor defeated are undecided ($\\mathrm{UNDEC}$). As shown in prior work, well-founded solutions (a.k.a. grounded labelings) \"explain themselves\": The provenance of arguments is given by subgraphs (definable via regular path queries) rooted at the node of interest. This provenance is closely related to winning strategies of a two-player argumentation game.\n  We present a novel approach for extending this provenance to stable AF solutions. Unlike grounded solutions, which can be constructed via a bottom-up alternating fixpoint procedure, stable models often involve non-deterministic choice as part of the search for models. Thus, the provenance of stable solutions is of a different nature, and reflects a more expressive generate & test paradigm. Our approach identifies minimal sets of critical attacks, pinpointing choices and assumptions made by a stable model. These critical attack edges provide additional insights into the provenance of an argument's status, combining well-founded derivation steps with choice steps. Our approach can be understood as a form of diagnosis that finds minimal \"repairs\" to an AF graph such that the well-founded solution of the repaired graph coincides with the desired stable model of the original AF graph.",

We propose PRioritized cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data- and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned. Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress, prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods, PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a scalable solution for efficient learning.",

While conventional biometrics systems such as DNA profiling and iris scanning offer high accuracy, they are time-consuming and costly. Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood group classification to explore potential correlations between these two traits. Methods: The study analyzed 200 individuals, categorizing their fingerprints into three types: loops, whorls, and arches. Blood group classification was also recorded. Statistical analysis, including chi-square and Pearson correlation tests, was used to assess associations between fingerprint patterns and blood groups. Results: Loops were the most common fingerprint pattern, while blood group O+ was the most prevalent among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between fingerprint patterns and blood groups (p > 0.05), suggesting that these traits are independent. Conclusions: Although the study showed limited correlation between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood groups, it highlights the importance of future research using larger and more diverse populations, incorporating machine learning approaches, and integrating multiple biometric signals. This study contributes to forensic science by emphasizing the need for rigorous protocols and comprehensive investigations in personal identification.",

    "abstract": "Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem, especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general, as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "This position paper states that AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) should be considered a dynamic and interaction-dependent process that heavily depends on the social environment where agents are deployed, either collaborative, cooperative, or competitive. While AI alignment with human values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts before such dynamics grow too complex to control.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding and enumerating polyominos that can be folded into multiple non-isomorphic boxes. While several computational approaches have been proposed, including SAT, randomized algorithms, and decision diagrams, none has been able to perform at scale. We argue that existing SAT encodings are hindered by the presence of global constraints (e.g., graph connectivity or acyclicity), which are generally hard to encode effectively and hard for solvers to reason about. In this work, we propose a new SAT-based approach that replaces these global constraints with simple local constraints that have substantially better propagation properties. Our approach dramatically improves the scalability of both computing and enumerating common box unfoldings: (i) while previous approaches could only find common unfoldings of two boxes up to area 88, ours easily scales beyond 150, and (ii) while previous approaches were only able to enumerate common unfoldings up to area 30, ours scales up to 60. This allows us to rule out 46, 54, and 58 as the smallest areas allowing a common unfolding of three boxes, thereby refuting a conjecture of Xu et al. (2017).",

    "abstract": "Despite notable advancements in multimodal reasoning, leading Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still underperform on vision-centric multimodal reasoning tasks in general scenarios. This shortfall stems from their predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies, while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to counterpart advanced reasoning models. The code, model, and data will be released soon at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/GThinker.",

    "abstract": "Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests, including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples, and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification, highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal identification.",

However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive ``fighting fire with fire'' strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities.

    "abstract": "We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in \"needle-in-a-haystack\" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the \"lost-in-the-middle\" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.",

In the absence of ground truth or in-depth knowledge about the inner workings of the model, it is often difficult to meaningfully determine which of the different FA methods produce more suitable explanations in different contexts. As a step towards addressing this issue, we introduce the open-source XAI-Units benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate FA methods against diverse types of model behaviours, such as feature interactions, cancellations, and discontinuous outputs. Our benchmark provides a set of paired datasets and models with known internal mechanisms, establishing clear expectations for desirable attribution scores. Accompanied by a suite of built-in evaluation metrics, XAI-Units streamlines systematic experimentation and reveals how FA methods perform against distinct, atomic kinds of model reasoning, similar to unit tests in software engineering. Crucially, by using procedurally generated models tied to synthetic datasets, we pave the way towards an objective and reliable comparison of FA methods.",

We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains alike.",

We introduce MCP-Zero, an active agent framework that restores tool discovery autonomy to LLMs themselves. Instead of overwhelming models with all available tools, MCP-Zero enables agents to actively identify capability gaps, and request specific tools on-demand, transforming them from large-scale retrievers into genuine autonomous agents. The framework operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Active Tool Request, where models autonomously generate structured requests specifying their exact tool requirements; (2) Hierarchical Semantic Routing, a two-stage algorithm that matches requests to relevant servers and tools through improved semantic alignment; (3) Iterative Capability Extension, enabling agents to progressively build cross-domain toolchains while maintaining minimal context footprint. We construct MCP-tools, a comprehensive dataset of 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository. Experiments demonstrate that MCP-Zero preserves agent autonomy while achieving substantial efficiency gains: (i) accurate tool selection from nearly 3k candidates across 248.1k tokens; (ii) 98\\% reduction in token consumption on APIBank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) consistent multi-turn performance that scales with tool ecosystem growth.

This work introduces Scaling with Gradient Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust choice for LLM optimization.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM. Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights, such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20 LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural activations to interpretable semantics. However, the complex mechanisms that link neuron's functional co-activation with the emergent model capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By probing models across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology, which persists even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections. Strikingly, probing on topology outperforms probing on activation by up to 130.4%, suggesting that neural topology contains orders of richer information of LLM performance than neural activation, which can be easily extracted with simple linear or MLP probes. To explain the dependence between neural topology and language performance, we identify default networks and hub neurons in LLMs and provide causal evidence by interventional experiments on multiple benchmarks, showing that LLMs actually exploit these topological information. Further analyses suggest that neural topology can be effectively leveraged to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of LLMs through proof-of-concept applications in model pruning, hallucination detection, and LLM fingerprinting.

    "abstract": "Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.",

To further improve the model performance, we decouple deep filtering into temporal and frequency components and introduce a two-stage framework, reducing the complexity of filter coefficient prediction at each stage. Additionally, we propose the TAConv module to strengthen convolutional feature extraction.

Predicted intents are integrated into large language models via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans.

    "abstract": "We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model (LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents -- business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query, steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic, protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.",

We evaluate model's performance using SSIM, LPIPS, and a proposed metric, \\metricnameabbr, which quantifies semantic alignment between reference and output. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms both training-free and trained baselines, achieving superior semantic mixing and temporal coherence without retraining.

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces must ensure that User Equipment units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other units being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining both an efficient and fair duplex Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Reinforcement Learning system for multiple legitimate User Equipment units without reducing the level of achieved physical-layer security hardening. In terms of contributions, we uncover a fairness imbalance of a previous physical-layer security hardening solution, validate our findings and report experimental work via simulation results.

    "abstract": "The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet. Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new parameters.",

    "abstract": "Detecting social media bots is essential for maintaining the security and trustworthiness of social networks. While contemporary graph-based detection methods demonstrate promising results, their practical application is limited by label reliance and poor generalization capability across diverse communities. Generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSL) presents a promising paradigm to overcome these limitations, yet existing approaches predominantly follow the homophily assumption and fail to capture the global patterns in the graph, which potentially diminishes their effectiveness when facing the challenges of interaction camouflage and distributed deployment in bot detection scenarios. To this end, we propose BotHP, a generative GSL framework tailored to boost graph-based bot detectors through heterophily-aware representation learning and prototype-guided cluster discovery. Specifically, BotHP leverages a dual-encoder architecture, consisting of a graph-aware encoder to capture node commonality and a graph-agnostic encoder to preserve node uniqueness. This enables the simultaneous modeling of both homophily and heterophily, effectively countering the interaction camouflage issue. Additionally, BotHP incorporates a prototype-guided cluster discovery pretext task to model the latent global consistency of bot clusters and identify spatially dispersed yet semantically aligned bot collectives. Extensive experiments on two real-world bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotHP consistently boosts graph-based bot detectors, improving detection performance, alleviating label reliance, and enhancing generalization capability.",

However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data.

However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.",

Current detection methods face two major limitations: (1) the lack of multidimensional explainable datasets for generated images and videos. Existing open-source datasets (e.g., WildFake, GenVideo) rely on oversimplified binary annotations, which restrict the explainability and trustworthiness of trained detectors. (2) Prior MLLM-based forgery detectors (e.g., FakeVLM) exhibit insufficiently fine-grained interpretability in their step-by-step reasoning, which hinders reliable localization and explanation. To address these challenges, we introduce Ivy-Fake, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark for explainable AIGC detection. It consists of over 106K richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 5,000 manually verified evaluation examples, sourced from multiple generative models and real world datasets through a carefully designed pipeline to ensure both diversity and quality. Furthermore, we propose Ivy-xDetector, a reinforcement learning model based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), capable of producing explainable reasoning chains and achieving robust performance across multiple synthetic content detection benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our dataset and confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our method improves performance on GenImage from 86.88% to 96.32%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.",

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional algorithms, which are typically designed to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic diversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues, including unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across different domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a nuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the development of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we present a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a paradigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity throughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to model evaluation and deployment. By applying this approach to a variety of critical fields, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and recommendation systems, we demonstrate the substantial benefits and potential of heterogeneity-aware ML. These applications underscore how a deeper understanding of data diversity can enhance model robustness, fairness, and reliability and help model diagnosis and improvements. Moreover, we delve into future directions and provide research opportunities for the whole data mining community, aiming to promote the development of heterogeneity-aware ML.",

    "abstract": "Mainstream Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approaches have employed BERT to extract semantics from both context and definitions of senses to determine the most suitable sense of a target word, achieving notable performance. However, there are two limitations in these approaches. First, previous studies failed to balance the representation of token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics during feature extraction, leading to insufficient semantic representation and a performance bottleneck. Second, these approaches incorporated all possible senses of each target word during the training phase, leading to unnecessary computational costs. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a poly-encoder BERT-based model with batch contrastive learning for WSD, named PolyBERT. Compared with previous WSD methods, PolyBERT has two improvements: (1) A poly-encoder with a multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to fuse token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics, rather than focusing on just one. This approach enriches semantic representation by balancing local and global semantics. (2) To avoid redundant training inputs, Batch Contrastive Learning (BCL) is introduced. BCL utilizes the correct senses of other target words in the same batch as negative samples for the current target word, which reduces training inputs and computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyBERT outperforms baseline WSD methods such as Huang's GlossBERT and Blevins's BEM by 2\\% in F1-score. In addition, PolyBERT with BCL reduces GPU hours by 37.6\\% compared with PolyBERT without BCL.",

    "abstract": "Federated instruction tuning of large language models (LLMs) is challenged by significant data heterogeneity across clients, demanding robust personalization. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, where experts can specialize in distinct data patterns, presents a natural architectural solution to this challenge. The inherent sparsity of the MoE architecture, achieved by selectively activating experts, poses a significant challenge to its integration with federated learning (FL). Conventional FL frameworks, designed for dense models, naively aggregate all expert parameters irrespective of their local activation patterns. This naive approach not only undermines MoE's dynamic sparsity but also risks corrupting the world knowledge within pretrained experts. To address this, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel framework that leverages pretrained MoE-based LLMs for efficient personalization. By aggregating only the shared non-expert parameters, FLEx significantly reduces communication overhead and preserves the world knowledge stored within the frozen pretrained experts. For personalization, we introduce a novel expert grafting mechanism that leverages dynamic sparsity to construct a client-specific expert from selected components of pretrained experts, tailored to local data. This grafted expert is then fine-tuned locally alongside the gating mechanism. This joint training enables the model to learn when to leverage the shared knowledge from frozen experts and when to employ the personalized one. Evaluations on diverse, non-IID instruction tuning datasets show that FLEx consistently outperforms federated baselines on average, while demonstrating strong knowledge preservation on the knowledge-driven benchmark MMLU.

We explore expected timelines for AI replacing programmers, identify perceived barriers to deployment, and examine beliefs about responsibility when agents make critical decisions. Key findings reveal three distinct clusters of respondents. While the study explored factors associated with current AI agent deployment, the initial logistic regression model did not yield statistically significant predictors, suggesting that deployment decisions are complex and may be influenced by factors not fully captured or that a larger sample is needed.

Existing approaches such as formal specification, verification, and model-based development require expertise in both legal and software development domains, as well as extensive manual effort. Given the recent advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, we investigate their ability to generate legally compliant smart contracts directly from natural language legal contracts, addressing these challenges. We propose a novel suite of metrics to quantify legal compliance based on modeling both legal and smart contracts as processes and comparing their behaviors. We select four LLMs, generate 20 smart contracts based on five legal contracts, and analyze their legal compliance. We find that while all LLMs generate syntactically correct code, there is significant variance in their legal compliance with larger models generally showing higher levels of compliance. We also evaluate the proposed metrics against properties of software metrics, showing they provide fine-grained distinctions, enable nuanced comparisons, and are applicable across domains for code from any source, LLM or developer. Our results suggest that LLMs can assist in generating starter code for legally compliant smart contracts with strict reviews, and the proposed metrics provide a foundation for automated and self-improving development workflows.",

However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.

Despite recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and (2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second, contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance.",

To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes.

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

    "abstract": "Ensemble clustering has demonstrated great success in practice; however, its theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper examines the generalization performance of ensemble clustering, focusing on generalization error, excess risk and consistency. We derive a convergence rate of generalization error bound and excess risk bound both of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log n}{m}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$, with $n$ and $m$ being the numbers of samples and base clusterings. Based on this, we prove that when $m$ and $n$ approach infinity and $m$ is significantly larger than log $n$, i.e., $m,n\\to \\infty, m\\gg \\log n$, ensemble clustering is consistent. Furthermore, recognizing that $n$ and $m$ are finite in practice, the generalization error cannot be reduced to zero. Thus, by assigning varying weights to finite clusterings, we minimize the error between the empirical average clusterings and their expectation. From this, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve better clustering performance, we should minimize the deviation (bias) of base clustering from its expectation and maximize the differences (diversity) among various base clusterings. Additionally, we derive that maximizing diversity is nearly equivalent to a robust (min-max) optimization model. Finally, we instantiate our theory to develop a new ensemble clustering algorithm.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and accessibility. In this paper, we present \\textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech LLMs without speech data.",

    "abstract": "Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is critical in safety-sensitive applications but is often omitted from off-the-shelf neural networks due to adverse effects on predictive performance. Retrofitting uncertainty estimates post-hoc typically requires access to model parameters or gradients, limiting feasibility in practice. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for post-hoc uncertainty estimation in regression tasks by fitting an auxiliary model to both original inputs and frozen model outputs. Drawing from principles of maximum likelihood estimation and sequential parameter fitting, we formalize an exact post-hoc optimization objective that recovers the canonical MLE of Gaussian parameters, without requiring sampling or approximation at inference. While prior work has used model outputs to estimate uncertainty, we explicitly characterize the conditions under which this is valid and demonstrate the extent to which structured outputs can support quasi-epistemic inference. We find that using diverse auxiliary data, such as augmented subsets of the original training data, significantly enhances OOD detection and metric performance. Our hypothesis that frozen model outputs contain generalizable latent information about model error and predictive uncertainty is tested and confirmed. Finally, we ensure that our method maintains proper estimation of input-dependent uncertainty without relying exclusively on base model forecasts. These findings are demonstrated in toy problems and adapted to both UCI and depth regression benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/biggzlar/IO-CUE.",

It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over the best-performing baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/yq-hong/AutoSEP",

First, we evaluate compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality. Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of compositionality.",

In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Python program. The final SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.",

    "abstract": "Modern language model deployments must often balance competing objectives, for example, helpfulness versus harmlessness, cost versus accuracy, and reward versus safety. We introduce Conformal Arbitrage, a post hoc framework that learns a data driven threshold to mediate between a Primary model optimized for a primary objective and a more conservative Guardian which could be another model or a human domain expert aligned with a guardrail objective. The threshold is calibrated with conformal risk control, yielding finite sample, distribution free guarantees that the long run frequency of undesirable events, such as factual errors or safety violations, does not exceed a user specified quota. Because Conformal Arbitrage operates wholly at the API level, without requiring access to model logits or updating model weights, it complements weight based alignment techniques and integrates seamlessly with existing cost aware cascades. Empirically, Conformal Arbitrage traces an efficient frontier, allowing users to define an acceptable performance level for one objective while maximizing utility in another. We observe that our method outperforms, in terms of accuracy, cost matched random routing between models. These properties make Conformal Arbitrage a practical, theoretically grounded tool for trustworthy and economical deployment of large language models across a broad range of potentially competing objectives.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact, task-specific models by transferring the knowledge from teacher models. However, its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data, whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models are often unavailable. In this paper, we first introduce ActiveKD, a framework that integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured prediction bias of VLMs-i.e., their predictions form clusters in the probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning. To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects probabilistically diverse unlabeled samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under limited annotation budgets. Extensive evaluations on 11 datasets show that ActiveKD consistently improves performance across selection methods (e.g., +29.07% on ImageNet, averaged over methods). Under ActiveKD, PCoreSet ranks first in 64/73 settings (approximately 87.7%) across 5 student and 3 teacher networks, always achieving the best performance except for first 2 AL rounds.

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.",

We evaluate 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) and compare them to human performance. Results show that proprietary models generally outperform open-source ones, yet all models perform far below humans, especially in transformative affordance.

This enables event representations to focus on the most relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video alignment.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into increasingly autonomous agents, fundamental questions about their epistemic foundations remain unresolved: What defines an agent? How should it make decisions? And what objectives should guide its behavior? In this position paper, we argue that true autonomy requires agents to be grounded in a coherent epistemic framework that governs what they know, what they need to know, and how to acquire that knowledge efficiently. We propose a unified theory that treats internal reasoning and external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling agents to systematically coordinate introspection and interaction. Building on this framework, we advocate for aligning an agent's tool use decision-making boundary with its knowledge boundary, thereby minimizing unnecessary tool use and maximizing epistemic efficiency. This perspective shifts the design of agents from mere action executors to knowledge-driven intelligence systems, offering a principled path toward building foundation agents capable of adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior.",

However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The de novo generation of drug-like molecules capable of inducing desirable phenotypic changes is receiving increasing attention. However, previous methods predominantly rely on expression profiles to guide molecule generation, but overlook the perturbative effect of the molecules on cellular contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose SmilesGEN, a novel generative model based on variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to generate molecules with potential therapeutic effects. SmilesGEN integrates a pre-trained drug VAE (SmilesNet) with an expression profile VAE (ProfileNet), jointly modeling the interplay between drug perturbations and transcriptional responses in a common latent space. Specifically, ProfileNet is imposed to reconstruct pre-treatment expression profiles when eliminating drug-induced perturbations in the latent space, while SmilesNet is informed by desired expression profiles to generate drug-like molecules. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that SmilesGEN outperforms current state-of-the-art models in generating molecules with higher degree of validity, uniqueness, novelty, as well as higher Tanimoto similarity to known ligands targeting the relevant proteins. Moreover, we evaluate SmilesGEN for scaffold-based molecule optimization and generation of therapeutic agents, and confirmed its superior performance in generating molecules with higher similarity to approved drugs. SmilesGEN establishes a robust framework that leverages gene signatures to generate drug-like molecules that hold promising potential to induce desirable cellular phenotypic changes.",

With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), a growing number of studies have explored the integration of MRL with LLMs and achieved promising results.

Currently, there is no LLM framework that supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic architectural switching. To address these challenges, reduce redundant coding, and ensure fair model comparison, we propose ModuLM, a framework designed to support flexible LLM-based model construction and diverse molecular representations. ModuLM provides a rich suite of modular components, including 8 types of 2D molecular graph encoders, 11 types of 3D molecular conformation encoders, 7 types of interaction layers, and 7 mainstream LLM backbones. Owing to its highly flexible model assembly mechanism, ModuLM enables the dynamic construction of over 50,000 distinct model configurations. In addition, we provide comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of ModuLM in supporting LLM-based MRL tasks.",

However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models, hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations.

Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students' learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students, accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally, it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of students.",

    "abstract": "Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, the need to fine-tune for each new scenario is often impractical for deployment on edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data at inference time without requiring weight updates. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be incorporated into the hierarchical diffusion planner, providing further performance enhancements.",

The parallel development of systematic evaluation benchmarks emerges as a critical imperative to enable performance assessment and provide technological guidance. Meanwhile, as an invaluable knowledge source, the potential of medical textbooks for benchmark development remains underexploited. Here, we present MedBookVQA, a systematic and comprehensive multimodal benchmark derived from open-access medical textbooks. To curate this benchmark, we propose a standardized pipeline for automated extraction of medical figures while contextually aligning them with corresponding medical narratives. Based on this curated data, we generate 5,000 clinically relevant questions spanning modality recognition, disease classification, anatomical identification, symptom diagnosis, and surgical procedures. A multi-tier annotation system categorizes queries through hierarchical taxonomies encompassing medical imaging modalities (42 categories), body anatomies (125 structures), and clinical specialties (31 departments), enabling nuanced analysis across medical subdomains. We evaluate a wide array of MLLMs, including proprietary, open-sourced, medical, and reasoning models, revealing significant performance disparities across task types and model categories. Our findings highlight critical capability gaps in current GMAI systems while establishing textbook-derived multimodal benchmarks as essential evaluation tools. MedBookVQA establishes textbook-derived benchmarking as a critical paradigm for advancing clinical AI, exposing limitations in GMAI systems while providing anatomically structured performance metrics across specialties.",

    "abstract": "We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.",

Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized mappings. This framework further enables (1) a refined analysis for VAEs, accounting for the generator's generalization, which was previously overlooked; (2) illustrating an explicit trade-off in generalization terms for DMs that depends on the diffusion time $T$; and (3) providing computable bounds for DMs based solely on the training data, allowing the selection of the optimal $T$ and the integration of such bounds into the optimization process to improve model performance.

This has important applications in privacy preservation, removal of outdated or noisy data, and bias mitigation. While machine unlearning has been studied in computer vision and natural language processing, its application to speech is largely unexplored due to the high-dimensional, sequential, and speaker-dependent nature of speech data. We define two fundamental speech unlearning tasks: sample unlearning, which removes individual data points (e.g., a voice recording), and class unlearning, which removes an entire category (e.g., all data from a speaker), while preserving performance on the remaining data. Experiments on keyword spotting and speaker identification demonstrate that unlearning speech data is significantly more challenging than unlearning image or text data. We conclude with key future directions in this area, including structured training, robust evaluation, feature-level unlearning, broader applications, scalable methods, and adversarial robustness.",

Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage.

EvoGit deploys a population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for decentralized, automated, and continual software development.

However, existing methods struggle to capture subtle video dynamics and rich detailed information. In this paper, we leverage preference learning to enhance the performance of vision-language models in fine-grained video captioning, while mitigating several limitations inherent to direct preference optimization (DPO). First, we propose a pipeline for constructing preference pairs that leverages the intrinsic properties of VLMs along with partial assistance from large language models, achieving an optimal balance between cost and data quality. Second, we propose Synergistic Preference Optimization (SynPO), a novel optimization method offering significant advantages over DPO and its variants. SynPO prevents negative preferences from dominating the optimization, explicitly preserves the model's language capability to avoid deviation of the optimization objective, and improves training efficiency by eliminating the need for the reference model. We extensively evaluate SynPO not only on video captioning benchmarks (e.g., VDC, VDD, VATEX) but also across well-established NLP tasks, including general language understanding and preference evaluation, using diverse pretrained models. Results demonstrate that SynPO consistently outperforms DPO variants while achieving 20\\% improvement in training efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/longmalongma/SynPO",

We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation. Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining, bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.",

To this end, we introduce the Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling Framework (TraCR-TMF), a large language model (LLM)-based threat modeling framework for transportation CPS that requires limited cybersecurity expert intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and relevant countermeasures for transportation CPS. Three LLM-based approaches support these identifications: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation approach requiring no cybersecurity expert intervention, (ii) an in-context learning approach with low expert intervention, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning approach with moderate expert intervention. TraCR-TMF offers LLM-based attack path identification for critical assets based on vulnerabilities across transportation CPS entities. Additionally, it incorporates the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores of known exploited vulnerabilities to prioritize threat mitigations. The framework was evaluated through two cases. First, the framework identified relevant attack techniques for various transportation CPS applications, 73% of which were validated by cybersecurity experts as correct. Second, the framework was used to identify attack paths for a target asset in a real-world cyberattack incident. TraCR-TMF successfully predicted exploitations, like lateral movement of adversaries, data exfiltration, and data encryption for ransomware, as reported in the incident. These findings show the efficacy of TraCR-TMF in transportation CPS threat modeling, while reducing the need for extensive involvement of cybersecurity experts. To facilitate real-world adoptions, all our codes are shared via an open-source repository.",

Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge.

To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at https://github.com/kzjkzj666/CompKE.",

Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent large language models (LLMs), empowered by massive parameter scales and pretraining on vast corpora, have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across various tasks. However, their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a flexible Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor, implemented via either in-context learning or lightweight fine-tuning, to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving superior performance over existing methods.",

In this study, we assess the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs using two approaches: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and a soft prompt attack. FGSM introduces minimal perturbations to input sequences, while the soft prompt attack optimizes continuous embeddings to manipulate model predictions without modifying the input tokens. By combining these techniques, SafeGenes provides a comprehensive assessment of GFM susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Targeted soft prompt attacks induced severe degradation in MLM-based shallow architectures such as ProteinBERT, while still producing substantial failure modes even in high-capacity foundation models such as ESM1b and ESM1v.

To address these challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/scut-zx/L3A.",

In this work, we challenge this assumption by introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other membership edges.

    "abstract": "The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced their performance by enabling in-depth understanding of diverse tasks. With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks, despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g., domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.",

    "abstract": "Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies, which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the `action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies. Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality. Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios, underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.",

Predicting an idea's chance of success is thus crucial for accelerating empirical AI research, a skill that even expert researchers can only acquire through substantial experience. We build the first benchmark for this task and compare LMs with human experts. Concretely, given two research ideas (e.g., two jailbreaking methods), we aim to predict which will perform better on a set of benchmarks. We scrape ideas and experimental results from conference papers, yielding 1,585 human-verified idea pairs published after our base model's cut-off date for testing, and 6,000 pairs for training. We then develop a system that combines a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, and we recruit 25 human experts to compare with. In the NLP domain, our system beats human experts by a large margin (64.4% v.s. 48.9%). On the full test set, our system achieves 77% accuracy, while off-the-shelf frontier LMs like o3 perform no better than random guessing, even with the same retrieval augmentation. We verify that our system does not exploit superficial features like idea complexity through extensive human-written and LM-designed robustness tests. Finally, we evaluate our system on unpublished novel ideas, including ideas generated by an AI ideation agent. Our system achieves 63.6% accuracy, demonstrating its potential as a reward model for improving idea generation models.

    "abstract": "Automating the enrichment of UML class diagrams with behavioral methods from natural language use cases is a significant challenge. This study evaluates nine large language models (LLMs) in augmenting a methodless UML diagram (21 classes, 17 relationships) using 21 structured waste-management use cases. A total of 90 diagrams (3,373 methods) were assessed across six metrics: method quantity, signature richness (visibility, names, parameters, return types), annotation completeness (linking to use cases/actions), structural fidelity, syntactic correctness (PlantUML compilation), and naming convergence (across models). All LLMs produced valid PlantUML diagrams adhering to UML conventions. Some models excelled in method coverage and annotation accuracy, while others showed richer parameterization but weaker traceability. These results demonstrate that LLMs can generate well-structured methods with consistent naming, advancing automated behavioral modeling. However, inconsistencies in annotations and signatures highlight the need for improved prompt engineering and model selection. The rapid generation of these methods supports Agile practices by enabling faster design iterations. Despite their capabilities, human oversight is essential to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and semantic alignment. This positions LLMs as collaborative partners in software design.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

Automated red teaming serves as a tool to detect security vulnerabilities in LLMs without manual labor.

To address this challenge, we propose \\ourapproach, a novel automated red teaming training framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to explore and generate more effective attack prompts while balancing their diversity. Specifically, it consists of three training stages: (1) Cold Start: The red team model is supervised and fine-tuned on a jailbreak dataset obtained through imitation learning. (2) Warm-up Exploration: The model is trained in jailbreak instruction following and exploration, using diversity and consistency as reward signals. (3) Enhanced Jailbreak: Progressive jailbreak rewards are introduced to gradually enhance the jailbreak performance of the red-team model. Extensive experiments on a variety of LLMs show that \\ourapproach effectively balances the diversity and effectiveness of jailbreak prompts compared to existing methods. Our work significantly improves the efficiency of red team exploration and provides a new perspective on automated red teaming.",

The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.",

To systematically investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source of uncertainty, we introduce \\textbf{ConfuseBench}, a benchmark mainly focus on three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries.

However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA.

Previous deep learning approaches address this through supervised tasks like molecule inpainting or property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, E(3)-equivariant latent space independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an E(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes, distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks. Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation, including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor, generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new avenues for molecule editing and optimization.",

Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline.\n  Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.",

    "abstract": "Accurate house-price forecasting is essential for investors, planners, and researchers. However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records, enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets. Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components across different document types.",

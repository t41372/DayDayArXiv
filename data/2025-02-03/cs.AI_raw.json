    "abstract": "Optimal transport (OT) aims to find a map $T$ that transports mass from one\nprobability measure to another while minimizing a cost function. Recently,\nneural OT solvers have gained popularity in high dimensional biological\napplications such as drug perturbation, due to their superior computational and\nmemory efficiency compared to traditional exact Sinkhorn solvers. However, the\noverly complex high dimensional maps learned by neural OT solvers often suffer\nfrom poor interpretability. Prior work addressed this issue in the context of\nexact OT solvers by introducing \\emph{displacement-sparse maps} via designed\nelastic cost, but such method failed to be applied to neural OT settings. In\nthis work, we propose an intuitive and theoretically grounded approach to\nlearning \\emph{displacement-sparse maps} within neural OT solvers. Building on\nour new formulation, we introduce a novel smoothed $\\ell_0$ regularizer that\noutperforms the $\\ell_1$ based alternative from prior work. Leveraging Input\nConvex Neural Network's flexibility, we further develop a heuristic framework\nfor adaptively controlling sparsity intensity, an approach uniquely enabled by\nthe neural OT paradigm. We demonstrate the necessity of this adaptive framework\nin large-scale, high-dimensional training, showing not only improved accuracy\nbut also practical ease of use for downstream applications.",

To mitigate these difficulties, we propose\nDomain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning\nframework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site\nsettings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement,\ndecomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific\ncomponents, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data\nspecificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge\ntransfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning\nmodule enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We\nevaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its\ngeneralizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior\nclassification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an\nenhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional\nconnectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively,\nuncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites.

In this paper, we systematically\nunderstand, identify, and provide a better approach to address these\nchallenges. First, we design a comprehensive systemization of FL defenses along\nthree dimensions: i) how client updates are processed, ii) what the server\nknows, and iii) at what stage the defense is applied. Next, we thoroughly\nsurvey 50 top-tier defense papers and identify the commonly used components in\ntheir evaluation setups. Based on this survey, we uncover six distinct pitfalls\nand study their prevalence. For example, we discover that around 30% of these\nworks solely use the intrinsically robust MNIST dataset, and 40% employ\nsimplistic attacks, which may inadvertently portray their defense as robust.\nUsing three representative defenses as case studies, we perform a critical\nreevaluation to study the impact of the identified pitfalls and show how they\nlead to incorrect conclusions about robustness.

Although\ntechniques such as SMOTE and mutation-based augmentation are widely used in\nsoftware testing and debugging applications, a rigorous understanding of how\naugmented training data impacts model bias is lacking. It is especially\ncritical to consider bias in scenarios where augmented data sets are used not\njust in training but also in testing models.

    "abstract": "Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix\nthe underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the\nbug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging,\nbut they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in\nindustrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has\nthe potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair.\nThis paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting,\nspecifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale,\nproprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from\nGoogle's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT\ngeneration technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent,\nwhich makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing.\nOur BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT\ngeneration rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from\nGoogle's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of\ngenerated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR)\nsystem at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system\nresults in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce\nEnsemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select\nthe most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation\non EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising\nresults and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from\na pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.",

We also show that when classes\nform an equivariant map, grokking can be explained by the model's ability to\nlearn from similar classes or sub-categories. Unlike earlier work suggesting\nthat grokking primarily arises from high regularization and sparse data, we\ndemonstrate that it can also occur with dense data and minimal hyper-parameter\ntuning.

However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human)\npairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can\nsurprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models,\neven with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent\nadvantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be\ngenuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation\nprocess. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct\nexperiments with several large language models from the Llama family. We find\nthat, across multiple knowledge areas from the popular MMLU benchmark dataset,\ncoupled autoregressive generation requires up to 40% fewer samples to reach the\nsame conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, using data from\nthe LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform, we find that the win-rates derived from\npairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts differ under\ncoupled and vanilla autoregressive generation.",

    "abstract": "Grokking typically achieves similar loss to ordinary, \"steady\", learning. We\nask whether these different learning paths - grokking versus ordinary training\n- lead to fundamental differences in the learned models. To do so we compare\nthe features, compressibility, and learning dynamics of models trained via each\npath in two tasks. We find that grokked and steadily trained models learn the\nsame features, but there can be large differences in the efficiency with which\nthese features are encoded. In particular, we find a novel \"compressive regime\"\nof steady training in which there emerges a linear trade-off between model loss\nand compressibility, and which is absent in grokking. In this regime, we can\nachieve compression factors 25x times the base model, and 5x times the\ncompression achieved in grokking. We then track how model features and\ncompressibility develop through training. We show that model development in\ngrokking is task-dependent, and that peak compressibility is achieved\nimmediately after the grokking plateau. Finally, novel information-geometric\nmeasures are introduced which demonstrate that models undergoing grokking\nfollow a straight path in information space.",

In this work, we conduct an in-depth collaboration with\nradiologists in prostate cancer diagnosis based on MRI images. Building on\nexisting tools for teaching prostate cancer diagnosis, we develop an interface\nand conduct two experiments to study how AI assistance and performance feedback\nshape the decision making of domain experts. In Study 1, clinicians were asked\nto provide an initial diagnosis (human), then view the AI's prediction, and\nsubsequently finalize their decision (human-AI team). In Study 2 (after a\nmemory wash-out period), the same participants first received aggregated\nperformance statistics from Study 1, specifically their own performance, the\nAI's performance, and their human-AI team performance, and then directly viewed\nthe AI's prediction before making their diagnosis (i.e., no independent initial\ndiagnosis). These two workflows represent realistic ways that clinical AI tools\nmight be used in practice, where the second study simulates a scenario where\ndoctors can adjust their reliance and trust on AI based on prior performance\nfeedback. Our findings show that, while human-AI teams consistently outperform\nhumans alone, they still underperform the AI due to under-reliance, similar to\nprior studies with crowdworkers. Providing clinicians with performance feedback\ndid not significantly improve the performance of human-AI teams, although\nshowing AI decisions in advance nudges people to follow AI more. Meanwhile, we\nobserve that the ensemble of human-AI teams can outperform AI alone, suggesting\npromising directions for human-AI collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are\nincreasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance\nframeworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs\nthat elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers\nfrom two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot evaluate realistic\nrisks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any\nparticular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's\nworst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for\neliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering\nattacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit\nstate-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a\nsuite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to\nbenchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model\nresilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional\nrobustness subspace; (2) the attack success rate of model tampering attacks can\nempirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of\nheld-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can\neasily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together these results\nhighlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that\nmodel tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than\ninput-space attacks alone.",

    "abstract": "Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital\nenvironments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered\nby instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from\ninterface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in\ntheir respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half\nof tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a\nreinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target\nenvironments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov\ndecision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of\nproximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly\none copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation\nstraightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A\n32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment\noutperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15%\nrelative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to\nIDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via\ndirect API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this\narea, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid\nunwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.",

The algorithm is\nreinforced with techniques including verbalized commitment assumptions,\nverbalized obedience constraints, and information obfuscation.

R1 can also be\nremarkably \"uncertain\" in its output and in rare cases, it does not \"finish\nthinking,\" which suggests the need for techniques to \"wrap up\" before the\ncontext window limit is reached.

As a consequence, learning effective representations of numbers is\ncritical for the success of large language models as they become more\nintegrated into everyday decisions. However, these models face a challenge:\ndepending on context, the same sequence of digit tokens, e.g., 911, can be\ntreated as a number or as a string. What kind of representations arise from\nthis duality, and what are its downstream implications? Using a\nsimilarity-based prompting technique from cognitive science, we show that LLMs\nlearn representational spaces that blend string-like and numerical\nrepresentations. In particular, we show that elicited similarity judgments from\nthese models over integer pairs can be captured by a combination of Levenshtein\nedit distance and numerical Log-Linear distance, suggesting an entangled\nrepresentation. In a series of experiments we show how this entanglement is\nreflected in the latent embeddings, how it can be reduced but not entirely\neliminated by context, and how it can propagate into a realistic decision\nscenario. These results shed light on a representational tension in transformer\nmodels that must learn what a number is from text input.",

In this work, we\nexpose preference leakage, a contamination problem in LLM-as-a-judge caused by\nthe relatedness between the synthetic data generators and LLM-based evaluators.\nTo study this issue, we first define three common relatednesses between data\ngenerator LLM and judge LLM: being the same model, having an inheritance\nrelationship, and belonging to the same model family.

    "abstract": "While conventional Transformers generally operate on sequence data, they can\nbe used in conjunction with structure models, typically SE(3)-invariant or\nequivariant graph neural networks (GNNs), for 3D applications such as protein\nstructure modelling. These hybrids typically involve either (1)\npreprocessing/tokenizing structural features as input for Transformers or (2)\ntaking Transformer embeddings and processing them within a structural\nrepresentation. However, there is evidence that Transformers can learn to\nprocess structural information on their own, such as the AlphaFold3 structural\ndiffusion model. In this work we show that Transformers can function\nindependently as structure models when passed linear embeddings of coordinates.\nWe first provide a theoretical explanation for how Transformers can learn to\nfilter attention as a 3D Gaussian with learned variance. We then validate this\ntheory using both simulated 3D points and in the context of masked token\nprediction for proteins. Finally, we show that pre-training protein Transformer\nencoders with structure improves performance on a downstream task, yielding\nbetter performance than custom structural models. Together, this work provides\na basis for using standard Transformers as hybrid structure-language models.",

    "abstract": "The integration of vision-language modalities has been a significant focus in\nmultimodal learning, traditionally relying on Vision-Language Pretrained\nModels. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has\nbeen a notable shift towards incorporating LLMs with vision modalities.\nFollowing this, the training paradigms for incorporating vision modalities into\nLLMs have evolved. Initially, the approach was to integrate the modalities\nthrough pretraining the modality integrator, named Single-stage Tuning. It has\nsince branched out into methods focusing on performance enhancement, denoted as\nTwo-stage Tuning, and those prioritizing parameter efficiency, referred to as\nDirect Adaptation. However, existing surveys primarily address the latest\nVision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with Two-stage Tuning, leaving a gap in\nunderstanding the evolution of training paradigms and their unique\nparameter-efficient considerations. This paper categorizes and reviews 34 VLLMs\nfrom top conferences, journals, and highly cited Arxiv papers, focusing on\nparameter efficiency during adaptation from the training paradigm perspective.\nWe first introduce the architecture of LLMs and parameter-efficient learning\nmethods, followed by a discussion on vision encoders and a comprehensive\ntaxonomy of modality integrators. We then review three training paradigms and\ntheir efficiency considerations, summarizing benchmarks in the VLLM field. To\ngain deeper insights into their effectiveness in parameter efficiency, we\ncompare and discuss the experimental results of representative models, among\nwhich the experiment of the Direct Adaptation paradigm is replicated. Providing\ninsights into recent developments and practical uses, this survey is a vital\nguide for researchers and practitioners navigating the efficient integration of\nvision modalities into LLMs.",

    "abstract": "The ability to accurately produce geometries with specified properties is\nperhaps the most important characteristic of a manufacturing process. 3D\nprinting is marked by exceptional design freedom and complexity but is also\nprone to geometric and other defects that must be resolved for it to reach its\nfull potential. Ultimately, this will require both astute design decisions and\ntimely parameter adjustments to maintain stability that is challenging even\nwith expert human operators. While machine learning is widely investigated in\n3D printing, existing methods typically overlook spatial features that vary\nacross prints and thus find it difficult to produce desired geometries. Here,\nwe encode volumetric representations of printed parts into neural fields and\napply a new regularization strategy, based on minimizing the partial derivative\nof the field's output with respect to a single, non-learnable parameter. By\nthus encouraging small input changes to yield only small output variations, we\nencourage smooth interpolation between observed volumes and hence realistic\ngeometry predictions. This framework therefore allows the extraction of\n'imagined' 3D shapes, revealing how a part would look if manufactured under\npreviously unseen parameters. The resulting continuous field is used for\ndata-driven optimization to maximize geometric fidelity between expected and\nproduced geometries, reducing post-processing, material waste, and production\ncosts. By optimizing process parameters dynamically, our approach enables\nadvanced planning strategies, potentially allowing manufacturers to better\nrealize complex and feature-rich designs.",

To this end,\nwe design a variety of LLM-based agent types and construct four distinct\nnetwork structures to conduct these simulations. Our framework assesses the\neffectiveness of different network constructions and agent behaviors in\ninfluencing the spread of rumors. Our results demonstrate that the framework\ncan simulate rumor spreading across more than one hundred agents in various\nnetworks with thousands of edges. The evaluations indicate that network\nstructure, personas, and spreading schemes can significantly influence rumor\ndissemination, ranging from no spread to affecting 83\\% of agents in\niterations, thereby offering a realistic simulation of rumor spread in social\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "Defect detection in fabrics is critical for quality control, yet existing\nmethods often struggle with complex backgrounds and shape-specific defects. In\nthis paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on\nYOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip\nPerception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale\nconvolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by\nintegrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF\nmodule, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more\neffective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal\nenhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive\nweights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the\nweights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average\nprecision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our\ncustom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained unprecedented prominence, achieving\nwidespread adoption across diverse domains and integrating deeply into society.\nThe capability to fine-tune general-purpose LLMs, such as Generative\nPre-trained Transformers (GPT), for specific tasks has facilitated the\nemergence of numerous Custom GPTs. These tailored models are increasingly made\navailable through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However,\ntheir black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In\nthis work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of\nCustom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible\nbehaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a\nred-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the\ncharacteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to\nanalyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations. We validate\nour framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a\nlarge-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic,\nCybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1\nscore of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of\nthe framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed\nmodels exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT\nstore's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that\na model's popularity does not correlate with compliance, and non-compliance\nissues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than\nuser-driven customizations. We believe this approach is extendable to other\nchatbot platforms and policy domains, improving LLM-based systems safety.",

    "abstract": "Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and\naiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance\nbetween precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this\nlimitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as\nresponses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective\nProgressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the\ncontribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key\nobservations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall;\nthus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen,\nvisual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by\nleveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention\ngradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our\nexperiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate\nthat existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In\ncontrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal\ncomputational overhead.",

Furthermore, applying a uniform\ncompression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the\nvarying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose\nAdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD\nintroduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by\nalternately updating the singular matrices $\\mathcal{U}$ and\n$\\mathcal{V}^\\top$. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively\nassigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of\neach layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM/VLM families and\nevaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with\nsignificantly reduced memory requirements.

    "abstract": "In an era dominated by datafication, the reduction of human experiences to\nquantifiable metrics raises profound philosophical and ethical questions. This\npaper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of\nAlbert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the\nexistential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP)\ntechniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and\nnamed entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors\nin Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying\nalgorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in\nexistential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools\nmisinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the\nbroader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points,\nchallenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The\nfindings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance\non data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in\nartificial intelligence.",

Despite extensive efforts, they are all stuck in a\nstate of resource competition demanding significant time and computing\nexpenses. The cause of the situation lies in the failure of identifying the\nfundamental feature of the solutions in this line, coined as the self-denial of\nLLMs. In other words, LLMs should confidently determine the potential existence\nof mistakes and carefully execute the targeted correction. As the whole\nprocedure conducts within LLMs, supporting and persuasive references are hard\nto acquire, while the absence of specific steps towards refining hidden\nmistakes persists even when errors are acknowledged. In response to the\nchallenges, we present PSSD, which refers to and implements the human psyche\nstructure such that three distinct and interconnected roles contribute to human\nreasoning. Specifically, PSSD leverages the recent multi-agent paradigm, and is\nfurther enhanced with three innovatively conceived roles: (1) the\nintuition-based id role that provides initial attempts based on benign LLMs;\n(2) the rule-driven superego role that summarizes rules to regulate the above\nattempts, and returns specific key points as guidance; and (3) the\nscript-centric ego role that absorbs all procedural information to generate\nexecutable script for the final answer prediction.

To address this challenge and exploit the redundancy within feature\nmap channels, we propose a new solution: partial channel mechanism (PCM).\nSpecifically, through the split operation, the feature map channels are divided\ninto different parts, with each part corresponding to different operations,\nsuch as convolution, attention, pooling, and identity mapping. Based on this\nassumption, we introduce a novel partial attention convolution (PATConv) that\ncan efficiently combine convolution with visual attention. Our exploration\nindicates that the PATConv can completely replace both the regular convolution\nand the regular visual attention while reducing model parameters and FLOPs.\nMoreover, PATConv can derive three new types of blocks: Partial\nChannel-Attention block (PAT_ch), Partial Spatial-Attention block (PAT_sp), and\nPartial Self-Attention block (PAT_sf). In addition, we propose a novel dynamic\npartial convolution (DPConv) that can adaptively learn the proportion of split\nchannels in different layers to achieve better trade-offs. Building on PATConv\nand DPConv, we propose a new hybrid network family, named PartialNet, which\nachieves superior top-1 accuracy and inference speed compared to some SOTA\nmodels on ImageNet-1K classification and excels in both detection and\nsegmentation on the COCO dataset.

Another problem\nwith online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with\ndynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot\nmeta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning\n(CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed\nalgorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online\ninteraction with the environments.

Numerical results show that the\nproposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline\nschemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL.

To remedy this, we propose an\ninitialization scheme that single-handedly preserves unitary variance in\ntransformers and convolutional networks, ensuring stable gradient flow even in\ndeep architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that networks with\nHermite, Fourier, and Tropical-based learnable activations significantly\nimprove over GPT-2 and ConvNeXt networks in terms of accuracy and perplexity in\ntrain and test, highlighting the viability of learnable activations in\nlarge-scale tasks. The activation functions developed here are the subject of a\nlibrary coded entirely in pure PyTorch: torchortho, available at\nhttps://github.com/K-H-Ismail/torchortho.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise across various\nmedical applications, with ophthalmology being a notable area of focus. Many\nophthalmic tasks have shown substantial improvement through the integration of\nLLMs. However, before these models can be widely adopted in clinical practice,\nevaluating their capabilities and identifying their limitations is crucial. To\naddress this research gap and support the real-world application of LLMs, we\nintroduce the OphthBench, a specialized benchmark designed to assess LLM\nperformance within the context of Chinese ophthalmic practices. This benchmark\nsystematically divides a typical ophthalmic clinical workflow into five key\nscenarios: Education, Triage, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis. For each\nscenario, we developed multiple tasks featuring diverse question types,\nresulting in a comprehensive benchmark comprising 9 tasks and 591 questions.\nThis comprehensive framework allows for a thorough assessment of LLMs'\ncapabilities and provides insights into their practical application in Chinese\nophthalmology. Using this benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments and\nanalyzed the results from 39 popular LLMs. Our evaluation highlights the\ncurrent gap between LLM development and its practical utility in clinical\nsettings, providing a clear direction for future advancements. By bridging this\ngap, we aim to unlock the potential of LLMs and advance their development in\nophthalmology.",

To address these challenges, this study\nproposes a novel framework employing large language models (LLMs) as automated\nfacilitators within a custom-built multi-user chat system. Leveraging cosine\nsimilarity as a core metric, this approach evaluates the ability of three\nstate-of-the-art LLMs- ChatGPT 4.0, Mistral Large 2, and AI21 Jamba Instruct-\nto synthesize consensus proposals that align with participants' viewpoints.\nUnlike conventional techniques, the system integrates adaptive facilitation\nstrategies, including clarifying misunderstandings, summarizing discussions,\nand proposing compromises, enabling the LLMs to iteratively refine consensus\nproposals based on user feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of ChatGPT 4.0, which achieves higher alignment with participant\nopinions, requiring fewer iterations to reach consensus compared to its\ncounterparts. Moreover, analysis reveals the nuanced performance of the models\nacross various sustainability-focused discussion topics, such as climate\naction, quality education, good health and well-being, and access to clean\nwater and sanitation.

However, conventional Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)\nfocuses on training DNNs with uniform bit-width. The bit-width settings vary\nacross different hardware and transmission demands, which induces considerable\ntraining and storage costs. Hence, the scheme of one-shot joint training\nmultiple precisions is proposed to address this issue. Previous works either\nstore a larger FP32 model to switch between different precision models for\nhigher accuracy or store a smaller INT8 model but compromise accuracy due to\nusing shared quantization parameters. In this paper, we introduce the Double\nRounding quantization method, which fully utilizes the quantized representation\nrange to accomplish nearly lossless bit-switching while reducing storage by\nusing the highest integer precision instead of full precision. Furthermore, we\nobserve a competitive interference among different precisions during one-shot\njoint training, primarily due to inconsistent gradients of quantization scales\nduring backward propagation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Adaptive\nLearning Rate Scaling (ALRS) technique that dynamically adapts learning rates\nfor various precisions to optimize the training process. Additionally, we\nextend our Double Rounding to one-shot mixed precision training and develop a\nHessian-Aware Stochastic Bit-switching (HASB) strategy.

    "abstract": "Despite the significant advances in neural machine translation, performance\nremains subpar for low-resource language pairs. Ensembling multiple systems is\na widely adopted technique to enhance performance, often accomplished by\ncombining probability distributions. However, the previous approaches face the\nchallenge of high computational costs for training multiple models.\nFurthermore, for black-box models, averaging token-level probabilities at each\ndecoding step is not feasible. To address the problems of multi-model ensemble\nmethods, we present a pivot-based single model ensemble. The proposed strategy\nconsists of two steps: pivot-based candidate generation and post-hoc\naggregation. In the first step, we generate candidates through pivot\ntranslation. This can be achieved with only a single model and facilitates\nknowledge transfer from high-resource pivot languages, resulting in candidates\nthat are not only diverse but also more accurate. Next, in the aggregation\nstep, we select k high-quality candidates from the generated candidates and\nmerge them to generate a final translation that outperforms the existing\ncandidates. Our experimental results show that our method produces translations\nof superior quality by leveraging candidates from pivot translation to capture\nthe subtle nuances of the source sentence.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better\nfeature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based\ntasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are\ntypically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the\nperformance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of\nmodalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the\nmultimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing\nsmaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly\nwhen dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the\nModality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model\ncompression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge\nfrom ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a\nsmaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks,\nallowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs\nmulti-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the\nuse of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring\nimputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an\noptimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal\nrepresentations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during\ntraining. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks\nusing time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the\ngeneralizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal\nmulticlass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the\nperformance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as\nvarious fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing\nhuman-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated\nwhole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch\nbetween simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system\nidentification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on\nlabor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that\nsacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and\nReal-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics\nmismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we\npre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion\ndata. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect\nreal-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for\nthe dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the\ndelta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with\nreal-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym\nto IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1\nhumanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body\ncoordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared\nto SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile\nmotions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential\nof delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These\nresults suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more\nexpressive and agile humanoids.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to solve sequential\ndecision-making tasks such as multi-armed bandits (MAB), in which an LLM is\ndirectly instructed to select the arms to pull in every iteration. However,\nthis paradigm of direct arm selection using LLMs has been shown to be\nsuboptimal in many MAB tasks. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach\nwhich combines the strengths of classical MAB and LLMs. Specifically, we adopt\na classical MAB algorithm as the high-level framework and leverage the strong\nin-context learning capability of LLMs to perform the sub-task of reward\nprediction. Firstly, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor into the\nclassical Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm and adopt a decaying schedule for\nthe LLM temperature to ensure a transition from exploration to exploitation.\nNext, we incorporate the LLM-based reward predictor (with a temperature of 0)\ninto a regression oracle-based MAB algorithm equipped with an explicit\nexploration mechanism. We also extend our TS-based algorithm to dueling bandits\nwhere only the preference feedback between pairs of arms is available, which\nrequires non-trivial algorithmic modifications. We conduct empirical\nevaluations using both synthetic MAB tasks and experiments designed using\nreal-world text datasets, in which the results show that our algorithms\nconsistently outperform previous baseline methods based on direct arm\nselection. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that in challenging tasks where\nthe arms lack semantic meanings that can be exploited by the LLM, our approach\nachieves considerably better performance than LLM-based direct arm selection.",

Traditional\nprocessing methods rely heavily on task-specific designs to address these\nchallenges and fail to account for the variability of data. To address these\nlimitations, we present a generative seismic foundation model (GSFM), a unified\nframework based on generative diffusion models (GDMs), designed to tackle\nmulti-task seismic processing challenges, including denoising, backscattered\nnoise attenuation, interpolation, and low-frequency extrapolation.

Also, field data tests suggest that our iterative fine-tuning\napproach addresses the generalization limitations of conventional pre-training\nand fine-tuning paradigms, delivering significantly enhanced performance across\ndiverse tasks.

    "abstract": "The releases of OpenAI's o-[n] series, such as o1, o3, and o4-mini, mark a\nsignificant paradigm shift in Large Language Models towards advanced reasoning\ncapabilities. Notably, models like o3 have demonstrated strong performance on\nbenchmarks like the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General\nIntelligence (ARC-AGI). However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic\npatterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios\ninvolving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to\ninvestigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks. To this end,\nwe track the evolution of the GPT-[n] and o-[n] series models (including o1,\no3, and o4-mini) on challenging multimodal puzzles from PuzzleVQA and\nAlgoPuzzleVQA, which demand fine-grained visual perception. Our results reveal\nthat o-[n] series, particularly later iterations like o3 and o4-mini,\nsignificantly outperform the GPT-[n] series and show strong scalability in\nmultimodal reasoning. Nonetheless, despite these substantial advancements and\nthe superior capabilities demonstrated by the o-[n] series, our findings\nhighlight that even these leading models face persistent challenges.\nDifficulties are particularly evident in tasks requiring precise visual\nperception, robust compositional reasoning across multiple visual attributes,\nand solving complex algorithmic or highly combinatorial puzzles, indicating\ncritical areas for future AGI development. We plan to continuously track new\nmodels in the series and update our results in this paper accordingly.

To overcome these limitations, this paper\nintroduces Refined Adaptive Zeroth-Order Optimization (R-AdaZO). Specifically,\nwe first show the untapped variance reduction effect of first moment estimate\non ZO gradient estimation, which improves the accuracy and stability of ZO\nupdates. We then refine the second moment estimate based on these\nvariance-reduced gradient estimates to better capture the geometry of the\noptimization landscape, enabling a more effective scaling of ZO updates. We\npresent rigorous theoretical analysis to show (I) the first analysis to the\nvariance reduction of first moment estimate in ZO optimization, (II) the\nimproved second moment estimates with a more accurate approximation of its\nvariance-free ideal, (III) the first variance-aware convergence framework for\nadaptive ZO methods, which may be of independent interest, and (IV) the faster\nconvergence of R-AdaZO than existing baselines like ZO-AdaMM.

The low-rank\nnature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of\nfine-tuned models, however, thus potentially compromising performance on\ncomplex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between\nLoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of\ntrainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this\nquestion by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs\nfull-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank,\nnon-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable\nparameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to\nthe fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank\nlimitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training.\nThrough extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language\nbenchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing\nrandom basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial\nacross vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for\nvision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes\neliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA,\ndemonstrating its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Music is a deeply personal experience and our aim is to enhance this with a\nfully-automated pipeline for personalized music video generation. Our work\nallows listeners to not just be consumers but co-creators in the music video\ngeneration process by creating personalized, consistent and context-driven\nvisuals based on lyrics, rhythm and emotion in the music. The pipeline combines\nmultimodal translation and generation techniques and utilizes low-rank\nadaptation on listeners' images to create immersive music videos that reflect\nboth the music and the individual. To ensure the ethical use of users'\nidentity, we also introduce CHARCHA (patent pending), a facial identity\nverification protocol that protects people against unauthorized use of their\nface while at the same time collecting authorized images from users for\npersonalizing their videos. This paper thus provides a secure and innovative\nframework for creating deeply personalized music videos.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for\nforecasting the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Unlike traditional MLP-based\nneural networks that are often criticized for their black-box nature, KAN\noffers an interpretable approach via learnable spline-based activation\nfunctions and symbolification. Based on a parsimonious architecture with\nsymbolic functions, KAN expresses a forecast of the VIX as a closed-form in\nterms of explanatory variables, and provide interpretable insights into key\ncharacteristics of the VIX, including mean reversion and the leverage effect.\nThrough in-depth empirical analysis across multiple datasets and periods, we\nshow that KANs achieve competitive forecasting performance while requiring\nsignificantly fewer parameters compared to MLP-based neural network models. Our\nfindings demonstrate the capacity and potential of KAN as an interpretable\nfinancial time-series forecasting method.",

    "abstract": "As the demand for high-quality data in model training grows, researchers and\ndevelopers are increasingly generating synthetic data to tune and train LLMs.\nHowever, current data generation methods rely on seed sets containing tens of\nthousands of examples to prompt instruction-tuned models. This reliance can be\nespecially problematic when the curation of high-quality examples is expensive\nor difficult. In this paper we explore the novel few-shot synthetic data\ngeneration setting -- generating a high-quality dataset from a few examples. We\nshow that when working with only a few seed examples, instruction-tuned models\nused in current synthetic data methods produce insufficient diversity for\ndownstream tasks. In contrast, we show that base models without post-training,\nlargely untapped for synthetic data generation, offer substantially greater\noutput diversity, albeit with lower instruction following abilities. Leveraging\nthis insight, we propose Base-Refine (BARE), a novel two-stage method that\ncombines the diversity of base models with the quality assurance of\ninstruction-tuned models. BARE excels in few-shot synthetic data generation:\nusing only 3 seed examples it generates diverse, high-quality datasets that\nsignificantly improve downstream task performance. We show that fine-tuning\nLlama 3.1 8B with 1,000 BARE-generated samples achieves performance comparable\nto state-of-the-art similarly sized models on LiveCodeBench tasks. Furthermore,\ndata generated with BARE enables a 101% improvement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.2\n1B on GSM8K over data generated by only instruction-models, and an 18.4%\nimprovement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B over the state-of-the-art RAFT method\nfor RAG data generation.",

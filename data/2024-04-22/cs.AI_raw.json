This dataset can be used as a foundation\nto support future research on adversarial AI-art. Next, we present a user study\nthat employs the ARIA dataset to evaluate if real-world users can distinguish\nwith or without reference images.

In this work,\nwe consider the problem of discovering the agent-centric state in the more\nchallenging high-dimensional non-Markovian setting, when the state can be\ndecoded from a sequence of past observations. We establish that generalized\ninverse models can be adapted for learning agent-centric state representation\nfor this task. Our results include asymptotic theory in the deterministic\ndynamics setting as well as counter-examples for alternative intuitive\nalgorithms. We complement these findings with a thorough empirical study on the\nagent-centric state discovery abilities of the different alternatives we put\nforward. Particularly notable is our analysis of past actions, where we show\nthat these can be a double-edged sword: making the algorithms more successful\nwhen used correctly and causing dramatic failure when used incorrectly.",

To\naddress these disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose\nSpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance\ngap between byte-level and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte\nconsists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer\nblocks inserted in the middle of the layers.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in processing\nextensive contexts, with the Key-Value (KV) cache playing a vital role in\nenhancing their performance. However, the growth of the KV cache in response to\nincreasing input length poses challenges to memory and time efficiency. To\naddress this problem, this paper introduces SnapKV, an innovative and\nfine-tuning-free approach that efficiently minimizes KV cache size while still\ndelivering comparable performance in real-world applications.\n  We discover that each attention head in the model consistently focuses on\nspecific prompt attention features during generation. Meanwhile, this robust\npattern can be obtained from an 'observation' window located at the end of the\nprompts. Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by\nselecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head. Our\napproach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory\nfootprint when processing long input sequences. Specifically, SnapKV achieves a\nconsistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x\nenhancement in memory efficiency compared to the baseline when processing\ninputs of 16K tokens. At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to\nthe baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets. Moreover, SnapKV can\nprocess up to 380K context tokens on a single A100-80GB GPU using HuggingFace\nimplementation with minor changes, exhibiting only a negligible accuracy drop\nin the Needle-in-a-Haystack test. Further comprehensive studies suggest\nSnapKV's potential for practical applications.",

Such behavior is not a problem for automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR), but it can cause inaccurate forced alignments (FA),\nespecially at finer granularity, e.g., phoneme level. This paper aims at\nalleviating the peaky behavior for CTC and improve its suitability for forced\nalignment generation, by leveraging label priors, so that the scores of\nalignment paths containing fewer blanks are boosted and maximized during\ntraining. As a result, our CTC model produces less peaky posteriors and is able\nto more accurately predict the offset of the tokens besides their onset. It\noutperforms the standard CTC model and a heuristics-based approach for\nobtaining CTC's token offset timestamps by 12-40% in phoneme and word boundary\nerrors (PBE and WBE) measured on the Buckeye and TIMIT data. Compared with the\nmost widely used FA toolkit Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA), our method performs\nsimilarly on PBE/WBE on Buckeye, yet falls behind MFA on TIMIT.

One existing practice\nis Graphic Layout Generation (GLG), which aims to layout sequential design\nelements. It has been constrained by the necessity for a predefined correct\nsequence of layers, thus limiting creative potential and increasing user\nworkload. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG) as a\nmore flexible and pragmatic setup, which creates graphic composition from\nunordered sets of design elements. To tackle the HLG task, we introduce\nGraphist, the first layout generation model based on large multimodal models.\nGraphist efficiently reframes the HLG as a sequence generation problem,\nutilizing RGB-A images as input, outputs a JSON draft protocol, indicating the\ncoordinates, size, and order of each element.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing deep\nlearning-based models for automated code completion. Although using source code\nin GitHub has been a common practice for training deep-learning-based models\nfor code completion, it may induce some legal and ethical issues such as\ncopyright infringement. In this paper, we investigate the legal and ethical\nissues of current neural code completion models by answering the following\nquestion: Is my code used to train your neural code completion model? To this\nend, we tailor a membership inference approach (termed CodeMI) that was\noriginally crafted for classification tasks to a more challenging task of code\ncompletion. In particular, since the target code completion models perform as\nopaque black boxes, preventing access to their training data and parameters, we\nopt to train multiple shadow models to mimic their behavior. The acquired\nposteriors from these shadow models are subsequently employed to train a\nmembership classifier. Subsequently, the membership classifier can be\neffectively employed to deduce the membership status of a given code sample\nbased on the output of a target code completion model. We comprehensively\nevaluate the effectiveness of this adapted approach across a diverse array of\nneural code completion models, (i.e., LSTM-based, CodeGPT, CodeGen, and\nStarCoder). Experimental results reveal that the LSTM-based and CodeGPT models\nsuffer the membership leakage issue, which can be easily detected by our\nproposed membership inference approach with an accuracy of 0.842, and 0.730,\nrespectively. Interestingly, our experiments also show that the data membership\nof current large language models of code, e.g., CodeGen and StarCoder, is\ndifficult to detect, leaving ampler space for further improvement. Finally, we\nalso try to explain the findings from the perspective of model memorization.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics\napplications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language\ncomprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such\nas household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these\nmodels to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel\nframework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners\nfor household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner\nthat performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household\nscenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The\ngenerated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are\nsubsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the\noptimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative\nself-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation\nlearning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and\nbootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which\nfurther explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate\nLLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark\nfor household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than\na 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing\nsignificantly improved alignment with human preferences.

Our analysis of nearly 15 million\nTwitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated,\nconfirming their notable presence on the platform.

    "abstract": "A series of graph filtering (GF)-based collaborative filtering (CF) showcases\nstate-of-the-art performance on the recommendation accuracy by using a low-pass\nfilter (LPF) without a training process. However, conventional GF-based CF\napproaches mostly perform matrix decomposition on the item-item similarity\ngraph to realize the ideal LPF, which results in a non-trivial computational\ncost and thus makes them less practical in scenarios where rapid\nrecommendations are essential. In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-based\nCF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CF\nemploys a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrix\ndecompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardware\ncomponents (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-item\nsimilarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our own\npolynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals without\nexplicit matrix decompositions. We demonstrate that Turbo-CF is extremely fast\nyet accurate, achieving a runtime of less than 1 second on real-world benchmark\ndatasets while achieving recommendation accuracies comparable to best\ncompetitors.",

    "abstract": "A recent study has shown that diffusion models are well-suited for modeling\nthe generative process of user-item interactions in recommender systems due to\ntheir denoising nature. However, existing diffusion model-based recommender\nsystems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that contain\ncrucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing this\ngap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering\n(CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals along\nwith multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process adds\nrandom noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising process\naccommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hop\nautoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions.\nCAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module,\nresponsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-item\ninteractions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and\n2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-order\nconnectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that\nCF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods,\nachieving remarkable gains up to 7.29% compared to the best competitor, (b)\nTheoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that the\nembeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the original\ncross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency that\nscales linearly with the number of users or items.",

However, DNNs cannot be\neasily run on devices due to their substantial computing, memory and energy\nrequirements for delivering performance that is comparable to cloud-based ML.\nTherefore, model compression techniques, such as pruning, have been considered.\nExisting pruning methods are problematic for edge ML since they: (1) Create\ncompressed models that have limited runtime performance benefits (using\nunstructured pruning) or compromise the final model accuracy (using structured\npruning), and (2) Require substantial compute resources and time for\nidentifying a suitable compressed DNN model (using neural architecture search).\nIn this paper, we explore a new avenue, referred to as\nPruning-at-Initialization (PaI), using structured pruning to mitigate the above\nproblems. We develop Reconvene, a system for rapidly generating pruned models\nsuited for edge deployments using structured PaI. Reconvene systematically\nidentifies and prunes DNN convolution layers that are least sensitive to\nstructured pruning.

These metrics, along with\nperformance feedback, help surgeons improve and reach practice standards.\nRecent research on the open-source JIGSAWS dataset, which includes both GRS and\nOSATS labels, has focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic data, video,\nor their combination. However, we argue that regressing GRS alone is limiting,\nas it aggregates OSATS scores and overlooks clinically meaningful variations\nduring a surgical trial. To address this, we developed a recurrent transformer\nmodel that tracks a surgeon's performance throughout a session by mapping\nhidden states to six OSATS, derived from kinematic data, using a clinically\nmotivated objective function. These OSATS scores are averaged to predict GRS,\nallowing us to compare our model's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods. We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficients (SCC) demonstrating that\nour model outperforms SOTA using kinematic data (SCC 0.83-0.88), and matches\nperformance with video-based models. Our model also surpasses SOTA in most\ntasks for average OSATS predictions (SCC 0.46-0.70) and specific OSATS (SCC\n0.56-0.95). The generation of pseudo-labels at the segment level translates\nquantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, vital for automated\nsurgical skill assessment pipelines.

We draw on computer science literature to\nsuggest that, in the algorithmic context, 'treatment on the grounds of' needs\nto be understood in terms of two steps: proxy capacity and proxy use. Only\nwhere both elements can be made out can direct discrimination be said to be `on\ngrounds of' a protected characteristic. We analyse the legal conditions of our\nproposed proxy capacity and proxy use tests. Based on this analysis, we discuss\ntechnical approaches and metrics that could be developed or applied to identify\ninherent direct discrimination in algorithmic decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Multi-hop question answering is a knowledge-intensive complex problem. Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) use their Chain of Thoughts (CoT) capability to reason\ncomplex problems step by step, and retrieval-augmentation can effectively\nalleviate factual errors caused by outdated and unknown knowledge in LLMs.\nRecent works have introduced retrieval-augmentation in the CoT reasoning to\nsolve multi-hop question answering. However, these chain methods have the\nfollowing problems: 1) Retrieved irrelevant paragraphs may mislead the\nreasoning; 2) An error in the chain structure may lead to a cascade of errors.\n  In this paper, we propose a dynamic retrieval framework called Tree of\nReviews (ToR), where the root node is the question, and the other nodes are\nparagraphs from retrieval, extending different reasoning paths from the root\nnode to other nodes. Our framework dynamically decides to initiate a new\nsearch, reject, or accept based on the paragraphs on the reasoning paths.\nCompared to related work, we introduce a tree structure to handle each\nretrieved paragraph separately, alleviating the misleading effect of irrelevant\nparagraphs on the reasoning path; the diversity of reasoning path extension\nreduces the impact of a single reasoning error on the whole. We conducted\nexperiments on three different multi-hop question answering datasets. The\nresults show that compared to the baseline methods, ToR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both retrieval and response generation. In\naddition, we propose two tree-based search optimization strategies, pruning and\neffective expansion, to reduce time overhead and increase the diversity of path\nextension. We will release our code.",

We use relaxed real-valued\nbit-widths that are updated using a gradient descent rule, but are otherwise\ndiscretized for all quantization operations. The result is a simple and\nflexible QAT approach for mixed-precision uniform quantization problems.\nCompared to other methods that are generally designed to be run on a pretrained\nnetwork, AdaQAT works well in both training from scratch and fine-tuning\nscenarios.Initial results on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using ResNet20\nand ResNet18 models, respectively, indicate that our method is competitive with\nother state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantization approaches.",

To evaluate the overfitting degree, we further\nintroduce two metrics, i.e, Latent Fisher divergence and Wasserstein metric to\nmeasure the distribution changes of non-customized and customized concept\nrespectively. Drawing from the analysis, we propose Infusion, a T2I\ncustomization method that enables the learning of target concepts to avoid\nbeing constrained by limited training modalities, while preserving\nnon-customized knowledge.

The DAIC-WOZ dataset, interviews\nconducted by a human-controlled virtual agent, has been widely used for this\ntask. Recent studies have reported enhanced performance when incorporating\ninterviewer's prompts into the model. In this work, we hypothesize that this\nimprovement might be mainly due to a bias present in these prompts, rather than\nthe proposed architectures and methods. Through ablation experiments and\nqualitative analysis, we discover that models using interviewer's prompts learn\nto focus on a specific region of the interviews, where questions about past\nexperiences with mental health issues are asked, and use them as discriminative\nshortcuts to detect depressed participants. In contrast, models using\nparticipant responses gather evidence from across the entire interview.\nFinally, to highlight the magnitude of this bias, we achieve a 0.90 F1 score by\nintentionally exploiting it, the highest result reported to date on this\ndataset using only textual information. Our findings underline the need for\ncaution when incorporating interviewers' prompts into models, as they may\ninadvertently learn to exploit targeted prompts, rather than learning to\ncharacterize the language and behavior that are genuinely indicative of the\npatient's mental health condition.",

Current simulated entities tend to lack\nrealistic behavior, and traditional behavior modeling is labor-intensive and\nprone to loss of essential domain knowledge between development steps.\nAdvancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms have\ndemonstrated that agents may learn complex behavior from data, which could be\nfaster and more scalable than manual methods.

We\ndemonstrate our method on scalar predictions with the study of image feature\nrepresentation in the brain from fMRI neural signals and the estimation of\nneural population receptive fields (NSD dataset), as well as on categorical\npredictions with the investigation of handwritten digit recognition (MNIST\ndataset). The resulting IGC attributions show selective patterns, revealing\nunderlying model strategies coherent with their respective objectives.",

    "abstract": "Given the task of positioning a ball-like object to a goal region beyond\ndirect reach, humans can often throw, slide, or rebound objects against the\nwall to attain the goal. However, enabling robots to reason similarly is\nnon-trivial. Existing methods for physical reasoning are data-hungry and\nstruggle with complexity and uncertainty inherent in the real world. This paper\npresents PhyPlan, a novel physics-informed planning framework that combines\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) to enable embodied agents to perform dynamic physical tasks. PhyPlan\nleverages PINNs to simulate and predict outcomes of actions in a fast and\naccurate manner and uses MCTS for planning. It dynamically determines whether\nto consult a PINN-based simulator (coarse but fast) or engage directly with the\nactual environment (fine but slow) to determine optimal policy. Given an unseen\ntask, PhyPlan can infer the sequence of actions and learn the latent\nparameters, resulting in a generalizable approach that can rapidly learn to\nperform novel physical tasks. Evaluation with robots in simulated 3D\nenvironments demonstrates the ability of our approach to solve 3D-physical\nreasoning tasks involving the composition of dynamic skills. Quantitatively,\nPhyPlan excels in several aspects: (i) it achieves lower regret when learning\nnovel tasks compared to the state-of-the-art, (ii) it expedites skill learning\nand enhances the speed of physical reasoning, (iii) it demonstrates higher data\nefficiency compared to a physics un-informed approach.",

As\ne-commerce platforms offer a wide range of services, it's becoming essential to\ndynamically adjust the styles of these auto-generated descriptions. Typical\napproaches to copywriting generation often rely solely on specified product\nattributes, which may result in dull and repetitive content. To tackle this\nissue, we propose to generate copywriting based on customer reviews, as they\nprovide firsthand practical experiences with products, offering a richer source\nof information than just product attributes. We have developed a\nsequence-to-sequence framework, enhanced with reinforcement learning, to\nproduce copywriting that is attractive, authentic, and rich in information. Our\nframework outperforms all existing baseline and zero-shot large language\nmodels, including LLaMA-2-chat-7B and GPT-3.5, in terms of both attractiveness\nand faithfulness.

However, these models encounter\nchallenges when processing text prompts containing multiple entities and\nattributes. The uneven distribution of attention results in the issues of\nentity leakage and attribute misalignment. Training from scratch to address\nthis issue requires numerous labeled data and is resource-consuming. Motivated\nby this, we propose an attribution-focusing mechanism, a training-free\nphase-wise mechanism by modulation of attention for diffusion model. One of our\ncore ideas is to guide the model to concentrate on the corresponding syntactic\ncomponents of the prompt at distinct timesteps. To achieve this, we incorporate\na temperature control mechanism within the early phases of the self-attention\nmodules to mitigate entity leakage issues. An object-focused masking scheme and\na phase-wise dynamic weight control mechanism are integrated into the\ncross-attention modules, enabling the model to discern the affiliation of\nsemantic information between entities more effectively. The experimental\nresults in various alignment scenarios demonstrate that our model attain better\nimage-text alignment with minimal additional computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing\nfinancial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of\ngenerative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job\ndisplacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to\noffset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of\neconomic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented\nscale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and\nexamines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures\nthat would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job\nsecurity and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to\nundertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour\nunderutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a\nmoderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour\nunderutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable\nincome by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index\nby 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per\ncapita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at\nleast a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary.\nResults demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold\nbeyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in\nconsumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the\nurgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study\nunderscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work\ntogether to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard\nthe Mental Wealth of nations.",

Prior research treats class-level\ngeneration as an isolated task, neglecting the intricate dependencies &\ninteractions that characterize real-world software environments. To address\nthis gap, we introduce RepoClassBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to\nrigorously evaluate LLMs in generating complex, class-level code within\nreal-world repositories. RepoClassBench includes \"Natural Language to Class\ngeneration\" tasks across Java, Python & C# from a selection of repositories. We\nensure that each class in our dataset not only has cross-file dependencies\nwithin the repository but also includes corresponding test cases to verify its\nfunctionality. We find that current models struggle with the realistic\nchallenges posed by our benchmark, primarily due to their limited exposure to\nrelevant repository contexts.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in\naligning language models with human preferences. While the significance of\ndataset quality is generally recognized, explicit investigations into its\nimpact within the RLHF framework, to our knowledge, have been limited. This\npaper addresses the issue of text quality within the preference dataset by\nfocusing on direct preference optimization (DPO), an increasingly adopted\nreward-model-free RLHF method. We confirm that text quality significantly\ninfluences the performance of models optimized with DPO more than those\noptimized with reward-model-based RLHF. Building on this new insight, we\npropose an extension of DPO, termed filtered direct preference optimization\n(fDPO). fDPO uses a trained reward model to monitor the quality of texts within\nthe preference dataset during DPO training. Samples of lower quality are\ndiscarded based on comparisons with texts generated by the model being\noptimized, resulting in a more accurate dataset. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that fDPO enhances the final model performance. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/filtered-dpo.",

    "abstract": "A primary function of back-propagation is to compute both the gradient of\nhidden representations and parameters for optimization with gradient descent.\nTraining large models requires high computational costs due to their vast\nparameter sizes. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim to\ntrain smaller auxiliary models to save computational space, they still present\ncomputational overheads, especially in Fine-Tuning as a Service (FTaaS) for\nnumerous users. We introduce Collaborative Adaptation (ColA) with Gradient\nLearning (GL), a parameter-free, model-agnostic fine-tuning approach that\ndecouples the computation of the gradient of hidden representations and\nparameters. In comparison to PEFT methods, ColA facilitates more cost-effective\nFTaaS by offloading the computation of the gradient to low-cost devices. We\nalso provide a theoretical analysis of ColA and experimentally demonstrate that\nColA can perform on par or better than existing PEFT methods on various\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning across multiple\nclients. In most FL work, all clients train a single learning task. However,\nthe recent proliferation of FL applications may increasingly require multiple\nFL tasks to be trained simultaneously, sharing clients' computing and\ncommunication resources, which we call Multiple-Model Federated Learning\n(MMFL). Current MMFL algorithms use naive average-based client-task allocation\nschemes that can lead to unfair performance when FL tasks have heterogeneous\ndifficulty levels, e.g., tasks with larger models may need more rounds and data\nto train. Just as naively allocating resources to generic computing jobs with\nheterogeneous resource needs can lead to unfair outcomes, naive allocation of\nclients to FL tasks can lead to unfairness, with some tasks having excessively\nlong training times, or lower converged accuracies. Furthermore, in the FL\nsetting, since clients are typically not paid for their training effort, we\nface a further challenge that some clients may not even be willing to train\nsome tasks, e.g., due to high computational costs, which may exacerbate\nunfairness in training outcomes across tasks. We address both challenges by\nfirstly designing FedFairMMFL, a difficulty-aware algorithm that dynamically\nallocates clients to tasks in each training round. We provide guarantees on\nairness and FedFairMMFL's convergence rate. We then propose a novel auction\ndesign that incentivizes clients to train multiple tasks, so as to fairly\ndistribute clients' training efforts across the tasks. We show how our\nfairness-based learning and incentive mechanisms impact training convergence\nand finally evaluate our algorithm with multiple sets of learning tasks on real\nworld datasets.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt\npre-trained models for specific applications. While methods like LoRA have\neffectively addressed GPU memory constraints during fine-tuning, their\nperformance often falls short, especially in multi-task scenarios. In contrast,\nMixture-of-Expert (MoE) models, such as Mixtral 8x7B, demonstrate remarkable\nperformance in multi-task learning scenarios while maintaining a reduced\nparameter count. However, the resource requirements of these MoEs remain\nchallenging, particularly for consumer-grade GPUs with less than 24GB memory.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose MixLoRA, an approach to construct a\nresource-efficient sparse MoE model based on LoRA. MixLoRA inserts multiple\nLoRA-based experts within the feed-forward network block of a frozen\npre-trained dense model and employs a commonly used top-k router. Unlike other\nLoRA-based MoE methods, MixLoRA enhances model performance by utilizing\nindependent attention-layer LoRA adapters. Additionally, an auxiliary load\nbalance loss is employed to address the imbalance problem of the router. Our\nevaluations show that MixLoRA improves about 9% accuracy compared to\nstate-of-the-art PEFT methods in multi-task learning scenarios. We also propose\na new high-throughput framework to alleviate the computation and memory\nbottlenecks during the training and inference of MOE models. This framework\nreduces GPU memory consumption by 40% and token computation latency by 30%\nduring both training and inference.",

    "abstract": "Fact tracing seeks to identify specific training examples that serve as the\nknowledge source for a given query. Existing approaches to fact tracing rely on\nassessing the similarity between each training sample and the query along a\ncertain dimension, such as lexical similarity, gradient, or embedding space.\nHowever, these methods fall short of effectively distinguishing between samples\nthat are merely relevant and those that actually provide supportive evidence\nfor the information sought by the query. This limitation often results in\nsuboptimal effectiveness. Moreover, these approaches necessitate the\nexamination of the similarity of individual training points for each query,\nimposing significant computational demands and creating a substantial barrier\nfor practical applications. This paper introduces FASTTRACK, a novel approach\nthat harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate\nsupportive evidence for queries and at the same time clusters the training\ndatabase towards a reduced extent for LLMs to trace facts. Our experiments show\nthat FASTTRACK substantially outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and\nefficiency, achieving more than 100\\% improvement in F1 score over the\nstate-of-the-art methods while being X33 faster than \\texttt{TracIn}.",

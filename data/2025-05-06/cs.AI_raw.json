    "abstract": "Serving large language models (LLMs) is expensive, especially for providers\nhosting many models, making cost reduction essential. The unique workload\npatterns of serving multiple LLMs (i.e., multi-LLM serving) create new\nopportunities and challenges for this task. The long-tail popularity of models\nand their long idle periods present opportunities to improve utilization\nthrough GPU sharing. However, existing GPU sharing systems lack the ability to\nadjust their resource allocation and sharing policies at runtime, making them\nineffective at meeting latency service-level objectives (SLOs) under rapidly\nfluctuating workloads.\n  This paper presents Prism, a multi-LLM serving system that unleashes the full\npotential of GPU sharing to achieve both cost efficiency and SLO attainment. At\nits core, Prism tackles a key limitation of existing\nsystems$\\unicode{x2014}$the lack of $\\textit{cross-model memory coordination}$,\nwhich is essential for flexibly sharing GPU memory across models under dynamic\nworkloads. Prism achieves this with two key designs. First, it supports\non-demand memory allocation by dynamically mapping physical to virtual memory\npages, allowing flexible memory redistribution among models that space- and\ntime-share a GPU. Second, it improves memory efficiency through a two-level\nscheduling policy that dynamically adjusts sharing strategies based on models'\nruntime demands. Evaluations on real-world traces show that Prism achieves more\nthan $2\\times$ cost savings and $3.3\\times$ SLO attainment compared to\nstate-of-the-art systems.",

    "abstract": "The need to explain predictive models is well-established in modern machine\nlearning. However, beyond model interpretability, understanding pre-processing\nmethods is equally essential. Understanding how data modifications impact model\nperformance improvements and potential biases and promoting a reliable pipeline\nis mandatory for developing robust machine learning solutions. Isolation Forest\n(iForest) is a widely used technique for outlier detection that performs well.\nIts effectiveness increases with the number of tree-based learners. However,\nthis also complicates the explanation of outlier selection and the decision\nboundaries for inliers. This research introduces a novel Explainable AI (XAI)\nmethod, tackling the problem of global explainability. In detail, it aims to\noffer a global explanation for outlier detection to address its opaque nature.\nOur approach is based on the Decision Predicate Graph (DPG), which clarifies\nthe logic of ensemble methods and provides both insights and a graph-based\nmetric to explain how samples are identified as outliers using the proposed\nInlier-Outlier Propagation Score (IOP-Score). Our proposal enhances iForest's\nexplainability and provides a comprehensive view of the decision-making\nprocess, detailing which features contribute to outlier identification and how\nthe model utilizes them.

    "abstract": "Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor\nskills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers, such\nas climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile movements\nwith simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of\nmotion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of\nacquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based\nAugmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a\nframework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to\niteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain\ntraversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small\ndataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is\nthen used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these\ngenerated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or\ndiscontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking\ncontroller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then\nadded to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator\nin the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the\ncapabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile\nmodels for interacting with complex environments. PARC provides an effective\napproach to develop controllers for agile terrain traversal, which bridges the\ngap between the scarcity of motion data and the need for versatile character\ncontrollers.",

    "abstract": "If AI systems match or exceed human capabilities on a wide range of tasks, it\nmay become difficult for humans to efficiently judge their actions -- making it\nhard to use human feedback to steer them towards desirable traits. One proposed\nsolution is to leverage another superhuman system to point out flaws in the\nsystem's outputs via a debate. This paper outlines the value of debate for AI\nsafety, as well as the assumptions and further research required to make debate\nwork. It does so by sketching an ``alignment safety case'' -- an argument that\nan AI system will not autonomously take actions which could lead to egregious\nharm, despite being able to do so. The sketch focuses on the risk of an AI R\\&D\nagent inside an AI company sabotaging research, for example by producing false\nresults. To prevent this, the agent is trained via debate, subject to\nexploration guarantees, to teach the system to be honest. Honesty is maintained\nthroughout deployment via online training. The safety case rests on four key\nclaims: (1) the agent has become good at the debate game, (2) good performance\nin the debate game implies that the system is mostly honest, (3) the system\nwill not become significantly less honest during deployment, and (4) the\ndeployment context is tolerant of some errors.

This paper explores\nwhether Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer an alternative approach for GPU\nperformance prediction without relying on hardware. We frame the problem as a\nroofline classification task: given the source code of a GPU kernel and the\nhardware specifications of a target GPU, can an LLM predict whether the GPU\nkernel is compute-bound or bandwidth-bound?\n  For this study, we build a balanced dataset of 340 GPU kernels, obtained from\nHeCBench benchmark and written in CUDA and OpenMP, along with their\nground-truth labels obtained via empirical GPU profiling. We evaluate LLMs\nacross four scenarios: (1) with access to profiling data of the kernel source,\n(2) zero-shot with source code only, (3) few-shot with code and label pairs,\nand (4) fine-tuned on a small custom dataset.\n  Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs have a strong understanding of\nthe Roofline model, achieving 100% classification accuracy when provided with\nexplicit profiling data. We also find that reasoning-capable LLMs significantly\noutperform standard LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings, achieving up to 64%\naccuracy on GPU source codes, without profiling information. Lastly, we find\nthat LLM fine-tuning will require much more data than what we currently have\navailable.\n  This work is among the first to use LLMs for source-level roofline\nperformance prediction via classification, and illustrates their potential to\nguide optimization efforts when runtime profiling is infeasible. Our findings\nsuggest that with better datasets and prompt strategies, LLMs could become\npractical tools for HPC performance analysis and performance portability.",

Yet, most existing open-source research\nconcentrates on training text-only reasoning models, with evaluations limited\nto mainly mathematical and general-domain tasks. Therefore, it remains unclear\nhow to effectively extend reasoning capabilities beyond text input and general\ndomains. This paper explores a fundamental research question: Is reasoning\ngeneralizable across modalities and domains? Our findings support an\naffirmative answer: General-domain text-based post-training can enable such\nstrong generalizable reasoning. Leveraging this finding, we introduce\nX-Reasoner, a vision-language model post-trained solely on general-domain text\nfor generalizable reasoning, using a two-stage approach: an initial supervised\nfine-tuning phase with distilled long chain-of-thoughts, followed by\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Experiments show that\nX-Reasoner successfully transfers reasoning capabilities to both multimodal and\nout-of-domain settings, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models trained\nwith in-domain and multimodal data across various general and medical\nbenchmarks (Figure 1). Additionally, we find that X-Reasoner's performance in\nspecialized domains can be further enhanced through continued training on\ndomain-specific text-only data. Building upon this, we introduce\nX-Reasoner-Med, a medical-specialized variant that achieves new state of the\nart on numerous text-only and multimodal medical benchmarks.",

However, the sensor characteristics, proximity\nto the structure, hard-to-reach access, and environmental conditions often\nlimit the resolution of the datasets. A few studies used super-resolution\ntechniques to address the problem of low-resolution images. Nevertheless, these\ntechniques were observed to increase computational cost and false alarms of\ndistress detection due to the consideration of all the infrastructure images\ni.e., positive and negative distress classes. In order to address the\npre-processing of false alarm and achieve efficient super-resolution, this\nstudy developed a framework consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN)\nand efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network (ESPCNN). CNN accurately\nclassified both the classes. ESPCNN, which is the lightweight super-resolution\ntechnique, generated high-resolution infrastructure image of positive distress\nobtained from CNN. The ESPCNN outperformed bicubic interpolation in all the\nevaluation metrics for super-resolution. Based on the performance metrics, the\ncombination of CNN and ESPCNN was observed to be effective in preprocessing the\ninfrastructure images with negative distress, reducing the computational cost\nand false alarms in the next step of super-resolution. The visual inspection\nshowed that EPSCNN is able to capture crack propagation, complex geometry of\neven minor cracks.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting\ndiagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to\nlanguage-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of\nremote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and\npatients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in\nmedical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while\npreserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains\nunknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management\nperformance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a\nnew capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this\nprecisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system\nimplements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is\ndynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states\nand evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by\nuncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal\nhistory-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE\nto primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of\nchat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation\nscenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of\nclinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric\nassessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like\nhistory-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and\nempathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9\nmultimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The\nresults show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but\nreal-world translation needs further research.",

This study explores\nwhether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We\nuse a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either\ncooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories\nhighlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences\nnegotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do\nnarratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share\nthe same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers\ngrow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that\nstory-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success\nrates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By\ncontrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those\nagents primed toward self-interest prevail.

While traditional rule-based scheduling algorithms dominate the\ncurrent deployments of HPC systems, the increasing heterogeneity and scale of\nthose systems is expected to challenge the efficiency and flexibility of those\nalgorithms in minimizing job wait time and maximizing utilization. Recent\nresearch efforts have focused on leveraging advancements in Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to develop more adaptable and intelligent scheduling strategies.\nRecent RL-based scheduling approaches have explored a range of algorithms, from\nDeep Q-Networks (DQN) to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and more recently,\nhybrid methods that integrate Graph Neural Networks with RL techniques.\nHowever, a common limitation across these methods is their reliance on\nrelatively small datasets, and these methods face scalability issues when using\nlarge datasets.

Inspired by\nprevious study, we constructed a task taxonomy along with a carefully curated\nset of test samples to conduct a comprehensive qualitative test. Benefiting\nfrom GPT-4o's powerful multimodal comprehension, its image-generation process\ndemonstrates abilities surpassing those of traditional image-generation tasks.\nThus, regarding the dimensions of model capabilities, we evaluate its\nperformance across six task categories: traditional image generation tasks,\ndiscriminative tasks, knowledge-based generation, commonsense-based generation,\nspatially-aware image generation, and temporally-aware image generation. These\ntasks not only assess the quality and conditional alignment of the model's\noutputs but also probe deeper into GPT-4o's understanding of real-world\nconcepts. Our results reveal that GPT-4o performs impressively well in\ngeneral-purpose synthesis tasks, showing strong capabilities in text-to-image\ngeneration, visual stylization, and low-level image processing. However,\nsignificant limitations remain in its ability to perform precise spatial\nreasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and consistent temporal prediction.\nFurthermore, when faced with knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios,\nsuch as scientific illustrations or mathematical plots, the model often\nexhibits hallucinations, factual errors, or structural inconsistencies.

A common approach to these problems involves relaxing the norm\nconstraint via Lagrangian relaxation, transforming it into a regularization\nterm in the objective function. A particularly challenging class includes the\nzero-norm function, which promotes sparsity in statistical parameter\nestimation. Most existing exact methods for solving these problems introduce\nbinary variables and artificial bounds to reformulate them as\nhigher-dimensional mixed-integer programs, solvable by standard solvers. Other\nexact approaches exploit specific structural properties of the objective,\nmaking them difficult to generalize across different problem types.

Despite significant progress in retinal vessel\nsegmentation with the advancement of Neural Networks, there are still\nchallenges to overcome. Specifically, retinal vessel segmentation aims to\npredict the class label for every pixel within a fundus image, with a primary\nfocus on intra-image discrimination, making it vital for models to extract more\ndiscriminative features. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on\nminimizing the difference between the output from the decoder and the label,\nbut ignore fully using feature-level fine-grained representations from the\nencoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel Attention U-shaped\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network named AttUKAN along with a novel Label-guided\nPixel-wise Contrastive Loss for retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we\nimplement Attention Gates into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to enhance model\nsensitivity by suppressing irrelevant feature activations and model\ninterpretability by non-linear modeling of KAN blocks. Additionally, we also\ndesign a novel Label-guided Pixel-wise Contrastive Loss to supervise our\nproposed AttUKAN to extract more discriminative features by distinguishing\nbetween foreground vessel-pixel pairs and background pairs. Experiments are\nconducted across four public datasets including DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF\nand our private dataset. AttUKAN achieves F1 scores of 82.50%, 81.14%, 81.34%,\n80.21% and 80.09%, along with MIoU scores of 70.24%, 68.64%, 68.59%, 67.21% and\n66.94% in the above datasets, which are the highest compared to 11 networks for\nretinal vessel segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our\nAttUKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing retinal\nvessel segmentation methods.

However, the existing speech models still\nexperience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming,\nwhich poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we\npropose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token\ngeneration. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token\nPrediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens\nwithin a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference\nbut also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in\nstreaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is\nexplored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To\nour knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable\nof generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time\nconversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully\nreproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B\nparameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of\nsimilar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition\n(ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.",

    "abstract": "Action customization involves generating videos where the subject performs\nactions dictated by input control signals. Current methods use pose-guided or\nglobal motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial\nstructure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing\nadaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference\nvideo to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows\nfor variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject\nof the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity\nconsistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure\nadaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter,\na lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and\nconsistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance\nconsistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our\nobservations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to\nmotion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different\ntimesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike\nexisting methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly\nachieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with\ndiverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints.

Our algorithm\nintegrates optimism, off-policy critic estimation targeting the optimal\nQ-function, and rare-switching policy resets.\n  We extend this to the setting of Hybrid RL, showing that initializing the\ncritic with offline data yields sample efficiency gains compared to purely\noffline or online RL. Further, utilizing access to offline data, we provide a\n\\textit{non-optimistic} provably efficient actor-critic algorithm that only\nadditionally requires $N_{\\text{off}} \\geq c_{\\text{off}}^*dH^4/\\epsilon^2$ in\nexchange for omitting optimism, where $c_{\\text{off}}^*$ is the single-policy\nconcentrability coefficient and $N_{\\text{off}}$ is the number of offline\nsamples.

    "abstract": "As Radio Access Networks (RAN) evolve toward AI-native architectures,\nintelligent modules such as xApps and rApps are expected to make increasingly\nautonomous decisions across scheduling, mobility, and resource management\ndomains. However, these agents remain fundamentally stateless, treating each\ndecision as isolated, lacking any persistent memory of prior events or\noutcomes. This reactive behavior constrains optimization, especially in\nenvironments where network dynamics exhibit episodic or recurring patterns. In\nthis work, we propose RAN Cortex, a memory-augmented architecture that enables\ncontextual recall in AI-based RAN decision systems. RAN Cortex introduces a\nmodular layer composed of four elements: a context encoder that transforms\nnetwork state into high-dimensional embeddings, a vector-based memory store of\npast network episodes, a recall engine to retrieve semantically similar\nsituations, and a policy interface that supplies historical context to AI\nagents in real time or near-real time. We formalize the retrieval-augmented\ndecision problem in the RAN, present a system architecture compatible with\nO-RAN interfaces, and analyze feasible deployments within the Non-RT and\nNear-RT RIC domains. Through illustrative use cases such as stadium traffic\nmitigation and mobility management in drone corridors, we demonstrate how\ncontextual memory improves adaptability, continuity, and overall RAN\nintelligence. This work introduces memory as a missing primitive in AI-native\nRAN designs and provides a framework to enable \"learning agents\" without the\nneed for retraining or centralized inference",

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for\nusers. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common\nphenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users\nor items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with\npositive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such\nunfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of\ncounterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build\na causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score.\nDuring the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to\nmitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using\ncounterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the\nresults validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating\nprediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment\nbias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ\ncounterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of\nuser-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts\nand contextual captioning. However, humans typically explore and reason over\nrelations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information\nto achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end,\nexisting methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks\nmulti-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on\nthe limited training data, their models overlook the relations between\ndifferent personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments\nmainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to\nrecognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new\ndataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each\nset includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more\nstructured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an\nMLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard\ngraph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic\nspace. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types:\nmultiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in\nboth open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to\nevaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of\npersonalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and\nother competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns\npersonalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses,\nachieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods.

    "abstract": "Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an\nalternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory\nunits outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object\ndiscovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for\nthese oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto\nequation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this\nresearch note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes\noscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism\nbetween them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and\nthreshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold\nunits model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate\ninformation exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between\nthese two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical\nsystems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to\nHopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a\nspecific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems\ncan be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model,\nwhich also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible.\nNotably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction\nto the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed\neither as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for\nfine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization\nof this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.",

In the context of optimizing\nimperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage,\nexisting methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients\nthroughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To\naddress this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial\noptimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward\nregions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information\npropagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in\nstronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and\nsample-specific scenarios.

Recently, GenARM (Xu et al., 2025) first independently\ntrains Autoregressive Reward Models (ARMs) for each preference dimension\nwithout awareness of each other, then combines their outputs based on\nuser-specific preference vectors during inference to achieve multi-objective\ntest-time alignment, leading to two key limitations: the need for\n\\textit{multiple} ARMs increases the inference cost, and the separate training\nof ARMs causes the misalignment between the guided generation and the user\npreferences. To address these issues, we propose Preference-aware ARM (PARM), a\nsingle unified ARM trained across all preference dimensions. PARM uses our\nproposed Preference-Aware Bilinear Low-Rank Adaptation (PBLoRA), which employs\na bilinear form to condition the ARM on preference vectors, enabling it to\nachieve precise control over preference trade-offs during inference.\nExperiments demonstrate that PARM reduces inference costs and achieves better\nalignment with preference vectors compared with existing methods. Additionally,\nPARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger\nfrozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment\naccessible with limited computing resources.

These discrete\nobservation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant\nchallenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we\nfirst formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially\nobservable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard\nDec-POMDP.

This task plays a key role in\nvarious real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR,\ngaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for\nproviding immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However,\nachieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the\ncomplexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human\nposes. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in\nPGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive\napplications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating\nsign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are\nrequired. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial\nstep toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables\nfaster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the\nproposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space,\nmaking it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed\nand quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person\nImage Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used\nDeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves\nnear-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art models. Our methodology trades off a slight, acceptable\ndecrease in generated-image accuracy for over a twofold increase in generation\nspeed, thereby ensuring real-time performance.",

    "abstract": "Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic\ngraphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have\nextended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more\nflexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in\ntraining GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including\nintractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training,\nand the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present\nwork proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows\n(EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage\nergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined\ntransformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable\nflow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving\ncross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It\nis designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate\nIL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using\nthe KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning\nexperiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.",

When different proprietary reasoning\nmodels (RMs), such as those by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI,\nare given the same complex request, they often produce divergent results due to\nvariations in training and inference. This paper proposes a novel consensus\nmechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge\nthese outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph\nconsensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and\nvirtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an\narchitectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange\nand update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy\nand confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority\nvoting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every\nmodel. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI\nensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in\nreducing nonfactual outputs. Preliminary considerations for implementation,\nevaluation criteria for convergence and accuracy, and potential challenges are\ndiscussed.

    "abstract": "As deep learning models expand, the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm has\nbecome the standard approach for handling various downstream tasks. However,\nshared parameters can lead to diminished performance when dealing with complex\ndatasets involving multiple tasks. While introducing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmethods has alleviated this issue to some extent, it also significantly\nincreases the number of parameters required for fine-tuning and training time,\nintroducing greater parameter redundancy. To address these challenges, we\npropose a method for allocating expert numbers based on parameter sensitivity\nLoRA-SMoE (A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for\nEfficient Fine-Tuning). This method rapidly assesses the sensitivity of\ndifferent tasks to parameters by sampling a small amount of data and using\ngradient information. It then adaptively allocates expert numbers within a\ngiven budget. The process maintains comparable memory consumption to LoRA\n(Low-Rank Adaptation) while ensuring an efficient and resource-friendly\nfine-tuning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to SOTA\nfine-tuning methods, our LoRA-SMoE approach can enhance model performance while\nreducing the number of trainable parameters. This significantly improves model\nperformance in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, due to its\nefficient parameter sensitivity evaluation mechanism, LoRA-SMoE requires\nminimal computational overhead to optimize expert allocation, making it\nparticularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources.

Moreover, QR codes can encode\nvarious types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment\ninformation, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security\nconcerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing\ndetection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without\nextracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign\nQR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models,\nincluding Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,\nLightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of\n0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection. Through feature\nimportance analysis, we identify key visual indicators of malicious intent and\nrefine our feature set by removing non-informative pixels, improving\nperformance to an AUC of 0.9133 with a reduced feature space. Our findings\nreveal that the structural features of QR code correlate strongly with phishing\nrisk. This work establishes a foundation for quishing mitigation and highlights\nthe potential of direct QR analysis as a critical layer in modern phishing\ndefenses.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks\nsuch as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence.

However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world\napplications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in\ncomplex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while\ntransformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural\nmemory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments\n-- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must\naugment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems.

According to the evaluation results from\neight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in\nidentifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90%\nin most domains. Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes\nwere observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique\ncontributions to specific abilities. These findings confirm that the proposed\napproach is effective in identifying children's development across various free\nplay settings. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and\nlearning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental\ntrajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning\nand enhance early childhood education practices.",

The model\ndetermines visual sensory precisions based on both current environmental\nbeliefs and sensory input, influencing attentional allocation in both covert\nand overt modalities. To test the effectiveness of the model, we analyze its\nbehavior in the Posner cueing task and a simple target focus task using\ntwo-dimensional(2D) visual data. Reaction times are measured to investigate the\ninterplay between exogenous and endogenous attention, as well as valid and\ninvalid cueing. The results show that exogenous and valid cues generally lead\nto faster reaction times compared to endogenous and invalid cues. Furthermore,\nthe model exhibits behavior similar to inhibition of return, where previously\nattended locations become suppressed after a specific cue-target onset\nasynchrony interval. Lastly, we investigate different aspects of overt\nattention and show that involuntary, reflexive saccades occur faster than\nintentional ones, but at the expense of adaptability.",

Recent RLVR works that operate under the\nzero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still\ndepend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training.\nThe scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the\nlong-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already\nevident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a\nhypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by\nhumans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system.

Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner\n(AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability\nby using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and\nverify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide\nopen-ended yet grounded learning.

This report introduces Persistent Workflow\nPrompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering\nmethodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces\n(zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical\nanalysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical,\nmodular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis\nworkflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of\nmeta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying\nexpert review workflows, including tacit knowledge.

Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM\nidentifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM\ninput bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from\nevidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing\nquantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and\nassessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate\nreplication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs\nof interactive chats as supplementary resources.

In this work, our aim is to\nexploit the high-resolution capabilities of the TanDEM-X mission to map forests\nat 6 m. The goal is to overcome the intrinsic limitations posed by\nmidresolution products, which affect, e.g., the detection of narrow roads\nwithin vegetated areas and the precise delineation of forested regions\ncontours. To cope with the lack of extended reliable reference datasets at such\na high resolution, we investigate self-supervised learning techniques for\nextracting highly informative representations from the input features, followed\nby a supervised training step with a significantly smaller number of reliable\nlabels. A 1 m resolution forest/non-forest reference map over Pennsylvania,\nUSA, allows for comparing different training approaches for the development of\nan effective forest mapping framework with limited labeled samples. We select\nthe best-performing approach over this test region and apply it in a real-case\nforest mapping scenario over the Amazon rainforest, where only very few labeled\ndata at high resolution are available. In this challenging scenario, the\nproposed self-supervised framework significantly enhances the classification\naccuracy with respect to fully-supervised methods, trained using the same\namount of labeled data, representing an extremely promising starting point for\nlarge-scale, very high-resolution forest mapping with TanDEM-X data.",

    "abstract": "We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel\napproach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot\nmanipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using\nonly camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging\ntasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly\nconstrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping\nwith a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns\nthese tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large\ndatasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering\nusing evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This\nsteering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle\navoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On\nconstrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points\nand reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy\nsuccess by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of\n20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success.

    "abstract": "Natural language goes beyond dryly describing visual content. It contains\nrich abstract concepts to express feeling, creativity and properties that\ncannot be directly perceived. Yet, current research in Vision Language Models\n(VLMs) has not shed light on abstract-oriented language. Our research breaks\nnew ground by uncovering its wide presence and under-estimated value, with\nextensive analysis. Particularly, we focus our investigation on the fashion\ndomain, a highly-representative field with abstract expressions. By analyzing\nrecent large-scale multimodal fashion datasets, we find that abstract terms\nhave a dominant presence, rivaling the concrete ones, providing novel\ninformation, and being useful in the retrieval task. However, a critical\nchallenge emerges: current general-purpose or fashion-specific VLMs are\npre-trained with databases that lack sufficient abstract words in their text\ncorpora, thus hindering their ability to effectively represent\nabstract-oriented language. We propose a training-free and model-agnostic\nmethod, Abstract-to-Concrete Translator (ACT), to shift abstract\nrepresentations towards well-represented concrete ones in the VLM latent space,\nusing pre-trained models and existing multimodal databases. On the\ntext-to-image retrieval task, despite being training-free, ACT outperforms the\nfine-tuned VLMs in both same- and cross-dataset settings, exhibiting its\neffectiveness with a strong generalization capability.

To address the limitations of traditional\ntechniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a\ndetection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video\n\"Yupan\" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method\nintegrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference\nmechanisms.

Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte\nsequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral\nenergy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext\nsemantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests\nfeatures of military communication protocols.

This is achieved\nby enforcing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations\nafter encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm often\nlimits the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by\ncreating performance trade-offs between high-level invariance-demanding tasks\nsuch as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks.\nIn this work, we proposes \\emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling framework that\nintroduces architectural inductive biases into joint-embedding predictive\narchitectures to resolve this trade-off. Without relying on dual equivariance\npredictors or loss terms, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally\nsegregated representations: one equivariant to specified transformations and\nanother invariant to them. To do so, our model processes short sequences of\ndifferent views (observations) of inputs. Each encoded view is concatenated\nwith an embedding of the relative transformation (action) that produces the\nnext observation in the sequence. These view-action pairs are passed through a\ntransformer encoder that outputs an aggregate representation. A predictor head\nthen conditions this aggregate representation on the upcoming action to predict\nthe representation of the next observation. Empirically, seq-JEPA demonstrates\nstrong performance on both equivariant and invariant benchmarks without\nsacrificing one for the other.

    "abstract": "Hindsight relabeling is a powerful tool for overcoming sparsity in\ngoal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), especially in certain domains\nsuch as navigation and locomotion. However, hindsight relabeling can struggle\nin object-centric domains. For example, suppose that the goal space consists of\na robotic arm pushing a particular target block to a goal location. In this\ncase, hindsight relabeling will give high rewards to any trajectory that does\nnot interact with the block. However, these behaviors are only useful when the\nobject is already at the goal -- an extremely rare case in practice. A dataset\ndominated by these kinds of trajectories can complicate learning and lead to\nfailures. In object-centric domains, one key intuition is that meaningful\ntrajectories are often characterized by object-object interactions such as\npushing the block with the gripper. To leverage this intuition, we introduce\nHindsight Relabeling using Interactions (HInt), which combines interactions\nwith hindsight relabeling to improve the sample efficiency of downstream RL.\nHowever because interactions do not have a consensus statistical definition\ntractable for downstream GCRL, we propose a definition of interactions based on\nthe concept of null counterfactual: a cause object is interacting with a target\nobject if, in a world where the cause object did not exist, the target object\nwould have different transition dynamics. We leverage this definition to infer\ninteractions in Null Counterfactual Interaction Inference (NCII), which uses a\n\"nulling'' operation with a learned model to infer interactions. NCII is able\nto achieve significantly improved interaction inference accuracy in both simple\nlinear dynamics domains and dynamic robotic domains in Robosuite, Robot Air\nHockey, and Franka Kitchen and HInt improves sample efficiency by up to 4x.",

To address this issue, a variety of model compression\ntechniques have been proposed, among which knowledge distillation (KD) stands\nout for its strong empirical performance. The KD contains two concurrent\nprocesses: (i) matching the outputs of a large, pre-trained teacher network and\na lightweight student network, and (ii) training the student to solve its\ndesignated downstream task.

Cleaning this corrupted data can\nrequire substantial manual effort from human experts, which can be a costly and\ntime-consuming process. Previous data-driven motion cleanup methods offer the\npromise of automating this cleanup process, but often require in-domain paired\ncorrupted-to-clean training data. Constructing such paired datasets requires\naccess to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often\nnecessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a\nsimple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from\nunpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method\nis the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated\nthrough manual labeling or heuristic algorithms and enable training of\nquality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality.\nAt test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using\nthe quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple\ndiffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate\nmodel, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We\ndemonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup\nmodels on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to\nSoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion\nartifacts.

Since genes are the foundation of cellular life,\nbuilding gene regulatory networks (GRN) is essential to understand and predict\nthe effects of genetic perturbations. However, current methods fail to fully\nleverage gene-related information, and solely rely on simple evaluation metrics\nto construct coarse-grained GRN.

    "abstract": "The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial\nIntelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities:\ntext, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these\nbreakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of\nadversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit\nvulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat\namplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or\nacross these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types\nremains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners\nadopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications,\nit's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive\nactions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial\nattacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This\nsurvey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how\nmultimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this\nsurvey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the\nmultimodal world.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a novel approach for\ndynamic nonprehensile manipulation tasks that formulates planning as latent\nspace inference, effectively learned from human demonstration videos. Our\nmethod addresses key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a\nprincipled variational replanning framework that maintains temporal consistency\nwhile efficiently adapting to environmental changes. LAP employs Bayesian\nupdating in latent space to incrementally refine plans as new observations\nbecome available, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency\nand real-time adaptability. We bridge the embodiment gap between humans and\nrobots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate\nkinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations.\nExperimental evaluations across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nexisting approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness, and energy\nefficiency, particularly in dynamic adaptation scenarios. Our approach enables\nrobots to perform complex interactions with human-like adaptability while\nproviding an expandable framework applicable to diverse robotic platforms using\nthe same human demonstration videos.",

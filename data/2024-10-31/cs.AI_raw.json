Traditional performance metrics such as\naccuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases\nwhere models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural\nnetworks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust,\ndisbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing\nopinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where\npost-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed\nframework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with\npotential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Humans have the ability to reason about geometric patterns in images and\nscenes from a young age. However, developing large multimodal models (LMMs)\ncapable of similar reasoning remains a challenge, highlighting the need for\nrobust evaluation methods to assess these capabilities. We introduce \\Turtle, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate LMMs' capacity to interpret geometric patterns\n-- given visual examples, textual instructions, or both -- and generate precise\ncode outputs. Inspired by turtle geometry, a notion used to teach children\nfoundational coding and geometric concepts, TurtleBench features tasks with\npatterned shapes that have underlying algorithmic logic. Our evaluation reveals\nthat leading LMMs struggle significantly with these tasks, with GPT-4o\nachieving only 19\\% accuracy on the simplest tasks and few-shot prompting only\nmarginally improves their performance ($<2\\%$). \\Turtle highlights the gap\nbetween human and AI performance in intuitive and visual geometrical\nunderstanding, setting the stage for future research in this area. \\Turtle\nstands as one of the few benchmarks to evaluate the integration of visual\nunderstanding and code generation capabilities in LMMs, setting the stage for\nfuture research.

These models are able to describe and\ngenerate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit\nsurprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting,\nlocalization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with\nnear perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes\nand failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in\ncognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a\nshared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct\nentities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the\nuse of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the\npuzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to\nthe binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the\nlimitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "An adversarial example is a modified input image designed to cause a Machine\nLearning (ML) model to make a mistake; these perturbations are often invisible\nor subtle to human observers and highlight vulnerabilities in a model's ability\nto generalize from its training data. Several adversarial attacks can create\nsuch examples, each with a different perspective, effectiveness, and\nperceptibility of changes. Conversely, defending against such adversarial\nattacks improves the robustness of ML models in image processing and other\ndomains of deep learning. Most defence mechanisms require either a level of\nmodel awareness, changes to the model, or access to a comprehensive set of\nadversarial examples during training, which is impractical. Another option is\nto use an auxiliary model in a preprocessing manner without changing the\nprimary model. This study presents a practical and effective solution -- using\npredictive coding networks (PCnets) as an auxiliary step for adversarial\ndefence. By seamlessly integrating PCnets into feed-forward networks as a\npreprocessing step, we substantially bolster resilience to adversarial\nperturbations. Our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate the remarkable\neffectiveness of PCnets in mitigating adversarial examples with about 82% and\n65% improvements in robustness, respectively. The PCnet, trained on a small\nsubset of the dataset, leverages its generative nature to effectively counter\nadversarial efforts, reverting perturbed images closer to their original forms.\nThis innovative approach holds promise for enhancing the security and\nreliability of neural network classifiers in the face of the escalating threat\nof adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "Background: Breast density, as derived from mammographic images and defined\nby the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System\n(BI-RADS), is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Breast\nultrasound (BUS) is an alternative breast cancer screening modality,\nparticularly useful for early detection in low-resource, rural contexts. The\npurpose of this study was to explore an artificial intelligence (AI) model to\npredict BI-RADS mammographic breast density category from clinical, handheld\nBUS imaging. Methods: All data are sourced from the Hawaii and Pacific Islands\nMammography Registry. We compared deep learning methods from BUS imaging, as\nwell as machine learning models from image statistics alone. The use of\nAI-derived BUS density as a risk factor for breast cancer was then compared to\nclinical BI-RADS breast density while adjusting for age. The BUS data were\nsplit by individual into 70/20/10% groups for training, validation, and\ntesting. Results: 405,120 clinical BUS images from 14.066 women were selected\nfor inclusion in this study, resulting in 9.846 women for training (302,574\nimages), 2,813 for validation (11,223 images), and 1,406 for testing (4,042\nimages). On the held-out testing set, the strongest AI model achieves AUROC\n0.854 predicting BI-RADS mammographic breast density from BUS imaging and\noutperforms all shallow machine learning methods based on image statistics. In\ncancer risk prediction, age-adjusted AI BUS breast density predicted 5-year\nbreast cancer risk with 0.633 AUROC, as compared to 0.637 AUROC from\nage-adjusted clinical breast density. Conclusions: BI-RADS mammographic breast\ndensity can be estimated from BUS imaging with high accuracy using a deep\nlearning model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AI-derived BUS breast density\nis predictive of 5-year breast cancer risk in our population.",

    "abstract": "Current agricultural data management and analysis paradigms are to large\nextent traditional, in which data collecting, curating, integration, loading,\nstoring, sharing and analyzing still involve too much human effort and\nknow-how. The experts, researchers and the farm operators need to understand\nthe data and the whole process of data management pipeline to make fully use of\nthe data. The essential problem of the traditional paradigm is the lack of a\nlayer of orchestrational intelligence which can understand, organize and\ncoordinate the data processing utilities to maximize data management and\nanalysis outcome. The emerging reasoning and tool mastering abilities of large\nlanguage models (LLM) make it a potentially good fit to this position, which\nhelps a shift from the traditional user-driven paradigm to AI-driven paradigm.\nIn this paper, we propose and explore the idea of a LLM based copilot for\nautonomous agricultural data management and analysis. Based on our previously\ndeveloped platform of Agricultural Data Management and Analytics (ADMA), we\nbuild a proof-of-concept multi-agent system called ADMA Copilot, which can\nunderstand user's intent, makes plans for data processing pipeline and\naccomplishes tasks automatically, in which three agents: a LLM based\ncontroller, an input formatter and an output formatter collaborate together.\nDifferent from existing LLM based solutions, by defining a meta-program graph,\nour work decouples control flow and data flow to enhance the predictability of\nthe behaviour of the agents. Experiments demonstrates the intelligence,\nautonomy, efficacy, efficiency, extensibility, flexibility and privacy of our\nsystem. Comparison is also made between ours and existing systems to show the\nsuperiority and potential of our system.",

    "abstract": "Real-world machine learning systems often encounter model performance\ndegradation due to distributional shifts in the underlying data generating\nprocess (DGP). Existing approaches to addressing shifts, such as concept drift\nadaptation, are limited by their reason-agnostic nature. By choosing from a\npre-defined set of actions, such methods implicitly assume that the causes of\nmodel degradation are irrelevant to what actions should be taken, limiting\ntheir ability to select appropriate adaptations. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative paradigm to overcome these limitations, called self-healing machine\nlearning (SHML). Contrary to previous approaches, SHML autonomously diagnoses\nthe reason for degradation and proposes diagnosis-based corrective actions. We\nformalize SHML as an optimization problem over a space of adaptation actions to\nminimize the expected risk under the shifted DGP. We introduce a theoretical\nframework for self-healing systems and build an agentic self-healing solution\nH-LLM which uses large language models to perform self-diagnosis by reasoning\nabout the structure underlying the DGP, and self-adaptation by proposing and\nevaluating corrective actions. Empirically, we analyze different components of\nH-LLM to understand why and when it works, demonstrating the potential of\nself-healing ML.",

Current efforts in interpretability of medical\ncoding applications rely heavily on label attention mechanisms, which often\nleads to the highlighting of extraneous tokens irrelevant to the ICD code. To\nfacilitate accurate interpretability in medical language models, this paper\nleverages dictionary learning that can efficiently extract sparsely activated\nrepresentations from dense language model embeddings in superposition. Compared\nwith common label attention mechanisms, our model goes beyond token-level\nrepresentations by building an interpretable dictionary which enhances the\nmechanistic-based explanations for each ICD code prediction, even when the\nhighlighted tokens are medically irrelevant.

To\naddress these issues, this work extends SL to a new family of loss functions,\ntermed Pairwise Softmax Loss (PSL), which replaces the exponential function in\nSL with other appropriate activation functions.

As\nthe number and diversity of human experts increase, so does the likelihood that\nelements in this collective knowledge can be combined and refined to discover\nnovel and better solutions. However, it is difficult to identify, combine, and\nrefine complementary information in an increasingly large and diverse knowledge\nbase. This paper argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial\nrole in this process. An evolutionary AI framework, termed RHEA, fills this\nrole by distilling knowledge from diverse models created by human experts into\nequivalent neural networks, which are then recombined and refined in a\npopulation-based search. The framework was implemented in a formal synthetic\ndomain, demonstrating that it is transparent and systematic. It was then\napplied to the results of the XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge, in which over\n100 teams of experts across 23 countries submitted models based on diverse\nmethodologies to predict COVID-19 cases and suggest non-pharmaceutical\nintervention policies for 235 nations, states, and regions across the globe.\nBuilding upon this expert knowledge, by recombining and refining the 169\nresulting policy suggestion models, RHEA discovered a broader and more\neffective set of policies than either AI or human experts alone, as evaluated\nbased on real-world data. The results thus suggest that AI can play a crucial\nrole in realizing the potential of human expertise in global problem-solving.",

However, most of\nthese models are currently evaluated primarily on prediction accuracy,\noverlooking the validity of the rationales behind their accurate predictions.\nFor the safe deployment of foundation models, there is a pressing need to\nensure double-correct predictions, i.e., correct prediction backed by correct\nrationales. To achieve this, we propose a two-phase scheme: First, we curate a\nnew dataset that offers structured rationales for visual recognition tasks.\nSecond, we propose a rationale-informed optimization method to guide the model\nin disentangling and localizing visual evidence for each rationale, without\nrequiring manual annotations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies\ndemonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 10.1%\nin prediction accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

Since these decisions can differ from those in the\ntraining set, there is an implicit requirement that time-series models will\ngeneralize outside of their training distribution.

We extend the orthogonal statistical learning\nframework to train causal time-series models that generalize better when\nforecasting the effect of actions outside of their training distribution.

    "abstract": "As cancer cases continue to rise, with a 2023 study from Zhejiang and Harvard\npredicting a 31 percent increase in cases and a 21 percent increase in deaths\nby 2030, the need to find more effective treatments for cancer is greater than\never before. Traditional approaches to treating cancer, such as chemotherapy,\noften kill healthy cells because of their lack of targetability. In contrast,\npersonalized cancer vaccines can utilize neoepitopes - distinctive peptides on\ncancer cells that are often missed by the body's immune system - that have\nstrong binding affinities to a patient's MHC to provide a more targeted\ntreatment approach. The selection of optimal neoepitopes that elicit an immune\nresponse is a time-consuming and costly process due to the required inputs of\nmodern predictive methods. This project aims to facilitate faster, cheaper, and\nmore accurate neoepitope binding predictions using Feed Forward Neural Networks\n(FFNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).\n  To address this, NEO was created. NEO requires next-generation sequencing\ndata and uses a stacking ensemble method by calculating scores from\nstate-of-the-art models (MHCFlurry 1.6, NetMHCstabpan 1.0, and IEDB). The\nmodel's architecture includes an FFNN and an RNN with LSTM layers capable of\nanalyzing both sequential and non-sequential data. The results from both models\nare aggregated to produce predictions. Using this model, personalized cancer\nvaccines can be produced with improved results (AUC = 0.9166, recall = 91.67\npercent).",

The prevailing theoretical framework for studying machine\nlearning, namely probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, largely ignores\ntime. As a consequence, existing strategies to address the dynamic nature of\ndata and goals exhibit poor real-world performance. This paper develops a\ntheoretical framework called \"Prospective Learning\" that is tailored for\nsituations when the optimal hypothesis changes over time. In PAC learning,\nempirical risk minimization (ERM) is known to be consistent. We develop a\nlearner called Prospective ERM, which returns a sequence of predictors that\nmake predictions on future data. We prove that the risk of prospective ERM\nconverges to the Bayes risk under certain assumptions on the stochastic process\ngenerating the data. Prospective ERM, roughly speaking, incorporates time as an\ninput in addition to the data. We show that standard ERM as done in PAC\nlearning, without incorporating time, can result in failure to learn when\ndistributions are dynamic. Numerical experiments illustrate that prospective\nERM can learn synthetic and visual recognition problems constructed from MNIST\nand CIFAR-10. Code at https://github.com/neurodata/prolearn.",

Traditional experimental and computational methods face\nchallenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands,\nwhile current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision\nand generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge\n(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial\nand target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve\ngeometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge\nderived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric\nstates. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target\ngeometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition\nkernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB\nframework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more\ndetailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we\nconduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve\njoint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the\nunderlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.\nExperimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB\nsurpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for\naccurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges\nwith improved accuracy and applicability.",

It's not clear how to incorporate rich language use to\nfacilitate task learning. To address this question, this paper studies\ndifferent types of language inputs in facilitating reinforcement learning (RL)\nembodied agents.

Our empirical results based on four RL benchmarks demonstrate that\nagents trained with diverse and informative language feedback can achieve\nenhanced generalization and fast adaptation to new tasks.

A key difficulty is that\nmuch of an optimizer's behavior is implicitly determined by complex oscillatory\ndynamics, referred to as the \"edge of stability.\" The main contribution of this\npaper is to show that an optimizer's implicit behavior can be explicitly\ncaptured by a \"central flow:\" a differential equation which models the\ntime-averaged optimization trajectory. We show that these flows can empirically\npredict long-term optimization trajectories of generic neural networks with a\nhigh degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these flows, we reveal for\nthe first time 1) the precise sense in which RMSProp adapts to the local loss\nlandscape, and 2) an \"acceleration via regularization\" mechanism, wherein\nadaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards low-curvature regions in which\nthey can take larger steps. This mechanism is key to the efficacy of these\nadaptive optimizers. Overall, we believe that central flows constitute a\npromising tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.",

    "abstract": "Text embeddings enable various applications, but their performance\ndeteriorates on longer texts. In this paper, we find that the performance\ndegradation is due to a phenomenon called Length Collapse, where longer text\nembeddings collapse into a narrow space. This collapse results in a\ndistributional inconsistency between embeddings of different text lengths,\nultimately hurting the performance of downstream tasks. Theoretically, by\nconsidering the self-attention mechanism inherently functions as a low-pass\nfilter, we prove that long sequences increase the attenuation rate of the\nlow-pass filter effect of the self-attention mechanism. With layers going\ndeeper, excessive low-pass filtering causes the token signals to retain only\ntheir Direct-Current (DC) component, which means the input token feature maps\nwill collapse into a narrow space, especially in long texts. Based on the above\nanalysis, we propose to mitigate the undesirable length collapse limitation by\nintroducing a temperature in softmax(), which achieves a higher low-filter\nattenuation rate. The tuning-free method, called TempScale, can be plugged into\nmultiple transformer-based embedding models. Empirically, we demonstrate that\nTempScale can improve existing embedding models, especially on long text\ninputs, bringing up to 0.53% performance gains on 40 datasets from Massive Text\nEmbedding Benchmark (MTEB) and 0.82% performance gains on 4 datasets from\nLongEmbed, which specifically focuses on long context retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are well-known to act as over-parameterized deep\nimage priors (DIP) that regularize various image inverse problems. Meanwhile,\nresearchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors\n(e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too,\ndespite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there\nexists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized\nimage priors, can one identify \"intermediate\" parameterized image priors that\nachieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving\nstrong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis\n(LTH), we conjecture and study a novel \"lottery image prior\" (LIP) by\nexploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized\nDNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained\nin isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a\nprior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority\nof LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized\nDIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly\noutperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully\npreserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and\nthey also possess high transferability across different images as well as\nrestoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing\nimage reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior\n(in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in\nthis setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is\ndemonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.",

There has been significant interest in imitation learning for\nbimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection is\neven more challenging here due to the challenges of simultaneously controlling\nmultiple arms and multi-fingered hands.

Specifically, we\ntake the high-quality instruction-response pairs in existing datasets and only\nadopt advanced LLMs to add complex constraints already met by the responses to\nthe instructions, which naturally reduces costs and data noise. In the\nexperiments, we adopt Llama3-70B-Instruct to back-translate constraints and\ncreate a high-quality complex instruction-response dataset, named CRAB.

While many of these models have been developed for tasks like\ndisease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse\ntraining datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest\ntasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney),\nremains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, \"How good are\nwe?\", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models\non a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing\ndataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, \"How can we\nimprove?\", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment\nstrategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance\non pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a\nmulticenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney\nwhole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation\nmodels-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle\nthe second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling\npredictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop\nframework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal\nhuman efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models\nimproved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data.\nInterestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the\nbest segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning.

Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning\napproach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly\nfine-tuned on the target domain.",

This involves constructing a new graph kernel for\ngraphs with both continuous and categorical attributes, as well as new\noptimisation methods for learning heuristic functions for numeric planning.\nExperiments show that our graph kernels are vastly more efficient and\ngeneralise better than graph neural networks for numeric planning, and also\nyield competitive coverage performance compared to domain-independent numeric\nplanners.

    "abstract": "Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems have become a popular\ntool in both neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Having measures to\ncompare how similar activations of neurons are across conditions,\narchitectures, and species, gives us a scalable way of learning how information\nis transformed within different neural networks. In contrast to this trend,\nrecent investigations have revealed how some metrics can respond to spurious\nsignals and hence give misleading results. To identify the most reliable metric\nand understand how measures could be improved, it is going to be important to\nidentify specific test cases which can serve as benchmarks. Here we propose\nthat the phenomena of compositional learning in recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) allows us to build a test case for dynamical representation alignment\nmetrics. By implementing this case, we show it enables us to test whether\nmetrics can identify representations which gradually develop throughout\nlearning and probe whether representations identified by metrics are relevant\nto computations executed by networks. By building both an attractor- and\nRNN-based test case, we show that the new Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA)\nis more noise robust and identifies behaviorally relevant representations more\nreliably than prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also show how test cases can\nbe used beyond evaluating metrics to study new architectures. Specifically,\nresults from applying DSA to modern (Mamba) state space models, suggest that,\nin contrast to RNNs, these models may not exhibit changes to their recurrent\ndynamics due to their expressiveness. Overall, by developing test cases, we\nshow DSA's exceptional ability to detect compositional dynamical motifs,\nthereby enhancing our understanding of how computations unfold in RNNs.",

Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover\nthe latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them,\nup to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments,\neach of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node\n(factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community\nhas been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node\ninterventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent\nfactors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a\nsetting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also\nallow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely \\textit{change the\nentire causal graph over the latent factors}. On the flip side, we relax what\nwe wish to extract to simply the \\textit{list of nodes that have shifted\nbetween one or more environments}. We provide a surprising identifiability\nresult that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions,\nto identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a\nconstructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for\na node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given\nobserved data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting\nwhere instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of\nsamples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both\nsynthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset. The code\ncan be found at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS.",

These spoofing attacks often\ninvolve unique 3D structures, such as printed papers or mobile device screens.\nAlthough stereo-depth cameras can detect such attacks effectively, their\nhigh-cost limits their widespread adoption. Conversely, two-sensor systems\nwithout extrinsic calibration offer a cost-effective alternative but are unable\nto calculate depth using stereo techniques.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the identifiability of average controlled\ndirect effects and average natural direct effects in causal systems represented\nby summary causal graphs, which are abstractions of full causal graphs, often\nused in dynamic systems where cycles and omitted temporal information\ncomplicate causal inference. Unlike in the traditional linear setting, where\ndirect effects are typically easier to identify and estimate, non-parametric\ndirect effects, which are crucial for handling real-world complexities,\nparticularly in epidemiological contexts where relationships between variables\n(e.g, genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors) are often non-linear, are\nmuch harder to define and identify. In particular, we give sufficient\nconditions for identifying average controlled micro direct effect and average\nnatural micro direct effect from summary causal graphs in the presence of\nhidden confounding. Furthermore, we show that the conditions given for the\naverage controlled micro direct effect become also necessary in the setting\nwhere there is no hidden confounding and where we are only interested in\nidentifiability by adjustment.",

    "abstract": "Surgical scene segmentation is essential for enhancing surgical precision,\nyet it is frequently compromised by the scarcity and imbalance of available\ndata. To address these challenges, semantic image synthesis methods based on\ngenerative adversarial networks and diffusion models have been developed.\nHowever, these models often yield non-diverse images and fail to capture small,\ncritical tissue classes, limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose\nthe Class-Aware Semantic Diffusion Model (CASDM), a novel approach which\nutilizes segmentation maps as conditions for image synthesis to tackle data\nscarcity and imbalance. Novel class-aware mean squared error and class-aware\nself-perceptual loss functions have been defined to prioritize critical, less\nvisible classes, thereby enhancing image quality and relevance. Furthermore, to\nour knowledge, we are the first to generate multi-class segmentation maps using\ntext prompts in a novel fashion to specify their contents. These maps are then\nused by CASDM to generate surgical scene images, enhancing datasets for\ntraining and validating segmentation models. Our evaluation, which assesses\nboth image quality and downstream segmentation performance, demonstrates the\nstrong effectiveness and generalisability of CASDM in producing realistic\nimage-map pairs, significantly advancing surgical scene segmentation across\ndiverse and challenging datasets.",

In this study, we propose the\nrepresentative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic\nrepresentation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and\nindividuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly.\nThese scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as\njury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance,\nand, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice,\nthe population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs\nbased on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the\ndeepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated\nas statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of\nsocial choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further\nformulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like\nimpossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis.

Traditional compression methods, such as\nquantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate\ncompression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable\nmemory environments. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{BitStack}, a novel,\ntraining-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level\ntrade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight\ndecomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal\ntransmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach\niteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of\neach parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual\nblock in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in\nstorage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on\ncurrent memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks\ndemonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack\nconsistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly\nat extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndecomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical\ncompression techniques like quantization.

There are many potential causes of hallucination, of\nwhich, one hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on data produced by a larger\nmodel leads to a knowledge mismatch which contributes to hallucination. In\nparticular, it is hypothesized that there is a mismatch between the knowledge\nthat is fed to the model to fine-tune it and the knowledge that is already\npresent in the graph. Fine-tuning the model on data that has such mismatch\ncould contribute to an increased propensity to hallucinate.

The reasons behind this phenomenon and\npotential solutions have not yet been provided. In order to investigate the\nreasons for the performance decline of the edited model and optimize the\nediting method, this work explores the underlying reasons from both data and\nmodel perspectives. Specifically, 1) from a data perspective, to clarify the\nimpact of data on the performance of editing models, this paper first\nconstructs a Multi-Question Dataset (MQD) to evaluate the impact of different\ntypes of editing data on model performance. The performance of the editing\nmodel is mainly affected by the diversity of editing targets and sequence\nlength, as determined through experiments. 2) From a model perspective, this\narticle explores the factors that affect the performance of editing models. The\nresults indicate a strong correlation between the L1-norm of the editing model\nlayer and the editing accuracy, and clarify that this is an important factor\nleading to the bottleneck of editing performance. Finally, in order to improve\nthe performance of the editing model, this paper further proposes a Dump for\nSequence (D4S) method, which successfully overcomes the previous editing\nbottleneck by reducing the L1-norm of the editing layer, allowing users to\nperform multiple effective edits and minimizing model damage.

    "abstract": "Snoring, an acoustic biomarker commonly observed in individuals with\nObstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS), holds significant potential for\ndiagnosing and monitoring this recognized clinical disorder. Irrespective of\nsnoring types, most snoring instances exhibit identifiable harmonic patterns\nmanifested through distinctive energy distributions over time. In this work, we\npropose a novel method to differentiate monaural snoring from non-snoring\nsounds by analyzing the harmonic content of the input sound using\nharmonic/percussive sound source separation (HPSS). The resulting feature,\nbased on the harmonic spectrogram from HPSS, is employed as input data for\nconventional neural network architectures, aiming to enhance snoring detection\nperformance even under a limited data learning framework. To evaluate the\nperformance of our proposal, we studied two different scenarios: 1) using a\nlarge dataset of snoring and interfering sounds, and 2) using a reduced\ntraining set composed of around 1% of the data material. In the former\nscenario, the proposed HPSS-based feature provides competitive results compared\nto other input features from the literature. However, the key advantage of the\nproposed method lies in the superior performance of the harmonic spectrogram\nderived from HPSS in a limited data learning context. In this particular\nscenario, using the proposed harmonic feature significantly enhances the\nperformance of all the studied architectures in comparison to the classical\ninput features documented in the existing literature. This finding clearly\ndemonstrates that incorporating harmonic content enables more reliable learning\nof the essential time-frequency characteristics that are prevalent in most\nsnoring sounds, even in scenarios where the amount of training data is limited.",

While the AlphaZero\nalgorithm has demonstrated an impressive ability to learn the rules and\nstrategy of a large variety of games, ranging from Go and Chess, to Atari\ngames, its reliance on extensive computational resources and rigid\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture limits its adaptability and\nscalability. A model trained to play on a $19\\times 19$ Go board cannot be used\nto play on a smaller $13\\times 13$ board, despite the similarity between the\ntwo Go variants. In this paper, we focus on Chess, and explore using a more\ngeneric Graph-based Representation of a game state, rather than a grid-based\none, to introduce a more general architecture based on Graph Neural Networks\n(GNN). We also expand the classical Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer to\nincorporate edge-features, to naturally provide a generic policy output format.\nOur experiments, performed on smaller networks than the initial AlphaZero\npaper, show that this new architecture outperforms previous architectures with\na similar number of parameters, being able to increase playing strength an\norder of magnitude faster. We also show that the model, when trained on a\nsmaller $5\\times 5$ variant of chess, is able to be quickly fine-tuned to play\non regular $8\\times 8$ chess, suggesting that this approach yields promising\ngeneralization abilities.

While graph kernel methods such as the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment\n(WLOA) kernels are effective in capturing similarity relationships, they rely\nheavily on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearity for more\ncomplex data patterns.

Given the analogy\nbetween the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly\ncompare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that\nthe similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically\nconsistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent\niterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel.\nInspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the\nsimilarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing\nrelational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we\npropose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be\nconsistent across different layers.

We investigate the\ntraining patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs), through\nthe lens of gradient, when training with different responses and initial\nmodels. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects\nthe layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on\nreasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our\nstudy, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger\ndifferences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT),\nindicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Moreover, pre-trained\nLLMs are less affected by the instability of fast thinking than\ninstruction-tuned LLMs. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns\ncan reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using\nslow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow\nthinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths.

Our review of the literature identified two broad themes\nrepresenting the purpose of the interaction between these two areas:\nargumentation for machine learning and machine learning for argumentation.\nAcross these two themes, we systematically evaluate the spectrum of works\nacross various dimensions, including the type of learning and the form of\nargumentation framework used. Further, we identify three types of interaction\nbetween these two areas: synergistic approaches, where the Argumentation and\nMachine Learning components are tightly integrated; segmented approaches, where\nthe two are interleaved such that the outputs of one are the inputs of the\nother; and approximated approaches, where one component shadows the other at a\nchosen level of detail. We draw conclusions about the suitability of certain\nforms of Argumentation for supporting certain types of Machine Learning, and\nvice versa, with clear patterns emerging from the review. Whilst the reviewed\nworks provide inspiration for successfully combining the two fields of\nresearch, we also identify and discuss limitations and challenges that ought to\nbe addressed in order to ensure that they remain a fruitful pairing as AI\nadvances.",

Prior works have explored prompt\nevolving, but are often limited to the supervised fine-tuning stage, and\nprompts are sampled and evolved uniformly without signals. This empirical work\npresents a paradigm shift: Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva),\nthat casts post-training as an infinite game with regret-based signals for 2\nplayers: (i) a creator, who strategically samples and creates new informative\nprompts and (ii) a solver, who learns to produce preferred responses. eva is\nthe first method that allows language models to adaptively create training\nprompts in both offline and online RL post-training. The design is simple,\neasy-to-use yet remarkably effective: eva sets a new SOTA on challenging\nbenchmarks, without any extra human prompts, e.g. it boosts the win-rate of\ngemma-2-9b-it on Arena-Hard by 51.6% -> 60.1% for DPO and 52.6% -> 62.4% for\nRLOO, surpassing claude-3-opus and catching up to gemini-1.5-pro, both of which\nare orders of magnitude larger.

Map entity representation learning (MapRL) generates\nversatile and reusable data representations, providing essential tools for\nefficiently managing and utilizing map entity data. Despite the progress in\nMapRL, two key challenges constrain further development. First, existing\nresearch is fragmented, with models classified by the type of map entity,\nlimiting the reusability of techniques across different tasks. Second, the lack\nof unified benchmarks makes systematic evaluation and comparison of models\ndifficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel taxonomy for MapRL\nthat organizes models based on functional module-such as encoders, pre-training\ntasks, and downstream tasks-rather than by entity type. Building on this\ntaxonomy, we present a taxonomy-driven library, VecCity, which offers\neasy-to-use interfaces for encoding, pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.\nThe library integrates datasets from nine cities and reproduces 21 mainstream\nMapRL models, establishing the first standardized benchmarks for the field.\nVecCity also allows users to modify and extend models through modular\ncomponents, facilitating seamless experimentation. Our comprehensive\nexperiments cover multiple types of map entities and evaluate 21 VecCity\npre-built models across various downstream tasks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of VecCity in streamlining model development and\nprovide insights into the impact of various components on performance.

GPUs significantly underperform during token generation due to\nsynchronization overheads at kernel boundaries, utilizing only 21% of their\npeak memory bandwidth. While recent dataflow architectures mitigate these\noverheads by enabling aggressive fusion of decoder layers into a single kernel,\nthey too leave performance on the table due to synchronization penalties at\nlayer boundaries.\n  This paper presents kernel looping, a specialized global optimization\ntechnique which exploits an optimization opportunity brought by combining the\nunique layer-level fusion possible in modern dataflow architectures with the\nrepeated layer structure found in language models. Kernel looping eliminates\nsynchronization costs between consecutive calls to the same kernel by\ntransforming these calls into a single call to a modified kernel containing a\npipelined outer loop. We evaluate kernel looping on the SambaNova SN40L\nReconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU), a commercial dataflow accelerator for AI.\nExperiments demonstrate that kernel looping speeds up the decode phase of a\nwide array of powerful open-source models by up to 2.2$\\times$ on SN40L. Kernel\nlooping allows scaling of decode performance over multiple SN40L sockets,\nachieving speedups of up to 2.5$\\times$. Finally, kernel looping enables SN40L\nto achieve over 90% of peak performance on 8 and 16 sockets and achieve a\nspeedup of up to 3.7$\\times$ over DGX H100.

To bridge\nthis gap, we investigate various PEFT methods under noisy labels.\nInterestingly, our findings reveal that PEFT has difficulty in memorizing noisy\nlabels due to its inherently limited capacity, resulting in robustness.\nHowever, we also find that such limited capacity simultaneously makes PEFT more\nvulnerable to interference of noisy labels, impeding the learning of clean\nsamples.

The advancements in\nLLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and\ninstruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we\npropose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is\nan end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the\ndiscrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the\nmulti-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph\ntokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif\nrepresentations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce\nmachine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the\nlarge molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language\nunderstanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best\nperformance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation,\nproperty prediction, and IUPAC name prediction.

Many\nstudies demonstrated that 3HGs can be reliable nodes when constructing brain\nnetworks or connectome since they simultaneously possess commonality and\nindividuality across different individual brains and populations. However, 3HGs\nare identified and validated within individual spaces, making it difficult to\ndirectly serve as the brain network nodes due to the absence of cross-subject\ncorrespondence. The 3HG correspondences represent the intrinsic regulation of\nbrain organizational architecture, traditional image-based registration methods\ntend to fail because individual anatomical properties need to be fully\nrespected. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised\nframework for anatomical feature embedding of the 3HGs to build the\ncorrespondences among different brains.

    "abstract": "Real-world data is often assumed to lie within a low-dimensional structure\nembedded in high-dimensional space. In practical settings, we observe only a\nfinite set of samples, forming what we refer to as the sample data subspace. It\nserves an essential approximation supporting tasks such as dimensionality\nreduction and generation. A major challenge lies in whether generative models\ncan reliably synthesize samples that stay within this subspace rather than\ndrifting away from the underlying structure. In this work, we provide\ntheoretical insights into this challenge by leveraging Flow Matching models,\nwhich transform a simple prior into a complex target distribution via a learned\nvelocity field. By treating the real data distribution as discrete, we derive\nanalytical expressions for the optimal velocity field under a Gaussian prior,\nshowing that generated samples memorize real data points and represent the\nsample data subspace exactly. To generalize to suboptimal scenarios, we\nintroduce the Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition Network (OSDNet), which\nsystematically decomposes the velocity field into subspace and off-subspace\ncomponents. Our analysis shows that the off-subspace component decays, while\nthe subspace component generalizes within the sample data subspace, ensuring\ngenerated samples preserve both proximity and diversity.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the\ncontemporary landscape of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

However, due to the unpredictability\nof LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed\nby current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues\nand long job response times.\n  In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework,\nnamed ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel\nspeculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and\nexploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus\nminimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore,\nto mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we\nemploy a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and\nquantization-based compression techniques.

The\nsecond strategy, Learning from Fact-Checks via Self-Training, involves\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fact-checked responses or applying Simple\nPreference Optimization (SimPO) with fact-checking as a ranking mechanism, both\nupdating LLM parameters from supervision. These findings suggest that\nintegrating fact-checked responses whether through RAG enhancement or\nself-training enhances the reliability and factual correctness of LLM outputs,\noffering a promising solution for applications where information accuracy is\ncrucial.",

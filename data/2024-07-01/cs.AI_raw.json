    "abstract": "Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced\ninstruction-following capabilities. However, most Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT)\ndatasets are predominantly in English, limiting model performance in other\nlanguages. Traditional methods for creating multilingual IFT datasets such as\ntranslating existing English IFT datasets or converting existing NLP datasets\ninto IFT datasets by templating, struggle to capture linguistic nuances and\nensure prompt (instruction) diversity. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel method for collecting multilingual IFT datasets that preserves linguistic\nnaturalness and ensures prompt diversity. This approach leverages\nEnglish-focused LLMs, monolingual corpora, and a scoring function to create\nhigh-quality, diversified IFT datasets in multiple languages. Experiments\ndemonstrate that LLMs finetuned using these IFT datasets show notable\nimprovements in both generative and discriminative tasks, indicating enhanced\nlanguage comprehension by LLMs in non-English contexts. Specifically, on the\nmultilingual summarization task, LLMs using our IFT dataset achieved 17.57% and\n15.23% improvements over LLMs fine-tuned with translation-based and\ntemplate-based datasets, respectively.",

From the preliminary findings, it can be deduced that both the Monte\nCarlo method and Quasi-Monte Carlo method produce similar results in terms of\noptimal fitness values.

One important application\nof LLM is LLM-based AI Agent, which leverages the ability of LLM as well as\nexternal tools for complex-task solving.

However, normalization brings with it a subtle\nbut important side effect: an equivalence between growth in the norm of the\nnetwork parameters and decay in the effective learning rate. This becomes\nproblematic in continual learning settings, where the resulting effective\nlearning rate schedule may decay to near zero too quickly relative to the\ntimescale of the learning problem. We propose to make the learning rate\nschedule explicit with a simple re-parameterization which we call\nNormalize-and-Project (NaP), which couples the insertion of normalization\nlayers with weight projection, ensuring that the effective learning rate\nremains constant throughout training. This technique reveals itself as a\npowerful analytical tool to better understand learning rate schedules in deep\nreinforcement learning, and as a means of improving robustness to\nnonstationarity in synthetic plasticity loss benchmarks along with both the\nsingle-task and sequential variants of the Arcade Learning Environment. We also\nshow that our approach can be easily applied to popular architectures such as\nResNets and transformers while recovering and in some cases even slightly\nimproving the performance of the base model in common stationary benchmarks.",

We\nexperimentally show that images synthesized via neural semantic image synthesis\nachieve similar or superior pixel-level alignment of semantic classes compared\nto those created using expensive semantic label maps. At the same time, they\ncapture better semantics, instance separation, and object orientation than\nother label-free conditioning options, such as edges or depth.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for\nperforming specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM\ndeployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges,\nnotably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated\ninformation. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety,\nwhere inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have\ndeveloped and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically\ndesigned to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug\nsafety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts.\nThese guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent\nthe ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse\nevent terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these\nguardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves\nconverting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports\ninto natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case\nsafety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance\nprocessing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad\napplicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in\nhigh-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the\ngeneration of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to\nstringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical\nenvironments.",

We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs --\nGPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting.

We show that these factors can\ndrastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested\nwith GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from\n26% to 70%.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse\nproblems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the\ndiffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications\nto samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct\nerrors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated\nnonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS)\nthat relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple\nconsecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary\nconsiderably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the\ntrue posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration\nof a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate\nreconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality\nand stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in\ncomplicated nonlinear inverse problems.",

    "abstract": "In multi-objective optimization, set-based quality indicators are a\ncornerstone of benchmarking and performance assessment. They capture the\nquality of a set of trade-off solutions by reducing it to a scalar number. One\nof the most commonly used set-based metrics is the R2 indicator, which\ndescribes the expected utility of a solution set to a decision-maker under a\ndistribution of utility functions. Typically, this indicator is applied by\ndiscretizing this distribution of utility functions, yielding a weakly\nPareto-compliant indicator. In consequence, adding a nondominated or dominating\nsolution to a solution set may - but does not have to - improve the indicator's\nvalue.\n  In this paper, we reinvestigate the R2 indicator under the premise that we\nhave a continuous, uniform distribution of (Tchebycheff) utility functions. We\nanalyze its properties in detail, demonstrating that this continuous variant is\nindeed Pareto-compliant - that is, any beneficial solution will improve the\nmetric's value. Additionally, we provide an efficient computational procedure\nto compute this metric for bi-objective problems in $\\mathcal O (N \\log N)$. As\na result, this work contributes to the state-of-the-art Pareto-compliant unary\nperformance metrics, such as the hypervolume indicator, offering an efficient\nand promising alternative.",

    "abstract": "AI agents are an exciting new research direction, and agent development is\ndriven by benchmarks. Our analysis of current agent benchmarks and evaluation\npractices reveals several shortcomings that hinder their usefulness in\nreal-world applications. First, there is a narrow focus on accuracy without\nattention to other metrics. As a result, SOTA agents are needlessly complex and\ncostly, and the community has reached mistaken conclusions about the sources of\naccuracy gains. Our focus on cost in addition to accuracy motivates the new\ngoal of jointly optimizing the two metrics. We design and implement one such\noptimization, showing its potential to greatly reduce cost while maintaining\naccuracy. Second, the benchmarking needs of model and downstream developers\nhave been conflated, making it hard to identify which agent would be best\nsuited for a particular application. Third, many agent benchmarks have\ninadequate holdout sets, and sometimes none at all. This has led to agents that\nare fragile because they take shortcuts and overfit to the benchmark in various\nways. We prescribe a principled framework for avoiding overfitting. Finally,\nthere is a lack of standardization in evaluation practices, leading to a\npervasive lack of reproducibility. We hope that the steps we introduce for\naddressing these shortcomings will spur the development of agents that are\nuseful in the real world and not just accurate on benchmarks.",

We\npropose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by\nformulating it as a regression task. RegMix trains many small models on diverse\ndata mixtures, uses regression to predict performance of unseen mixtures, and\napplies the best predicted mixture to train a large-scale model with orders of\nmagnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models\nwith 1M parameters for 1B tokens to fit the regression model and predict the\nbest data mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B\ntokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we find performs best among 64\ncandidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Furthermore, RegMix\nconsistently outperforms human selection in experiments involving models up to\n7B models trained on 100B tokens, while matching or exceeding DoReMi using just\n10% of the computational resources. Our experiments also show that (1) Data\nmixtures significantly impact performance; (2) Web corpora rather than data\nperceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive\ncorrelation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways\noften contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are\nneeded; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws.

We provide one of the most\ncomprehensive studies to-date of how the source of synthetic data shapes\nmodels' internal biases, calibration and generations' textual attributes and\npreferences. We find that models are surprisingly sensitive towards certain\nattributes even when the synthetic data prompts appear \"neutral\". which invites\nthe question whether this sensitivity can be exploited for good.\n  Our findings invite the question can we explicitly steer the models towards\nthe properties we want at test time by exploiting the data generation process?\nThis would have historically been considered infeasible due to the cost of\ncollecting data with a specific characteristic or objective in mind. However,\nimprovement in the quality of synthetic data, as well as a shift towards\ngeneral-purpose models designed to follow a diverse way of instructions, means\nthis question is timely. We propose active inheritance as a term to describe\nintentionally constraining synthetic data according to a non-differentiable\nobjective.

More recently, researchers and\nindustry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform\nend-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the\nability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and\nplan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based\napproaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the\nfollowing question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software\nagents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless -- an agentless\napproach to automatically solve software development problems. Compared to the\nverbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a\nsimplistic three-phase process of localization, repair, and patch validation,\nwithout letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools.\nOur results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the\nsimplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (32.00%,\n96 correct fixes) and low cost ($0.70) compared with all existing open-source\nsoftware agents! Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench\nLite and found problems with exact ground truth patch or\ninsufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench\nLite-S by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation\nand comparison. Our work highlights the current overlooked potential of a\nsimple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development.

    "abstract": "Current large language models (LLMs) often perform poorly on simple fact\nretrieval tasks. Here we investigate if coupling a dynamically adaptable\nexternal memory to a LLM can alleviate this problem. For this purpose, we test\nLarimar, a recently proposed language model architecture which uses an external\nassociative memory, on long-context recall tasks including passkey and\nneedle-in-the-haystack tests. We demonstrate that the external memory of\nLarimar, which allows fast write and read of an episode of text samples, can be\nused at test time to handle contexts much longer than those seen during\ntraining. We further show that the latent readouts from the memory (to which\nlong contexts are written) control the decoder towards generating correct\noutputs, with the memory stored off of the GPU. Compared to existing\ntransformer-based LLM architectures for long-context recall tasks that use\nlarger parameter counts or modified attention mechanisms, a relatively smaller\nsize Larimar is able to maintain strong performance without any task-specific\ntraining or training on longer contexts.",

In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high\nobject variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously\nhand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the\nchallenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must\nevolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that\ncombines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction\n(LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage\nvisual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of\ninteraction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated\ndata through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using\npseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method\non two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an\n$\\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\\%$ improvement over existing work,\nand obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation,\nachieving an $\\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \\%$ of annotated\ndata compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.",

Traditional methods, relying on manual inspection\nand rule-based systems, are often too slow and labor-intensive to meet the\ndemands of modern networks. In this paper, we present PCAPVision, a novel\napproach that utilizes computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nto detect failures in PCAP files. By converting PCAP data into images, our\nmethod leverages the robust pattern recognition capabilities of CNNs to analyze\nnetwork traffic efficiently.

Additionally, we incorporate a continual learning framework,\nleveraging automated annotation for the feedback loop, to adapt the model\ndynamically and ensure sustained performance over time. Our approach\nsignificantly reduces the time required for failure detection. The initial\ntraining phase uses a Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) dataset, demonstrating the model's\neffectiveness and generalizability when using transfer learning on Mobility\nManagement services.

Despite the impressive performance of various hyperbolic neural\nnetworks across numerous domains, research on adapting the Transformer to\nhyperbolic space remains limited. Previous attempts have mainly focused on\nmodifying self-attention modules in the Transformer. However, these efforts\nhave fallen short of developing a complete hyperbolic Transformer. This stems\nprimarily from: (i) the absence of well-defined modules in hyperbolic space,\nincluding linear transformation layers, LayerNorm layers, activation functions,\ndropout operations, etc. (ii) the quadratic time complexity of the existing\nhyperbolic self-attention module w.r.t the number of input tokens, which\nhinders its scalability. To address these challenges, we propose, Hypformer, a\nnovel hyperbolic Transformer based on the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry.\nIn Hypformer, we introduce two foundational blocks that define the essential\nmodules of the Transformer in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we develop a\nlinear self-attention mechanism in hyperbolic space, enabling hyperbolic\nTransformer to process billion-scale graph data and long-sequence inputs for\nthe first time. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness and\nefficiency of Hypformer across various datasets, demonstrating its potential as\nan effective and scalable solution for large-scale data representation and\nlarge models.",

Existing benchmarks, such as MathVista and MathVerse, focus more on\nthe result-oriented performance but neglect the underlying principles in\nknowledge acquisition and generalization. Inspired by human-like mathematical\nreasoning, we introduce WE-MATH, the first benchmark specifically designed to\nexplore the problem-solving principles beyond end-to-end performance. We\nmeticulously collect and categorize 6.5K visual math problems, spanning 67\nhierarchical knowledge concepts and five layers of knowledge granularity. We\ndecompose composite problems into sub-problems according to the required\nknowledge concepts and introduce a novel four-dimensional metric, namely\nInsufficient Knowledge (IK), Inadequate Generalization (IG), Complete Mastery\n(CM), and Rote Memorization (RM), to hierarchically assess inherent issues in\nLMMs' reasoning process. With WE-MATH, we conduct a thorough evaluation of\nexisting LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and reveal a negative\ncorrelation between solving steps and problem-specific performance. We confirm\nthe IK issue of LMMs can be effectively improved via knowledge augmentation\nstrategies. More notably, the primary challenge of GPT-4o has significantly\ntransitioned from IK to IG, establishing it as the first LMM advancing towards\nthe knowledge generalization stage. In contrast, other LMMs exhibit a marked\ninclination towards Rote Memorization - they correctly solve composite problems\ninvolving multiple knowledge concepts yet fail to answer sub-problems. We\nanticipate that WE-MATH will open new pathways for advancements in visual\nmathematical reasoning for LMMs. The WE-MATH data and evaluation code are\navailable at https://github.com/We-Math/We-Math.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs), which integrate\nboth electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy\n(fNIRS) signals, outperform those based solely on EEG. However, simultaneously\nrecording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of\ncolocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical\nconstraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby\nlimiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To facilitate the\nacquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals, this study proposes the\nspatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for\ncross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules,\nthe spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal\nrepresentation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent\ntemporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified\nrepresentation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS\nrepresentations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results\nshow high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint\nclassification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to\nor even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the\nsynthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals\nwhile preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. Experimental results\nsuggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of\nhybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems.",

Implicit biases are significant because\nthey influence the decisions made by these systems, potentially perpetuating\nstereotypes and discrimination, even when LLMs appear to function fairly.\nTraditionally, explicit bias tests or embedding-based methods are employed to\ndetect bias, but these approaches can overlook more nuanced, implicit forms of\nbias. To address this, we introduce two novel psychological-inspired\nmethodologies: the LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias and the LLM\nDecision Bias, designed to reveal and measure implicit biases through\nprompt-based and decision-making tasks. Additionally, open-ended generation\ntasks with thematic analysis of word generations and storytelling provide\nqualitative insights into the model's behavior. Our findings demonstrate that\nthe LLM IAT Bias correlates with traditional methods and more effectively\npredicts downstream behaviors, as measured by the LLM Decision Bias, offering a\nmore comprehensive framework for detecting subtle biases in AI systems.

    "abstract": "As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context\nlength in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the\nintermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the\nprimary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods\nselectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation\nin LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining\nmodel quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from\nadvanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management\ncommunity, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical\nembedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product\nQuantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring\nlow serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys\nfor each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use\nPQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens,\nthen fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation.\nThrough meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any\nadditional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and\nefficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench\nand low system latency in both prefilling and decoding.",

    "abstract": "Model extraction attacks currently pose a non-negligible threat to the\nsecurity and privacy of deep learning models. By querying the model with a\nsmall dataset and usingthe query results as the ground-truth labels, an\nadversary can steal a piracy model with performance comparable to the original\nmodel. Two key issues that cause the threat are, on the one hand, accurate and\nunlimited queries can be obtained by the adversary; on the other hand, the\nadversary can aggregate the query results to train the model step by step. The\nexisting defenses usually employ model watermarking or fingerprinting to\nprotect the ownership. However, these methods cannot proactively prevent the\nviolation from happening. To mitigate the threat, we propose QUEEN (QUEry\nunlEarNing) that proactively launches counterattacks on potential model\nextraction attacks from the very beginning. To limit the potential threat,\nQUEEN has sensitivity measurement and outputs perturbation that prevents the\nadversary from training a piracy model with high performance. In sensitivity\nmeasurement, QUEEN measures the single query sensitivity by its distance from\nthe center of its cluster in the feature space. To reduce the learning accuracy\nof attacks, for the highly sensitive query batch, QUEEN applies query\nunlearning, which is implemented by gradient reverse to perturb the softmax\noutput such that the piracy model will generate reverse gradients to worsen its\nperformance unconsciously. Experiments show that QUEEN outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art defenses against various model extraction attacks with a\nrelatively low cost to the model accuracy.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to determine whether students will respond\ncorrectly to the next question, which is a crucial task in intelligent tutoring\nsystems (ITS). In educational KT scenarios, transductive ID-based methods often\nface severe data sparsity and cold start problems, where interactions between\nindividual students and questions are sparse, and new questions and concepts\nconsistently arrive in the database. In addition, existing KT models only\nimplicitly consider the correlation between concepts and questions, lacking\ndirect modeling of the more complex relationships in the heterogeneous graph of\nconcepts and questions. In this paper, we propose a Structure-aware Inductive\nKnowledge Tracing model with large language model (dubbed SINKT), which, for\nthe first time, introduces large language models (LLMs) and realizes inductive\nknowledge tracing. Firstly, SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural\nrelationships between concepts and constructs a heterogeneous graph for\nconcepts and questions. Secondly, by encoding concepts and questions with LLMs,\nSINKT incorporates semantic information to aid prediction. Finally, SINKT\npredicts the student's response to the target question by interacting with the\nstudent's knowledge state and the question representation. Experiments on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that SINKT achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among 12 existing transductive KT models. Additionally, we explore\nthe performance of SINKT on the inductive KT task and provide insights into\nvarious modules.",

    "abstract": "The single-stage point-based 3D object detectors have attracted widespread\nresearch interest due to their advantages of lightweight and fast inference\nspeed. However, they still face challenges such as inadequate learning of\nlow-quality objects (ILQ) and misalignment between localization accuracy and\nclassification confidence (MLC). In this paper, we propose SGCCNet to alleviate\nthese two issues. For ILQ, SGCCNet adopts a Saliency-Guided Data Augmentation\n(SGDA) strategy to enhance the robustness of the model on low-quality objects\nby reducing its reliance on salient features. Specifically, We construct a\nclassification task and then approximate the saliency scores of points by\nmoving points towards the point cloud centroid in a differentiable process.\nDuring the training process, SGCCNet will be forced to learn from low saliency\nfeatures through dropping points. Meanwhile, to avoid internal covariate shift\nand contextual features forgetting caused by dropping points, we add a\ngeometric normalization module and skip connection block in each stage. For\nMLC, we design a Confidence Correction Mechanism (CCM) specifically for\npoint-based multi-class detectors. This mechanism corrects the confidence of\nthe current proposal by utilizing the predictions of other key points within\nthe local region in the post-processing stage. Extensive experiments on the\nKITTI dataset demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our SGCCNet. On\nthe KITTI \\textit{test} set, SGCCNet achieves $80.82\\%$ for the metric of\n$AP_{3D}$ on the \\textit{Moderate} level, outperforming all other point-based\ndetectors, surpassing IA-SSD and Fast Point R-CNN by $2.35\\%$ and $3.42\\%$,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "While extensive research exists on physical adversarial attacks within the\nvisible spectrum, studies on such techniques in the infrared spectrum are\nlimited. Infrared object detectors are vital in modern technological\napplications but are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant\nsecurity threats. Previous studies using physical perturbations like light bulb\narrays and aerogels for white-box attacks, or hot and cold patches for\nblack-box attacks, have proven impractical or limited in multi-view support. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Adversarial Infrared Grid (AdvGrid), which\nmodels perturbations in a grid format and uses a genetic algorithm for\nblack-box optimization. These perturbations are cyclically applied to various\nparts of a pedestrian's clothing to facilitate multi-view black-box physical\nattacks on infrared pedestrian detectors. Extensive experiments validate\nAdvGrid's effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. The method achieves\nattack success rates of 80.00\\% in digital environments and 91.86\\% in physical\nenvironments, outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, the average attack\nsuccess rate exceeds 50\\% against mainstream detectors, demonstrating AdvGrid's\nrobustness. Our analyses include ablation studies, transfer attacks, and\nadversarial defenses, confirming the method's superiority.",

However, the shared embedding space could\nlead to new vulnerabilities if different modalities can be misaligned.

Using the procedure, we show that we can align the\nembeddings of distinguishable texts to any image through unnoticeable\nadversarial attacks in joint image-text models, revealing that semantically\nunrelated images can have embeddings of identical texts and at the same time\nvisually indistinguishable images can be matched to the embeddings of very\ndifferent texts. Our technique achieves 100\\% success rate when it is applied\nto text datasets and images from multiple sources.

    "abstract": "Understanding the decisions of deep learning (DL) models is essential for the\nacceptance of DL to risk-sensitive applications. Although methods, like class\nactivation maps (CAMs), give a glimpse into the black box, they do miss some\ncrucial information, thereby limiting its interpretability and merely providing\nthe considered locations of objects. To provide more insight into the models\nand the influence of datasets, we propose an integrated feature analysis\nmethod, which consists of feature distribution analysis and feature\ndecomposition, to look closer into the intermediate features extracted by DL\nmodels. This integrated feature analysis could provide information on\noverfitting, confounders, outliers in datasets, model redundancies and\nprincipal features extracted by the models, and provide distribution\ninformation to form a common intensity scale, which are missing in current CAM\nalgorithms. The integrated feature analysis was applied to eight different\ndatasets for general validation: photographs of handwritten digits, two\ndatasets of natural images and five medical datasets, including skin\nphotography, ultrasound, CT, X-rays and MRIs. The method was evaluated by\ncalculating the consistency between the CAMs average class activation levels\nand the logits of the model. Based on the eight datasets, the correlation\ncoefficients through our method were all very close to 100%, and based on the\nfeature decomposition, 5%-25% of features could generate equally informative\nsaliency maps and obtain the same model performances as using all features.\nThis proves the reliability of the integrated feature analysis. As the proposed\nmethods rely on very few assumptions, this is a step towards better model\ninterpretation and a useful extension to existing CAM algorithms.

Presently, generative artificial intelligence (AI),\nrepresented by Large Model, heralds a technological revolution with the\npotential to fundamentally reshape traditional technological fields and human\nproduction methods. Its capabilities, including strong generalization,\nreasoning, and generative attributes, present opportunities to address PHM's\nbottlenecks.

Moreover, to address core issues confronting\nPHM, we discuss a series of technical challenges of PHM-LM throughout the\nentire process of construction and application. This comprehensive effort\noffers a holistic PHM-LM technical framework, and provides avenues for new PHM\ntechnologies, methodologies, tools, platforms and applications, which also\npotentially innovates design, research & development, verification and\napplication mode of PHM.

Despite the various FCE methods proposed earlier, these\nmethods are evaluated on datasets generated by specific Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Without a comprehensive benchmark, it remains unexplored how these FCE\nmethods perform on other LLMs with different error distributions or even unseen\nerror types, as these methods may fail to detect the error types generated by\nother LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the first comprehensive\nFCE benchmark \\emph{Face4RAG} for RAG independent of the underlying LLM. Our\nbenchmark consists of a synthetic dataset built upon a carefully designed\ntypology for factuality inconsistency error and a real-world dataset\nconstructed from six commonly used LLMs, enabling evaluation of FCE methods on\nspecific error types or real-world error distributions. On the proposed\nbenchmark, we discover the failure of existing FCE methods to detect the\nlogical fallacy, which refers to a mismatch of logic structures between the\nanswer and the retrieved reference. To fix this issue, we further propose a new\nmethod called \\emph{L-Face4RAG} with two novel designs of logic-preserving\nanswer decomposition and fact-logic FCE. Extensive experiments show L-Face4RAG\nsubstantially outperforms previous methods for factual inconsistency detection\non a wide range of tasks, notably beyond the RAG task from which it is\noriginally motivated.

    "abstract": "The conceptualization and categorization of natural objects in the human mind\nhave long intrigued cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, offering crucial\ninsights into human perception and cognition. Recently, the rapid development\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised the attractive question of whether\nthese models can also develop human-like object representations through\nexposure to vast amounts of linguistic and multimodal data. In this study, we\ncombined behavioral and neuroimaging analysis methods to uncover how the object\nconcept representations in LLMs correlate with those of humans. By collecting\nlarge-scale datasets of 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLM and Multimodal\nLLM (MLLM), we were able to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the\nunderlying similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting\n66-dimensional embeddings were found to be highly stable and predictive, and\nexhibited semantic clustering akin to human mental representations.\nInterestingly, the interpretability of the dimensions underlying these\nembeddings suggests that LLM and MLLM have developed human-like conceptual\nrepresentations of natural objects. Further analysis demonstrated strong\nalignment between the identified model embeddings and neural activity patterns\nin many functionally defined brain ROIs (e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC and FFA). This\nprovides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not\nidentical to those in the human, share fundamental commonalities that reflect\nkey schemas of human conceptual knowledge. This study advances our\nunderstanding of machine intelligence and informs the development of more\nhuman-like artificial cognitive systems.",

    "abstract": "While the animals' Fin-to-Limb evolution has been well-researched in biology,\nsuch morphological transformation remains under-adopted in the modern design of\nadvanced robotic limbs. This paper investigates a novel class of\noverconstrained locomotion from a design and learning perspective inspired by\nevolutionary morphology, aiming to integrate the concept of `intelligent design\nunder constraints' - hereafter referred to as constraint-driven design\nintelligence - in developing modern robotic limbs with superior energy\nefficiency. We propose a 3D-printable design of robotic limbs parametrically\nreconfigurable as a classical planar 4-bar linkage, an overconstrained Bennett\nlinkage, and a spherical 4-bar linkage. These limbs adopt a co-axial actuation,\nidentical to the modern legged robot platforms, with the added capability of\nupgrading into a wheel-legged system. Then, we implemented a large-scale,\nmulti-terrain deep reinforcement learning framework to train these\nreconfigurable limbs for a comparative analysis of overconstrained locomotion\nin energy efficiency. Results show that the overconstrained limbs exhibit more\nefficient locomotion than planar limbs during forward and sideways walking over\ndifferent terrains, including floors, slopes, and stairs, with or without\nrandom noises, by saving at least 22% mechanical energy in completing the\ntraverse task, with the spherical limbs being the least efficient. It also\nachieves the highest average speed of 0.85 meters per second on flat terrain,\nwhich is 20% faster than the planar limbs. This study paves the path for an\nexciting direction for future research in overconstrained robotics leveraging\nevolutionary morphology and reconfigurable mechanism intelligence when combined\nwith state-of-the-art methods in deep reinforcement learning.",

However, the effectiveness of these PEFT\nmethods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image\nanalysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of\nthe performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image\nclassification tasks.

We also find that\nthere are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models\nduring pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative\nimpact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to\nunderstand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator.

Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot\nmedical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process\nwithin highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

    "abstract": "The autonomous driving industry is increasingly adopting end-to-end learning\nfrom sensory inputs to minimize human biases in system design. Traditional\nend-to-end driving models, however, suffer from long-tail events due to rare or\nunseen inputs within their training distributions. To address this, we propose\nTOKEN, a novel Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MM-LLM) that tokenizes the\nworld into object-level knowledge, enabling better utilization of LLM's\nreasoning capabilities to enhance autonomous vehicle planning in long-tail\nscenarios. TOKEN effectively alleviates data scarcity and inefficient\ntokenization by leveraging a traditional end-to-end driving model to produce\ncondensed and semantically enriched representations of the scene, which are\noptimized for LLM planning compatibility through deliberate representation and\nreasoning alignment training stages. Our results demonstrate that TOKEN excels\nin grounding, reasoning, and planning capabilities, outperforming existing\nframeworks with a 27% reduction in trajectory L2 error and a 39% decrease in\ncollision rates in long-tail scenarios. Additionally, our work highlights the\nimportance of representation alignment and structured reasoning in sparking the\ncommon-sense reasoning capabilities of MM-LLMs for effective planning.",

    "abstract": "Edge-device co-inference, which concerns the cooperation between edge devices\nand an edge server for completing inference tasks over wireless networks, has\nbeen a promising technique for enabling various kinds of intelligent services\nat the network edge, e.g., auto-driving. In this paradigm, the concerned design\nobjective of the network shifts from the traditional communication throughput\nto the effective and efficient execution of the inference task underpinned by\nthe network, measured by, e.g., the inference accuracy and latency. In this\npaper, a task-oriented over-the-air computation scheme is proposed for a\nmultidevice artificial intelligence system. Particularly, a novel tractable\ninference accuracy metric is proposed for classification tasks, which is called\nminimum pair-wise discriminant gain. Unlike prior work measuring the average of\nall class pairs in feature space, it measures the minimum distance of all class\npairs. By maximizing the minimum pair-wise discriminant gain instead of its\naverage counterpart, any pair of classes can be better separated in the feature\nspace, and thus leading to a balanced and improved inference accuracy for all\nclasses. Besides, this paper jointly optimizes the minimum discriminant gain of\nall feature elements instead of separately maximizing that of each element in\nthe existing designs. As a result, the transmit power can be adaptively\nallocated to the feature elements according to their different contributions to\nthe inference accuracy, opening an extra degree of freedom to improve inference\nperformance. Extensive experiments are conducted using a concrete use case of\nhuman motion recognition to verify the superiority of the proposed design over\nthe benchmarking scheme.",

    "abstract": "(Source) code summarization aims to automatically generate succinct natural\nlanguage summaries for given code snippets. Such summaries play a significant\nrole in promoting developers to understand and maintain code. Inspired by\nneural machine translation, deep learning-based code summarization techniques\nwidely adopt an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder transforms given\ncode snippets into context vectors, and the decoder decodes context vectors\ninto summaries. Recently, large-scale pre-trained models for source code are\nequipped with encoders capable of producing general context vectors and have\nachieved substantial improvements on code summarization. However, although they\nare usually trained mainly on code-focused tasks and can capture general code\nfeatures, they still fall short in capturing specific features that need to be\nsummarized.\n  This paper proposes a novel approach to improve code summarization based on\nsummary-focused tasks. Specifically, we exploit a multi-task learning paradigm\nto train the encoder on three summary-focused tasks to enhance its ability to\nlearn code-summary alignment, including unidirectional language modeling (ULM),\nmasked language modeling (MLM), and action word prediction (AWP). Unlike\npre-trained models that mainly predict masked tokens in code snippets, we\ndesign ULM and MLM to predict masked words in summaries. Intuitively,\npredicting words based on given code snippets would help learn the code-summary\nalignment. Additionally, we introduce the domain-specific task AWP to enhance\nthe ability of the encoder to learn the alignment between action words and code\nsnippets. The extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our\napproach, called ESALE significantly outperforms baselines in all three widely\nused metrics, including BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L.",

    "abstract": "Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks identify the websites visited by users by\nperforming traffic analysis, compromising user privacy. Particularly, DL-based\nWF attacks demonstrate impressive attack performance. However, the\neffectiveness of DL-based WF attacks relies on the collected complete and pure\ntraffic during the page loading, which impacts the practicality of these\nattacks. The WF performance is rather low under dynamic network conditions and\nvarious WF defenses, particularly when the analyzed traffic is only a small\npart of the complete traffic. In this paper, we propose Holmes, a robust and\nreliable early-stage WF attack. Holmes utilizes temporal and spatial\ndistribution analysis of website traffic to effectively identify websites in\nthe early stages of page loading. Specifically, Holmes develops adaptive data\naugmentation based on the temporal distribution of website traffic and utilizes\na supervised contrastive learning method to extract the correlations between\nthe early-stage traffic and the pre-collected complete traffic. Holmes\naccurately identifies traffic in the early stages of page loading by computing\nthe correlation of the traffic with the spatial distribution information, which\nensures robust and reliable detection according to early-stage traffic. We\nextensively evaluate Holmes using six datasets. Compared to nine existing\nDL-based WF attacks, Holmes improves the F1-score of identifying early-stage\ntraffic by an average of 169.18%. Furthermore, we replay the traffic of\nvisiting real-world dark web websites. Holmes successfully identifies dark web\nwebsites when the ratio of page loading on average is only 21.71%, with an\naverage precision improvement of 169.36% over the existing WF attacks.",

Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching\nor its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks\n(circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and\nspecific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we\nintroduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build\ninterpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits of\narbitrary level of abstraction, and is the first able to produce circuits as\nfine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions efficiently.\nCD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of\nmodel features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a\ncomputational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to\nreduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets\n(indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring\ncompletion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better\nrecovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low\nruntimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits\nis not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than\nrandom circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T\ncircuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior\n(faithfulness $ = 1$) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our\nresults underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated\nmechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings\nof large language models.",

    "abstract": "We find that language models have difficulties generating fallacious and\ndeceptive reasoning. When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models\ntend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this\ndeficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned\nlanguage model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to\ngenerate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior.\nSince a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by\nLLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually\nharmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes\ntruthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language\nmodels, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach\nachieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the\nfindings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and\nhallucination.",

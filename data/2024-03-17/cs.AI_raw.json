    "abstract": "Recently, LLM-powered driver agents have demonstrated considerable potential\nin the field of autonomous driving, showcasing human-like reasoning and\ndecision-making abilities.However, current research on aligning driver agent\nbehaviors with human driving styles remains limited, partly due to the scarcity\nof high-quality natural language data from human driving behaviors.To address\nthis research gap, we propose a multi-alignment framework designed to align\ndriver agents with human driving styles through demonstrations and feedback.\nNotably, we construct a natural language dataset of human driver behaviors\nthrough naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving interviews, offering\nhigh-quality human demonstrations for LLM alignment. The framework's\neffectiveness is validated through simulation experiments in the CARLA urban\ntraffic simulator and further corroborated by human evaluations. Our research\noffers valuable insights into designing driving agents with diverse driving\nstyles.The implementation of the framework and details of the dataset can be\nfound at the link.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection is a critical component in predictive analytics that\nsignificantly affects the prediction accuracy and interpretability of models.\nIntrinsic methods for feature selection are built directly into model learning,\nproviding a fast and attractive option for large amounts of data. Machine\nlearning algorithms, such as penalized regression models (e.g., lasso) are the\nmost common choice when it comes to in-built feature selection. However, they\nfail to capture non-linear relationships, which ultimately affects their\nability to predict outcomes in intricate datasets. In this paper, we propose\nIGANN Sparse, a novel machine learning model from the family of generalized\nadditive models, which promotes sparsity through a non-linear feature selection\nprocess during training. This ensures interpretability through improved model\nsparsity without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, IGANN Sparse\nserves as an exploratory tool for information systems researchers to unveil\nimportant non-linear relationships in domains that are characterized by complex\npatterns. Our ongoing research is directed at a thorough evaluation of the\nIGANN Sparse model, including user studies that allow to assess how well users\nof the model can benefit from the reduced number of features. This will allow\nfor a deeper understanding of the interactions between linear vs. non-linear\nmodeling, number of selected features, and predictive performance.",

In fact, full\nsituational awareness of human motion could best be understood through a\ncombination of sensors. In this survey we investigate how knowledge can be\ntransferred and utilized amongst modalities for Human Activity/Action\nRecognition (HAR), i.e. cross-modality transfer learning. We motivate the\nimportance and potential of IMU data and its applicability in cross-modality\nlearning as well as the importance of studying the HAR problem. We categorize\nHAR related tasks by time and abstractness and then compare various types of\nmultimodal HAR datasets. We also distinguish and expound on many related but\ninconsistently used terms in the literature, such as transfer learning, domain\nadaptation, representation learning, sensor fusion, and multimodal learning,\nand describe how cross-modal learning fits with all these concepts. We then\nreview the literature in IMU-based cross-modal transfer for HAR. The two main\napproaches for cross-modal transfer are instance-based transfer, where\ninstances of one modality are mapped to another (e.g. knowledge is transferred\nin the input space), or feature-based transfer, where the model relates the\nmodalities in an intermediate latent space (e.g. knowledge is transferred in\nthe feature space).

However, even small adversarial\nperturbations during the inference can violate the exchangeability assumption,\nchallenge the coverage guarantees, and result in a subsequent decline in\nempirical coverage. In this work, we propose a certifiably robust\nlearning-reasoning conformal prediction framework (COLEP) via probabilistic\ncircuits, which comprise a data-driven learning component that trains\nstatistical models to learn different semantic concepts, and a reasoning\ncomponent that encodes knowledge and characterizes the relationships among the\ntrained models for logic reasoning. To achieve exact and efficient reasoning,\nwe employ probabilistic circuits (PCs) within the reasoning component.\nTheoretically, we provide end-to-end certification of prediction coverage for\nCOLEP in the presence of bounded adversarial perturbations. We also provide\ncertified coverage considering the finite size of the calibration set.\nFurthermore, we prove that COLEP achieves higher prediction coverage and\naccuracy over a single model as long as the utilities of knowledge models are\nnon-trivial. Empirically, we show the validity and tightness of our certified\ncoverage, demonstrating the robust conformal prediction of COLEP on various\ndatasets, including GTSRB, CIFAR10, and AwA2.

To develop an RL\nmethod that provably achieves a Nash equilibrium, we focus on a\nlinear-quadratic structure. Moreover, to tackle the non-stationarity induced by\nmulti-agent interactions in the finite population setting, we consider the case\nwhere the number of agents within each team is infinite, i.e., the mean-field\nsetting. This results in a General-Sum LQ Mean-Field Type Game (GS-MFTG). We\ncharacterize the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the GS-MFTG, under a standard\ninvertibility condition. This MFTG NE is then shown to be $O(1/M)$-NE for the\nfinite population game where $M$ is a lower bound on the number of agents in\neach team. These structural results motivate an algorithm called Multi-player\nReceding-horizon Natural Policy Gradient (MRNPG), where each team minimizes its\ncumulative cost \\emph{independently} in a receding-horizon manner. Despite the\nnon-convexity of the problem, we establish that the resulting algorithm\nconverges to a global NE through a novel problem decomposition into\nsub-problems using backward recursive discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs\n(HJI) equations, in which \\emph{independent natural policy gradient} is shown\nto exhibit linear convergence under time-independent diagonal dominance.\nNumerical studies included corroborate the theoretical results.",

Identifying players from broadcast videos can aid with various\ndownstream tasks such as player assessment, in-game analysis, and broadcast\nproduction. However, automatic detection of jersey numbers using deep features\nis challenging primarily due to: a) motion blur, b) low resolution video feed,\nand c) occlusions. With their recent success in various vision tasks, masked\nautoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a superior alternative to conventional\nfeature extractors. However, most MAEs simply zero-out image patches either\nrandomly or focus on where to mask rather than how to mask.

A state represents the status of a running process. The\ntransitions between states are controlled by heuristic rules or decisions made\nby the LLM, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive progression. Upon entering a\nstate, a series of actions is executed, involving not only calling LLMs guided\nby different prompts, but also the utilization of external tools as needed. Our\nresults show that StateFlow significantly enhances LLMs' efficiency.

As for human drivers, predicting the motions of surrounding\nvehicles is important to plan the own actions. Recent motion prediction methods\nutilize equivariant neural networks to exploit geometric symmetries in the\nscene. However, no existing method combines motion prediction and trajectory\nplanning in a joint step while guaranteeing equivariance under\nroto-translations of the input space. We address this gap by proposing a\nlightweight equivariant planning model that generates multi-modal joint\npredictions for all vehicles and selects one mode as the ego plan. The\nequivariant network design improves sample efficiency, guarantees output\nstability, and reduces model parameters. We further propose equivariant route\nattraction to guide the ego vehicle along a high-level route provided by an\noff-the-shelf GPS navigation system. This module creates a momentum from\nembedded vehicle positions toward the route in latent space while keeping the\nequivariance property. Route attraction enables goal-oriented behavior without\nforcing the vehicle to stick to the exact route. We conduct experiments on the\nchallenging nuScenes dataset to investigate the capability of our planner.

However, bridging the gap\nbetween the pre-trained vision encoder and the large language models (LLMs)\nbecomes the whole network's bottleneck. To improve cross-modality alignment,\nexisting works usually consider more visual instruction data covering a broader\nrange of vision tasks to fine-tune the model for question-answering, which,\nhowever, is costly to obtain and has not thoroughly explored the rich\ncontextual information contained in images. This paper first attempts to\nharness the overlooked context within visual instruction data, training the\nmodel to self-supervised \"learning\" how to ask high-quality questions. In this\nway, we introduce a novel framework named SQ-LLaVA: Self-Questioning for Large\nVision-Language Assistant. SQ-LLaVA exhibits proficiency in generating flexible\nand meaningful image-related questions while analyzing the visual clue and\nprior language knowledge, signifying an advanced level of generalized visual\nunderstanding. Moreover, fine-tuning SQ-LLaVA on higher-quality instruction\ndata shows a performance improvement compared with traditional\nvisual-instruction tuning methods. This improvement highlights the efficacy of\nself-questioning techniques in achieving a deeper and more nuanced\ncomprehension of visual content across various contexts.",

The issue becomes even more\nnoticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning\nsteps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods\nare capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of\nknowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge\ngraph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how\nto integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way\nso as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the\nincompleteness issue of knowledge graphs.

LGOT seamlessly combines\nknowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic\nqueries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both\nknowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each\nsubquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality\ncandidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex\nquestions.

Existing\nalgorithms take a long time to solve high-dimensional problems with significant\nuncertainty scenarios. Therefore, an efficient approach is required to maximize\nthe quality of service while considering all technical constraints. One of\nthese approaches is machine learning, which emulates optimal solutions for\napplication placement in edge servers. Machine learning models are expected to\nlearn how to allocate user requests to servers based on the spatial positions\nof users and servers. In this study, the problem is formulated as a two-stage\nstochastic programming. A sufficient amount of training records is generated by\nvarying parameters such as user locations, their request rates, and solving the\noptimization model. Then, based on the distance features of each user from the\navailable servers and their request rates, machine learning models generate\ndecision variables for the first stage of the stochastic optimization model,\nwhich is the user-to-server request allocation, and are employed as independent\ndecision agents that reliably mimic the optimization model. Support Vector\nMachines (SVM) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) are used in this research to\nachieve practical decisions from the stochastic optimization models. The\nperformance of each model has shown an execution effectiveness of over 80%.\nThis research aims to provide a more efficient approach for tackling\nhigh-dimensional problems and scenarios with uncertainties in mobile edge\ncomputing by leveraging machine learning models for optimal decision-making in\nrequest allocation to edge servers.

In recent decades, the\nrapid development of mathematical and computational tools has provided new\ntheoretical and technical means for exploring causality, creating more avenues\nfor investigation.\n  Based on this, this paper introduces a new definition of causality using\ncategory theory, proposed by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in 1945 to\navoid the self-referential contradictions in set theory, notably the Russell\nparadox. Within this framework, the feasibility of indicator synthesis in\ncausal inference is demonstrated. Due to the limitations in the development of\ncategory theory-related technical tools, this paper adopts the widely-used\nprobabilistic causal graph tool proposed by Judea Pearl in 1995 to study the\napplication of causal inference in personal credit risk management.

    "abstract": "Reconstructions of visual perception from brain activity have improved\ntremendously, but the practical utility of such methods has been limited. This\nis because such models are trained independently per subject where each subject\nrequires dozens of hours of expensive fMRI training data to attain high-quality\nresults. The present work showcases high-quality reconstructions using only 1\nhour of fMRI training data. We pretrain our model across 7 subjects and then\nfine-tune on minimal data from a new subject. Our novel functional alignment\nprocedure linearly maps all brain data to a shared-subject latent space,\nfollowed by a shared non-linear mapping to CLIP image space. We then map from\nCLIP space to pixel space by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion XL to accept CLIP\nlatents as inputs instead of text. This approach improves out-of-subject\ngeneralization with limited training data and also attains state-of-the-art\nimage retrieval and reconstruction metrics compared to single-subject\napproaches. MindEye2 demonstrates how accurate reconstructions of perception\nare possible from a single visit to the MRI facility. All code is available on\nGitHub.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of extensive neural network architectures, particularly\ndeep learning models, presents a challenge in terms of resource-intensive\ntraining. GPU memory constraints have become a notable bottleneck in training\nsuch sizable models. Existing strategies, including data parallelism, model\nparallelism, pipeline parallelism, and fully sharded data parallelism, offer\npartial solutions. Model parallelism, in particular, enables the distribution\nof the entire model across multiple GPUs, yet the ensuing data communication\nbetween these partitions slows down training. Additionally, the substantial\nmemory overhead required to store auxiliary parameters on each GPU compounds\ncomputational demands. Instead of using the entire model for training, this\nstudy advocates partitioning the model across GPUs and generating synthetic\nintermediate labels to train individual segments. These labels, produced\nthrough a random process, mitigate memory overhead and computational load. This\napproach results in a more efficient training process that minimizes data\ncommunication while maintaining model accuracy. To validate this method, a\n6-layer fully connected neural network is partitioned into two parts and its\nperformance is assessed on the extended MNIST dataset. Experimental results\nindicate that the proposed approach achieves similar testing accuracies to\nconventional training methods, while significantly reducing memory and\ncomputational requirements. This work contributes to mitigating the\nresource-intensive nature of training large neural networks, paving the way for\nmore efficient deep learning model development.",

This paper proposes an automated design-data augmentation\nframework, which generates high-volume and high-quality natural language\naligned with Verilog and EDA scripts. For Verilog generation, it translates\nVerilog files to an abstract syntax tree and then maps nodes to natural\nlanguage with a predefined template. For Verilog repair, it uses predefined\nrules to generate the wrong verilog file and then pairs EDA Tool feedback with\nthe right and wrong verilog file. For EDA Script generation, it uses existing\nLLM(GPT-3.5) to obtain the description of the Script. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of our data augmentation method, we finetune Llama2-13B and\nLlama2-7B models using the dataset generated by our augmentation framework. The\nresults demonstrate a significant improvement in the Verilog generation tasks\nwith LLMs. Moreover, the accuracy of Verilog generation surpasses that of the\ncurrent state-of-the-art open-source Verilog generation model, increasing from\n58.8% to 70.6% with the same benchmark.

High-quality and timely correction of misinformation\nthat identifies and explains its (in)accuracies effectively reduces false\nbeliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to\nbe timely and scalable. While LLMs have versatile capabilities that could\naccelerate misinformation correction, they struggle due to a lack of recent\ninformation, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing\nmultimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and\ncredibility evaluation of up-to-date information.

It conducts multimodal retrieval and interprets\nvisual content to verify and correct multimodal content.

Nonetheless, a straightforward comparison between\ntheir impact is absent. In this work, we first control the diversity of both\nsides according to the number of samples for fine-tuning, which can directly\nreflect their influence.

Although great progress has been witnessed, we experimentally reveal\nthat current methods reach marginal performance gain within the use of the\nunlabeled frames, leading to the underutilization issue. To fully explore the\npotential of the unlabeled frames for AVS, we explicitly divide them into two\ncategories based on their temporal characteristics, i.e., neighboring frame\n(NF) and distant frame (DF). NFs, temporally adjacent to the labeled frame,\noften contain rich motion information that assists in the accurate localization\nof sounding objects. Contrary to NFs, DFs have long temporal distances from the\nlabeled frame, which share semantic-similar objects with appearance variations.\nConsidering their unique characteristics, we propose a versatile framework that\neffectively leverages them to tackle AVS. Specifically, for NFs, we exploit the\nmotion cues as the dynamic guidance to improve the objectness localization.\nBesides, we exploit the semantic cues in DFs by treating them as valid\naugmentations to the labeled frames, which are then used to enrich data\ndiversity in a self-training manner.

    "abstract": "The advent of ChatGPT has sparked over a year of regulatory frenzy. However,\nfew existing studies have rigorously questioned the assumption that, if left\nunregulated, AI chatbot's output would inflict tangible, severe real harm on\nhuman affairs. Most researchers have overlooked the critical possibility that\nthe information market itself can effectively mitigate these risks and, as a\nresult, they tend to use regulatory tools to address the issue directly. This\nArticle develops a yardstick for reevaluating both AI-related content risks and\ncorresponding regulatory proposals by focusing on inter-informational\ncompetition among various outlets. The decades-long history of regulating\ninformation and communications technologies indicates that regulators tend to\nerr too much on the side of caution and to put forward excessive regulatory\nmeasures when encountering the uncertainties brought about by new technologies.\nIn fact, a trove of empirical evidence has demonstrated that market competition\namong information outlets can effectively mitigate most risks and that\noverreliance on regulation is not only unnecessary but detrimental, as well.\nThis Article argues that sufficient competition among chatbots and other\ninformation outlets in the information marketplace can sufficiently mitigate\nand even resolve most content risks posed by generative AI technologies. This\nrenders certain loudly advocated regulatory strategies, like mandatory\nprohibitions, licensure, curation of datasets, and notice-and-response regimes,\ntruly unnecessary and even toxic to desirable competition and innovation\nthroughout the AI industry. Ultimately, the ideas that I advance in this\nArticle should pour some much-needed cold water on the regulatory frenzy over\ngenerative AI and steer the issue back to a rational track.",

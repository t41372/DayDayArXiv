    "abstract": "Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating FreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often complex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid prototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate initial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed and refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of experiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this approach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating multiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory retrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance script robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution and exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation. This work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in design workflows while identifying critical areas for future development.",

Hence, the model is fully transparent and it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in Artificial Neural Networks.

As the key technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning, have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing, along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference (NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models (4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient techniques in highly specialised domains.",

The methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames, physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to 19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual understanding for autonomous driving applications.",

The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.",

RLHF remains dominant for alignment, and outcome-based RL such as RLVR significantly improves stepwise reasoning.

    "abstract": "Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has emerged as a vital complementary approach that operates in the early phases of the cyber threat lifecycle. CTI involves collecting, processing, and analyzing threat data to provide a more accurate and rapid understanding of cyber threats. Due to the large volume of data, automation through Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models is essential for effective CTI extraction. These automated systems leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from sources like social networks, forums, and blogs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Although prior research has focused on adversarial attacks on specific ML models, this study expands the scope by investigating vulnerabilities within various components of the entire CTI pipeline and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. These vulnerabilities arise because they ingest textual inputs from various open sources, including real and potentially fake content. We analyse three types of attacks against CTI pipelines, including evasion, flooding, and poisoning, and assess their impact on the system's information selection capabilities. Specifically, on fake text generation, the work demonstrates how adversarial text generation techniques can create fake cybersecurity and cybersecurity-like text that misleads classifiers, degrades performance, and disrupts system functionality. The focus is primarily on the evasion attack, as it precedes and enables flooding and poisoning attacks within the CTI pipeline.",

By effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition, EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as an end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object detection tasks for AVs.

    "abstract": "Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically, inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers. Code is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc.",

Data poisoning - the intentional manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP) threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm. Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at https://github.com/stapaw/STP.git .",

    "abstract": "LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics. To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy. I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer, interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.",

This chapter aims to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI, this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.",

    "abstract": "The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's performance. Recent approaches, such as $Δ$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.",

However, conventional RAG methods retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.",

Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK, highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare, government, finance, and education.",

    "abstract": "Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.

However, challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions (IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters. In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.",

Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses twice as fast as Qwen3-235B.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions. Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive, adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.",

We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.",

To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately.

Through principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming all selected baselines.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness. Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown particular promise, as these internal representations encode information relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise, enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why the results are inconclusive.",

Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness, enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks. Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to 63\\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention, despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.",

This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.",

This makes them vulnerable to attacks and motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to attestation by 30%.",

Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch, which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption. In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.",

    "abstract": "The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.",

    "abstract": "Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a given unsatisfiable formula.\n  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called \"CortexDebate\". Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results across eight datasets from four task types.",

However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation, and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA), supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and 0.7% and 1.4% at 10%.

However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos, collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually created test set of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based dynamic slide generation.",

Early detection of AD is critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early diagnosis and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Feature interaction modeling is crucial for deep recommendation models. A common and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to enhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these combinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful feature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While feature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically limited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for high-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due to the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature combinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\\textbf{TayFCS}$, a lightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves model performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer (TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead of evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly running experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to approximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can be simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation model. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and their sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which estimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B test results demonstrate its practical applicability and commercial value.",

    "abstract": "While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency. Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF) framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.",

We develop an automated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world MCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal that network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438 and 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less frequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API Development plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins often contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case studies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege escalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these findings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify security-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer MCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust assessment.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function, such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) -- represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT), which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future work in cognitive science should engage.",

In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables using an auxiliary LLM.

As agents and their environments grow more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of autonomous agents.",

However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.",

    "abstract": "Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions, autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers. Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to traditional solvers.

    "abstract": "Current AI agent architectures suffer from ephemeral memory limitations, preventing effective collaboration and knowledge sharing across sessions and agent boundaries. We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a novel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable memory sharing among AI agents. Our protocol addresses three critical challenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2) secure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3) efficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a distributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic access controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing agent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness across diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare AI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental results show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in context relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements including audit trail generation. SAMEP enables a new paradigm of persistent, collaborative AI agent ecosystems while maintaining security and privacy guarantees.",

This research presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency.

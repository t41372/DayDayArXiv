We refer to this as\ndownstream safety. In contrast, work on safety of frontier AI, e.g. large\nlanguage models which can be further trained for downstream tasks, typically\nconsiders factors that are beyond specific application contexts, such as the\nability of the model to evade human control, or to produce harmful content,\ne.g. how to make bombs. We refer to this as upstream safety. We outline the\ncharacteristics of both upstream and downstream safety frameworks then explore\nthe extent to which the broad AI safety community can benefit from synergies\nbetween these frameworks. For example, can concepts such as common mode\nfailures from downstream safety be used to help assess the strength of AI\nguardrails? Further, can the understanding of the capabilities and limitations\nof frontier AI be used to inform downstream safety analysis, e.g. where LLMs\nare fine-tuned to calculate voyage plans for autonomous vessels?

      "abstract": "If today some African languages like Swahili have enough resources to develop\nhigh-performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, many other languages\nspoken on the continent are still lacking such support. For these languages,\nstill in their infancy, several possibilities exist to address this critical\nlack of data. Among them is Transfer Learning, which allows low-resource\nlanguages to benefit from the good representation of other languages that are\nsimilar to them. In this work, we adopt a similar approach, aiming to pioneer\nNLP technologies for Comorian, a group of four languages or dialects belonging\nto the Bantu family.\n  Our approach is initially motivated by the hypothesis that if a human can\nunderstand a different language from their native language with little or no\neffort, it would be entirely possible to model this process on a machine. To\nachieve this, we consider ways to construct Comorian datasets mixed with\nSwahili. One thing to note here is that in terms of Swahili data, we only focus\non elements that are closest to Comorian by calculating lexical distances\nbetween candidate and source data. We empirically test this hypothesis in two\nuse cases: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). Our\nMT model achieved ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.6826, 0.42, and\n0.6532, respectively, while our ASR system recorded a WER of 39.50\\% and a CER\nof 13.76\\%. This research is crucial for advancing NLP in underrepresented\nlanguages, with potential to preserve and promote Comorian linguistic heritage\nin the digital age.",

And how can we do so while accounting for their\nlimitations, which are themselves only poorly understood? We develop an\neconometric framework to answer this question that distinguishes between two\ntypes of empirical tasks. Using LLMs for prediction problems (including\nhypothesis generation) is valid under one condition: no ``leakage'' between the\nLLM's training dataset and the researcher's sample. No leakage can be ensured\nby using open-source LLMs with documented training data and published weights.\nUsing LLM outputs for estimation problems to automate the measurement of some\neconomic concept (expressed either by some text or from human subjects)\nrequires the researcher to collect at least some validation data: without such\ndata, the errors of the LLM's automation cannot be assessed and accounted for.\nAs long as these steps are taken, LLM outputs can be used in empirical research\nwith the familiar econometric guarantees we desire. Using two illustrative\napplications to finance and political economy, we find that these requirements\nare stringent; when they are violated, the limitations of LLMs now result in\nunreliable empirical estimates. Our results suggest the excitement around the\nempirical uses of LLMs is warranted -- they allow researchers to effectively\nuse even small amounts of language data for both prediction and estimation --\nbut only with these safeguards in place.",

We propose constrained decoding with\nspeculative lookaheads (CDSL), a technique that significantly improves upon the\ninference efficiency of CDLH without experiencing the drastic performance\nreduction seen with greedy decoding. CDSL is motivated by the recently proposed\nidea of speculative decoding that uses a much smaller draft LLM for generation\nand a larger target LLM for verification. In CDSL, the draft model is used to\ngenerate lookaheads which is verified by a combination of target LLM and\ntask-specific reward functions. This process accelerates decoding by reducing\nthe computational burden while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate CDSL\nin two constraint decoding tasks with three LLM families and achieve 2.2x to\n12.15x speedup over CDLH without significant performance reduction.",

In response, we propose a novel, simple, and more\neffective parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that does not rely on LoRA.\nOur approach introduces a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer between two\nexisting MLP layers the up proj (the FFN projection layer following the\nself-attention module) and down proj within the feed forward network of the\ntransformer block.

      "abstract": "Foundation Models (FMs) trained on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have\nachieved state-of-the-art results on numerous clinical prediction tasks.\nHowever, most existing EHR FMs have context windows of <1k tokens. This\nprevents them from modeling full patient EHRs which can exceed 10k's of events.\nRecent advancements in subquadratic long-context architectures (e.g., Mamba)\noffer a promising solution. However, their application to EHR data has not been\nwell-studied. We address this gap by presenting the first systematic evaluation\nof the effect of context length on modeling EHR data. We find that longer\ncontext models improve predictive performance -- our Mamba-based model\nsurpasses the prior state-of-the-art on 9/14 tasks on the EHRSHOT prediction\nbenchmark. For clinical applications, however, model performance alone is\ninsufficient -- robustness to the unique properties of EHR is crucial. Thus, we\nalso evaluate models across three previously underexplored properties of EHR\ndata: (1) the prevalence of \"copy-forwarded\" diagnoses which creates artificial\nrepetition of tokens within EHR sequences; (2) the irregular time intervals\nbetween EHR events which can lead to a wide range of timespans within a context\nwindow; and (3) the natural increase in disease complexity over time which\nmakes later tokens in the EHR harder to predict than earlier ones. Stratifying\nour EHRSHOT results, we find that higher levels of each property correlate\nnegatively with model performance, but that longer context models are more\nrobust to more extreme levels of these properties. Our work highlights the\npotential for using long-context architectures to model EHR data, and offers a\ncase study for identifying new challenges in modeling sequential data motivated\nby domains outside of natural language.

However, the current approach to LLM function calling is\ninherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM\noperation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM,\na system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's\noperational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls\nconcurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces\nan interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function\ncalls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and\ninterrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt\nsemantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process.\nWe demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from\n1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks\nin the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL).

We present a case study of a team of teenagers\nengaging with each step during an out-of-school workshop in which they audited\npeer-designed generative AI TikTok filters. We discuss the kind of scaffolds we\nprovided to support youth in algorithm auditing and directions and challenges\nfor integrating algorithm auditing into classroom activities. This paper\ncontributes: (a) a conceptualization of five steps to scaffold algorithm\nauditing learning activities, and (b) examples of how youth engaged with each\nstep during our pilot study.",

      "abstract": "Mental health disorders are increasingly prevalent worldwide, creating an\nurgent need for innovative tools to support early diagnosis and intervention.\nThis study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal\nmental health diagnostics, specifically for detecting depression and Post\nTraumatic Stress Disorder through text and audio modalities. Using the E-DAIC\ndataset, we compare text and audio modalities to investigate whether LLMs can\nperform equally well or better with audio inputs. We further examine the\nintegration of both modalities to determine if this can enhance diagnostic\naccuracy, which generally results in improved performance metrics. Our analysis\nspecifically utilizes custom-formulated metrics; Modal Superiority Score and\nDisagreement Resolvement Score to evaluate how combined modalities influence\nmodel performance. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model achieves the highest scores in\nbinary depression classification when using the combined modality, with an F1\nscore of 0.67 and a Balanced Accuracy (BA) of 77.4%, assessed across the full\ndataset. These results represent an increase of 3.1% over its performance with\nthe text modality and 2.7% over the audio modality, highlighting the\neffectiveness of integrating modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy.\nNotably, all results are obtained in zero-shot inferring, highlighting the\nrobustness of the models without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. To\nexplore the impact of different configurations on model performance, we conduct\nbinary, severity, and multiclass tasks using both zero-shot and few-shot\nprompts, examining the effects of prompt variations on performance. The results\nreveal that models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro in text and audio modalities, and\nGPT-4o mini in the text modality, often surpass other models in balanced\naccuracy and F1 scores across multiple tasks.",

At its core are multi-view\ndecoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while\nconsidering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view\nselection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view\nblocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further\nenable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training\nGaussian splatting heads.

These aspirations are both\nnumerous and varied, motivated by issues that pertain to privacy, copyright,\nsafety, and more. For example, unlearning is often invoked as a solution for\nremoving the effects of targeted information from a generative-AI model's\nparameters, e.g., a particular individual's personal data or in-copyright\nexpression of Spiderman that was included in the model's training data.\nUnlearning is also proposed as a way to prevent a model from generating\ntargeted types of information in its outputs, e.g., generations that closely\nresemble a particular individual's data or reflect the concept of \"Spiderman.\"\nBoth of these goals--the targeted removal of information from a model and the\ntargeted suppression of information from a model's outputs--present various\ntechnical and substantive challenges. We provide a framework for thinking\nrigorously about these challenges, which enables us to be clear about why\nunlearning is not a general-purpose solution for circumscribing generative-AI\nmodel behavior in service of broader positive impact.

Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-based neural network models, such as convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) are capable of analyzing colonoscopies to diagnose and\ndetermine the severity of UC by modeling colonoscopy analysis as a multi-class\nclassification problem. Prior research for AI-based UC diagnosis relies on\nsupervised learning approaches that require large annotated datasets to train\nthe CNNs. However, creating such datasets necessitates that domain experts\ninvest a significant amount of time, rendering the process expensive and\nchallenging. To address the challenge, this research employs self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) frameworks that can efficiently train on unannotated datasets to\nanalyze colonoscopies and, aid in diagnosing UC and its severity. A comparative\nanalysis with supervised learning models shows that SSL frameworks, such as\nSwAV and SparK outperform supervised learning models on the LIMUC dataset, the\nlargest publicly available annotated dataset of colonoscopy images for UC.",

However, collecting bimanual manipulation data is\nexpensive due to the high-dimensional action space, which poses challenges for\nconventional methods to handle general bimanual manipulation tasks. In\ncontrast, unimanual policy has recently demonstrated impressive\ngeneralizability across a wide range of tasks because of scaled model\nparameters and training data, which can provide sharable manipulation knowledge\nfor bimanual systems. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play method named\nAnyBimanual, which transfers pre-trained unimanual policy to general bimanual\nmanipulation policy with few bimanual demonstrations. Specifically, we first\nintroduce a skill manager to dynamically schedule the skill representations\ndiscovered from pre-trained unimanual policy for bimanual manipulation tasks,\nwhich linearly combines skill primitives with task-oriented compensation to\nrepresent the bimanual manipulation instruction. To mitigate the observation\ndiscrepancy between unimanual and bimanual systems, we present a visual aligner\nto generate soft masks for visual embedding of the workspace, which aims to\nalign visual input of unimanual policy model for each arm with those during\npretraining stage.

Most existing methods rely on depth estimation\nthrough self-supervision or multi-modality sensor fusion. In this paper, we\npropose Driv3R, a DUSt3R-based framework that directly regresses per-frame\npoint maps from multi-view image sequences. To achieve streaming dense\nreconstruction, we maintain a memory pool to reason both spatial relationships\nacross sensors and dynamic temporal contexts to enhance multi-view 3D\nconsistency and temporal integration. Furthermore, we employ a 4D flow\npredictor to identify moving objects within the scene to direct our network\nfocus more on reconstructing these dynamic regions. Finally, we align all\nper-frame pointmaps consistently to the world coordinate system in an\noptimization-free manner. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale\nnuScenes dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Driv3R\noutperforms previous frameworks in 4D dynamic scene reconstruction, achieving\n15x faster inference speed compared to methods requiring global alignment.\nCode: https://github.com/Barrybarry-Smith/Driv3R.",

To address this, recent approaches apply contrastive\ndecoding to calibrate the model's response via contrasting output distributions\nwith original and visually distorted samples, demonstrating promising\nhallucination mitigation in a training-free manner. However, the potential of\nchanging information in visual inputs is not well-explored, so a deeper\ninvestigation into the behaviors of visual contrastive decoding is of great\ninterest. In this paper, we first explore various methods for contrastive\ndecoding to change visual contents, including image downsampling and editing.\nDownsampling images reduces the detailed textual information while editing\nyields new contents in images, providing new aspects as visual contrastive\nsamples. To further study benefits by using different contrastive samples, we\nanalyze probability-level metrics, including entropy and distribution distance.\nInterestingly, the effect of these samples in mitigating hallucinations varies\na lot across LVLMs and benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to combine contrastive samples, offering a practical\nsolution for applying contrastive decoding across various scenarios.

Unlike\ntraditional methods that prioritize either high-level semantics (e.g., CLIP) or\npixel-level reconstruction (e.g., VAE), ViLex simultaneously captures rich\nsemantic content and fine visual details, enabling high-quality image\ngeneration and comprehensive visual scene understanding. Through a\nself-supervised learning pipeline, ViLex generates tokens optimized for\nreconstructing input images using a frozen text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model,\npreserving the detailed information necessary for high-fidelity semantic-level\nreconstruction. As an image embedding in the language space, ViLex tokens\nleverage the compositionality of natural languages, allowing them to be used\nindependently as \"text tokens\" or combined with natural language tokens to\nprompt pretrained T2I models with both visual and textual inputs, mirroring how\nwe interact with vision-language models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that\nViLex achieves higher fidelity in image reconstruction compared to text\nembeddings--even with a single ViLex token. Moreover, ViLex successfully\nperforms various DreamBooth tasks in a zero-shot, unsupervised manner without\nfine-tuning T2I models. Additionally, ViLex serves as a powerful vision\nencoder, consistently improving vision-language model performance across 15\nbenchmarks relative to a strong SigLIP baseline.",

We build simple prototypes for such agents and\nverify their effectiveness through both human studies and automated evaluation.\nWe observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their\nbelief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow.

      "abstract": "Deep learning holds tremendous potential in healthcare for uncovering hidden\npatterns within extensive clinical datasets, aiding in the diagnosis of various\ndiseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition\ncharacterized by the deterioration of brain function. In the initial stages of\nPD, automatic diagnosis poses a challenge due to the similarity in behavior\nbetween individuals with PD and those who are healthy. Our objective is to\npropose an effective model that can aid in the early detection of Parkinson's\ndisease. We employed the VGRF gait signal dataset sourced from Physionet for\ndistinguishing between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Parkinson's\ndisease. This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture based on the\nLSTM network for automatically detecting freezing of gait episodes in\nParkinson's disease patients. In contrast to conventional machine learning\nalgorithms, this method eliminates manual feature engineering and proficiently\ncaptures prolonged temporal dependencies in gait patterns, thereby improving\nthe diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The LSTM network resolves the issue of\nvanishing gradients by employing memory blocks in place of self-connected\nhidden units, allowing for optimal information assimilation. To prevent\noverfitting, dropout and L2 regularization techniques have been employed.\nAdditionally, the stochastic gradient-based optimizer Adam is used for the\noptimization process. The results indicate that our proposed approach surpasses\ncurrent state-of-the-art models in FOG episode detection, achieving an accuracy\nof 97.71%, sensitivity of 99%, precision of 98%, and specificity of 96%. This\ndemonstrates its potential as a superior classification method for Parkinson's\ndisease detection.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in learning decision-making policies can largely be\nattributed to training expressive policy models, largely via imitation\nlearning. While imitation learning discards non-expert data, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can still learn from suboptimal data. However, instantiating RL\ntraining of a new policy class often presents a different challenge: most deep\nRL machinery is co-developed with assumptions on the policy class and backbone,\nresulting in poor performance when the policy class changes. For instance, SAC\nutilizes a low-variance reparameterization policy gradient for Gaussian\npolicies, but this is unstable for diffusion policies and intractable for\nautoregressive categorical policies. To address this issue, we develop an\noffline RL and online fine-tuning approach called policy-agnostic RL (PA-RL)\nthat can effectively train multiple policy classes, with varying architectures\nand sizes. We build off the basic idea that a universal supervised learning\nloss can replace the policy improvement step in RL, as long as it is applied on\n\"optimized\" actions. To obtain these optimized actions, we first sample\nmultiple actions from a base policy, and run global optimization (i.e.,\nre-ranking multiple action samples using the Q-function) and local optimization\n(i.e., running gradient steps on an action sample) to maximize the critic on\nthese candidates. PA-RL enables fine-tuning diffusion and transformer policies\nwith either autoregressive tokens or continuous action outputs, at different\nsizes, entirely via actor-critic RL. Moreover, PA-RL improves the performance\nand sample-efficiency by up to 2 times compared to existing offline RL and\nonline fine-tuning methods. We show the first result that successfully\nfine-tunes OpenVLA, a 7B generalist robot policy, autonomously with Cal-QL, an\nonline RL fine-tuning algorithm, improving from 40% to 70% in the real world in\n40 minutes.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the AI-powered grading tool \"AI Grading Assistant\" by the\nGerman company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing\nfeedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an\noverburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial\nintelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the\ntool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal\nsignificant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback\nare often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated.\nThe highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False\nclaims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the\nimplementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these\ndeficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models\n(LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately\nforeseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick\nfix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of\nthe tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and\nirresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and\nsubject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational\ncontexts.",

Diverse training protocols often\nresult in significantly different feature spaces, which are usually compared\nthrough alignment analysis. However, current alignment measures quantify this\nrelationship in terms of a single scalar value, obscuring the distinctions\nbetween common and unique features in pairs of representations that share the\nsame scalar alignment. We address this limitation by combining alignment\nanalysis with concept discovery, which enables a breakdown of alignment into\nsingle concepts encoded in feature space. This fine-grained comparison reveals\nboth universal and unique concepts across different representations, as well as\nthe internal structure of concepts within each of them. Our methodological\ncontributions address two key prerequisites for concept-based alignment: 1) For\na description of the representation in terms of concepts that faithfully\ncapture the geometry of the feature space, we define concepts as the most\ngeneral structure they can possibly form - arbitrary manifolds, allowing hidden\nfeatures to be described by their proximity to these manifolds. 2) To measure\ndistances between concept proximity scores of two representations, we use a\ngeneralized Rand index and partition it for alignment between pairs of\nconcepts. We confirm the superiority of our novel concept definition for\nalignment analysis over existing linear baselines in a sanity check. The\nconcept-based alignment analysis of representations from four different ViTs\nreveals that increased supervision correlates with a reduction in the semantic\nstructure of learned representations.",

The traditional\nmethods based on model compression have achieved great success, especially VQ\ntechnology which realizes the high compression ratio of models by sharing code\nwords. However, because each layer of the network needs to build a code table,\nthe traditional top-down compression technology lacks attention to the\nunderlying commonalities, resulting in limited compression rate and frequent\nmemory access. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up method to share the\nuniversal codebook among multiple neural networks, which not only effectively\nreduces the number of codebooks but also further reduces the memory access and\nchip area by storing static code tables in the built-in ROM. Specifically, we\nintroduce VQ4ALL, a VQ-based method that utilizes codewords to enable the\nconstruction of various neural networks and achieve efficient representations.\nThe core idea of our method is to adopt a kernel density estimation approach to\nextract a universal codebook and then progressively construct different low-bit\nnetworks by updating differentiable assignments. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that VQ4ALL achieves compression rates exceeding 16 $\\times$ while\npreserving high accuracy across multiple network architectures, highlighting\nits effectiveness and versatility.",

      "abstract": "Advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have significantly improved the\nquality of generated speech, closely matching the timbre and intonation of the\ntarget speaker. However, due to the inherent complexity of human emotional\nexpression, the development of TTS systems capable of controlling subtle\nemotional differences remains a formidable challenge. Existing emotional speech\ndatabases often suffer from overly simplistic labelling schemes that fail to\ncapture a wide range of emotional states, thus limiting the effectiveness of\nemotion synthesis in TTS applications. To this end, recent efforts have\nfocussed on building databases that use natural language annotations to\ndescribe speech emotions. However, these approaches are costly and require more\nemotional depth to train robust systems. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprocess aimed at building databases by systematically extracting emotion-rich\nspeech segments and annotating them with detailed natural language descriptions\nthrough a generative model. This approach enhances the emotional granularity of\nthe database and significantly reduces the reliance on costly manual\nannotations by automatically augmenting the data with high-level language\nmodels. The resulting rich database provides a scalable and economically viable\nsolution for developing a more nuanced and dynamic basis for developing\nemotionally controlled TTS systems.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in\nmathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on\ncompetition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a\nstep-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models\nare required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude\nthat all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench,\ninvolving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models,\nwhere for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each\nsolution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs\ntypically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and\nMATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language\nmodels) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the\nPRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has\ndemonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model\nGPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini.

However, differences in training\nconfigurations and data processing across model families lead to significant\nvariations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling\nlaw to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific\nscaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family.

These latent skills are influenced by computational\nresources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies\nacross model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide\nmore accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train\nmultiple LLMs per family.

Despite their remarkable\nperformance, LLMs face a critical challenge: the propensity to produce\nunreliable outputs due to the inherent limitations of their learning-based\nnature. Formal methods (FMs), on the other hand, are a well-established\ncomputation paradigm that provides mathematically rigorous techniques for\nmodeling, specifying, and verifying the correctness of systems. FMs have been\nextensively applied in mission-critical software engineering, embedded systems,\nand cybersecurity. However, the primary challenge impeding the deployment of\nFMs in real-world settings lies in their steep learning curves, the absence of\nuser-friendly interfaces, and issues with efficiency and adaptability.\n  This position paper outlines a roadmap for advancing the next generation of\ntrustworthy AI systems by leveraging the mutual enhancement of LLMs and FMs.\nFirst, we illustrate how FMs, including reasoning and certification techniques,\ncan help LLMs generate more reliable and formally certified outputs.\nSubsequently, we highlight how the advanced learning capabilities and\nadaptability of LLMs can significantly enhance the usability, efficiency, and\nscalability of existing FM tools. Finally, we show that unifying these two\ncomputation paradigms -- integrating the flexibility and intelligence of LLMs\nwith the rigorous reasoning abilities of FMs -- has transformative potential\nfor the development of trustworthy AI software systems. We acknowledge that\nthis integration has the potential to enhance both the trustworthiness and\nefficiency of software engineering practices while fostering the development of\nintelligent FM tools capable of addressing complex yet real-world challenges.",

      "abstract": "Anomaly synthesis is a crucial approach to augment abnormal data for\nadvancing anomaly inspection. Based on the knowledge from the large-scale\npre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly\nfocus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the\nentire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient\ndescriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies\n(e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and\ngeneralization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel\nanomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic\nfeatures as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues\nfrom text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized\nabnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and\nnon-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted\ntext prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to\nextract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors.\nThen, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to\nallow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus\nenhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly\nfeatures. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic\nGuided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the\nadequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate\nthat AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis\ncompared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for\ndownstream tasks.",

This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL)\nmethodology for future RUL forecasting.

These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted\nwind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise\nforecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least\naccurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by\nonly a few hours.

Model-based reinforcement\nlearning improves sample efficiency by generating simulated experiences using a\nlearned dynamic model of the environment.

This approach guides policy improvement by balancing\nexperiences similar to those frequently encountered with ones that have a\ndistribution mismatch.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a two-stage method that separates predictions under normal\nconditions and the causal effects of incidents. First, a normal prediction\nmodel is trained using data from normal situations. Next, the synthetic control\nmethod is employed to identify the causal effects of incidents, combined with\nplacebo tests to determine significant levels of these effects. The significant\neffects are then utilized to train a causal effect prediction model, which can\nforecast the impact of incidents based on features of the incidents and\npassenger flows. During the prediction phase, the results from both the normal\nsituation model and the causal effect prediction model are integrated to\ngenerate final passenger flow predictions during incidents. Our approach is\nvalidated using real-world data, demonstrating improved accuracy. Furthermore,\nthe two-stage methodology enhances interpretability. By analyzing the causal\neffect prediction model, we can identify key influencing factors related to the\neffects of incidents and gain insights into their underlying mechanisms.

      "abstract": "While large language models, such as GPT and BERT, have already demonstrated\nunprecedented skills in everything from natural language processing to\ndomain-specific applications, there came an unexplored phenomenon we term the\nRosetta Paradox. The Rosetta Paradox characterizes the counterintuitive\nperformance inversions across domains of knowledge. This paradox captures how\nsuch LLMs can excel in highly specialized fields but do poorly on tasks which\nrequire general, everyday knowledge. This paper formalizes the definition of\nthe Rosetta Paradox and introduces a panoramic analysis framework that includes\nboth a Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and a Performance Inversion Metric (PIM)\nfor consistent quantification of domain-specific behavior in LLMs.\n  We adopt this paradox and conduct a series of investigations through\nextensive experiments across diverse models and knowledge domains, ranging from\nrich technical areas to common-sense reasoning. Our findings indicate that the\nRosetta Paradox is likely not a mere artifact of data distribution but an\nintrinsic architectural and emergent property of deep neural networks. We\npresent comparative analyses across different model architectures, sizes, and\ntraining methodologies that shed light into the peculiar ways this paradox\nmanifests itself and challenge the standard evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious language tasks, but their widespread deployment is impeded by their\nlarge size and high computational costs. Structural pruning is a prevailing\ntechnique used to introduce sparsity into pre-trained models and facilitate\ndirect hardware acceleration during inference by removing redundant connections\n(structurally-grouped parameters), such as channels and attention heads.\nExisting structural pruning approaches often employ either global or layer-wise\npruning criteria; however, they are hindered by ineffectiveness stemming from\ninaccurate evaluation of connection importance. Global pruning methods\ntypically assess component importance using near-zero and unreliable gradients,\nwhile layer-wise pruning approaches encounter significant pruning error\naccumulation issues. To this end, we propose a more accurate pruning metric\nbased on the block-wise importance score propagation, termed LLM-BIP.\nSpecifically, LLM-BIP precisely evaluates connection importance by gauging its\ninfluence on the respective transformer block output, which can be efficiently\napproximated in a single forward pass through an upper bound derived from the\nassumption of Lipschitz continuity. We evaluate the proposed method using\nLLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B across common zero-shot tasks. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves an average of 3.26% increase in accuracy\nfor common reasoning tasks compared to previous best baselines. It also reduces\nperplexity by 14.09 and 68.76 on average for the WikiText2 dataset and PTB\ndataset, respectively.",

We show that BatchTopK\nSAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2\nSmall and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art\nJumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of\nlatents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a\ncostly hyperparameter sweep.

Our work aims to measure the propensity of\nOpenAI's LLMs to exhibit verbatim memorization in its outputs relative to other\nLLMs, specifically focusing on news articles.

We find\nthat as models increase in size, especially beyond 100 billion parameters, they\ndemonstrate significantly greater capacity for memorization. Our findings have\npractical implications for training: more attention must be placed on\npreventing verbatim memorization in very large models. Our findings also have\nlegal significance: in assessing the relative memorization capacity of OpenAI's\nLLMs, we probe the strength of The New York Times's copyright infringement\nclaims and OpenAI's legal defenses, while underscoring issues at the\nintersection of generative AI, law, and policy.",

A key challenge is effectively leveraging\ncompression errors and defining the boundaries for lossless compression to\nminimize model loss. i.e., compression for better. Currently, there is no\nsystematic approach to determining this error boundary or understanding its\nspecific impact on model performance. We propose a general\n\\textbf{L}oss\\textbf{L}ess \\textbf{C}ompression theoretical framework\n(\\textbf{LLC}), which further delineates the compression neighborhood and\nhigher-order analysis boundaries through the total differential, thereby\nspecifying the error range within which a model can be compressed without loss.\nTo verify the effectiveness of LLC, we apply various compression techniques,\nincluding quantization and decomposition. Specifically, for quantization, we\nreformulate the classic quantization search problem as a grouped knapsack\nproblem within the lossless neighborhood, achieving lossless quantization while\nimproving computational efficiency. For decomposition, LLC addresses the\napproximation problem under low-rank constraints, automatically determining the\nrank for each layer and producing lossless low-rank models.

We address this issue by introducing a novel joint\noptimization strategy for lossless low-rank weight factorization, which, for\nthe first time, enhances the model's performance beyond the original. Our\napproach begins with a theoretical analysis of the relationship between\nlow-rank factorization and model optimization objectives, establishing a\nprecise perturbation range for matrix factorization errors on model\nperformance. This challenge is then reformulated as a numerical rank deficiency\nproblem with inequality constraints and develop a joint objective that\nsimultaneously addresses factorization error and model performance. Based on\nthe above analysis, we propose two optimization algorithms: \\textbf{a lossless\noptimization algorithm} that maximizes model accuracy while ensuring\ncompression, and \\textbf{a compact optimization algorithm} that minimizes model\nsize while preserving performance. These algorithms do not require fine-tuning\nand can directly compress numerous deep models to achieve lossless results.

Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL\nalgorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and\nalgorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various\nnumber of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies\nwith high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data.

      "abstract": "Real-world recommendation systems commonly offer diverse content scenarios\nfor users to interact with. Considering the enormous number of users in\nindustrial platforms, it is infeasible to utilize a single unified\nrecommendation model to meet the requirements of all scenarios. Usually,\nseparate recommendation pipelines are established for each distinct scenario.\nThis practice leads to challenges in comprehensively grasping users' interests.\nRecent research endeavors have been made to tackle this problem by pre-training\nmodels to encapsulate the overall interests of users. Traditional pre-trained\nrecommendation models mainly capture user interests by leveraging collaborative\nsignals. Nevertheless, a prevalent drawback of these systems is their\nincapacity to handle long-tail items and cold-start scenarios. With the recent\nadvent of large language models, there has been a significant increase in\nresearch efforts focused on exploiting LLMs to extract semantic information for\nusers and items. However, text-based recommendations highly rely on elaborate\nfeature engineering and frequently fail to capture collaborative similarities.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training framework for\nsequential recommendation, termed PRECISE. This framework combines\ncollaborative signals with semantic information. Moreover, PRECISE employs a\nlearning framework that initially models users' comprehensive interests across\nall recommendation scenarios and subsequently concentrates on the specific\ninterests of target-scene behaviors. We demonstrate that PRECISE precisely\ncaptures the entire range of user interests and effectively transfers them to\nthe target interests. Empirical findings reveal that the PRECISE framework\nattains outstanding performance on both public and industrial datasets.",

Existing lightweight U-like networks have\nalleviated some of these problems, but they often have pre-designed structures\nand consist of inseparable modules, limiting their application scenarios. In\nthis paper, we propose three plug-and-play decoders by employing different\ndiscretization methods of the neural memory Ordinary Differential Equations\n(nmODEs).

In summary, the proposed\ndiscretized nmODEs decoders are capable of reducing the number of parameters by\nabout 20% ~ 50% and FLOPs by up to 74%, while possessing the potential to adapt\nto all U-like networks.

      "abstract": "Crack detection is a critical task in structural health monitoring, aimed at\nassessing the structural integrity of bridges, buildings, and roads to prevent\npotential failures. Vision-based crack detection has become the mainstream\napproach due to its ease of implementation and effectiveness. Fusing infrared\n(IR) channels with red, green and blue (RGB) channels can enhance feature\nrepresentation and thus improve crack detection. However, IR and RGB channels\noften differ in resolution. To align them, higher-resolution RGB images\ntypically need to be downsampled to match the IR image resolution, which leads\nto the loss of fine details. Moreover, crack detection performance is\nrestricted by the limited receptive fields and high computational complexity of\ntraditional image segmentation networks. Inspired by the recently proposed\nMamba neural architecture, this study introduces a two-stage paradigm called\nMSCrackMamba, which leverages Vision Mamba along with a super-resolution\nnetwork to address these challenges. Specifically, to align IR and RGB\nchannels, we first apply super-resolution to IR channels to match the\nresolution of RGB channels for data fusion. Vision Mamba is then adopted as the\nbackbone network, while UperNet is employed as the decoder for crack detection.\nOur approach is validated on the large-scale Crack Detection dataset Crack900,\ndemonstrating an improvement of 3.55% in mIoU compared to the best-performing\nbaseline methods.",

From the perspective of DSP, the following are two overlooked issues.\nOn the one hand, the number of ad creatives cannot grow indefinitely. On the\nother hand, the marginal effects of ad cost diminish as the number of ad\ncreatives increases. To this end, this paper proposes a two-stage framework\nnamed Automated Creatives Quota (ACQ) to achieve the automatic creation and\ndeactivation of ad creatives. ACQ dynamically allocates the creative quota\nacross multiple advertisers to maximize the revenue of the ad platform. ACQ\ncomprises two components: a prediction module to estimate the cost of a photo\nunder different numbers of ad creatives, and an allocation module to decide the\nquota for photos considering their estimated costs in the prediction module.\nSpecifically, in the prediction module, we develop a multi-task learning model\nbased on an unbalanced binary tree to effectively mitigate the target variable\nimbalance problem. In the allocation module, we formulate the quota allocation\nproblem as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) and develop an efficient\nsolver to solve such large-scale problems involving tens of millions of ads. We\nperformed extensive offline and online experiments to validate the superiority\nof our proposed framework, which increased cost by 9.34%.",

Prior work developed UCB-style algorithms in the\nmulti-armed [Wu et al., 2016] and contextual linear [Kazerouni et al., 2017]\nsettings.

In this paper, we consider CCBs beyond the linear case and develop\ntwo algorithms $\\mathtt{C-SquareCB}$ and $\\mathtt{C-FastCB}$, using Inverse Gap\nWeighting (IGW) based exploration and an online regression oracle. We show that\nthe safety constraint is satisfied with high probability and that the regret of\n$\\mathtt{C-SquareCB}$ is sub-linear in horizon $T$, while the regret of\n$\\mathtt{C-FastCB}$ is first-order and is sub-linear in $L^*$, the cumulative\nloss of the optimal policy. Subsequently, we use a neural network for function\napproximation and online gradient descent as the regression oracle to provide\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{KT} + K/\\alpha) $ and $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{KL^*} + K (1 +\n1/\\alpha))$ regret bounds, respectively.

Recent\nwork has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by\nsearching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In\nthis paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that\nleverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic\nwithin a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose\npromising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an\nentire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt\nbased on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable\nbaselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer\ninteractions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly\nadapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a\nheuristic. We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL\nplanning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on\nquery-efficient planning algorithms.

Due to competing objectives, the space of trade-offs\nis also expansive -- thus, examining the full Pareto frontier may prove\noverwhelming to a DM. Such real-world settings generally have loosely-defined\nand context-specific desirable regions for each objective function that can aid\nin constraining the search over the Pareto frontier.

Existing methods face\nchallenges in maintaining an effective balance between erasure efficacy and\nprior preservation, and they can be computationally costly. To improve, we\npropose a precise, fast, and low-cost concept erasure method, called Adaptive\nValue Decomposer (AdaVD), which is training-free. Our method is grounded in a\nclassical linear algebraic operation of computing the orthogonal complement,\nimplemented in the value space of each cross-attention layer within the UNet of\ndiffusion models. We design a shift factor to adaptively navigate the erasure\nstrength, enhancing effective prior preservation without sacrificing erasure\nefficacy. Extensive comparative experiments with both training-based and\ntraining-free state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed AdaVD\nexcels in both single and multiple concept erasure, showing 2 to 10 times\nimprovement in prior preservation than the second best, meanwhile achieving the\nbest or near best erasure efficacy. AdaVD supports a series of diffusion models\nand downstream image generation tasks, with code available on:\nhttps://github.com/WYuan1001/AdaVD.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their\napplication in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter\nfactuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize\ntextual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict\ninformation in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment\nin Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated\nclinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily\ndistinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference\noptimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference\nsamples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference\ndata by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations\ninjected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate\nresponses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising,\ndisrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical\nrelevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual\ntools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as\nweights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO\nsignificantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial\nimprovements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2%\nand 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks.

      "abstract": "In the domain of architectural design, the foundational essence of creativity\nand human intelligence lies in the mastery of solving floorplans, a skill\ndemanding distinctive expertise and years of experience. Traditionally, the\narchitectural design process of creating floorplans often requires substantial\nmanual labour and architectural expertise. Even when relying on parametric\ndesign approaches, the process is limited based on the designer's ability to\nbuild a complex set of parameters to iteratively explore design alternatives.\nAs a result, these approaches hinder creativity and limit discovery of an\noptimal solution. Here, we present a generative latent diffusion model that\nlearns to generate floorplans for various building types based on building\nfootprints and design briefs. The introduced model learns from the complexity\nof the inter-connections between diverse building types and the mutations of\narchitectural designs. By harnessing the power of latent diffusion models, this\nresearch surpasses conventional limitations in the design process. The model's\nability to learn from diverse building types means that it cannot only\nreplicate existing designs but also produce entirely new configurations that\nfuse design elements in unexpected ways. This innovation introduces a new\ndimension of creativity into architectural design, allowing architects, urban\nplanners and even individuals without specialised expertise to explore\nuncharted territories of form and function with speed and cost-effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Neck ultrasound (US) plays a vital role in airway management by providing\nnon-invasive, real-time imaging that enables rapid and precise interventions.\nDeep learning-based anatomical landmark detection in neck US can further\nfacilitate procedural efficiency. However, class imbalance within datasets,\nwhere key structures like tracheal rings and vocal folds are underrepresented,\npresents significant challenges for object detection models. To address this,\nwe propose T2ID-CAS, a hybrid approach that combines a text-to-image latent\ndiffusion model with class-aware sampling to generate high-quality synthetic\nsamples for underrepresented classes. This approach, rarely explored in the\nultrasound domain, improves the representation of minority classes.\nExperimental results using YOLOv9 for anatomical landmark detection in neck US\ndemonstrated that T2ID-CAS achieved a mean Average Precision of 88.2,\nsignificantly surpassing the baseline of 66. This highlights its potential as a\ncomputationally efficient and scalable solution for mitigating class imbalance\nin AI-assisted ultrasound-guided interventions.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are identified as being susceptible to indirect\nprompt injection attack, where the model undesirably deviates from\nuser-provided instructions by executing tasks injected in the prompt context.\nThis vulnerability stems from LLMs' inability to distinguish between data and\ninstructions within a prompt. In this paper, we propose CachePrune that defends\nagainst this attack by identifying and pruning task-triggering neurons from the\nKV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the\nLLM to treat the text spans of input prompt context as only pure data, instead\nof any indicator of instruction following. These neurons are identified via\nfeature attribution with a loss function induced from an upperbound of the\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) objective. We show that such a loss\nfunction enables effective feature attribution with only a few samples. We\nfurther improve on the quality of feature attribution, by exploiting an\nobserved triggering effect in instruction following. Our approach does not\nimpose any formatting on the original prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM\ncalls. Experiments show that CachePrune significantly reduces attack success\nrates without compromising the response quality. Note: This paper aims to\ndefend against indirect prompt injection attacks, with the goal of developing\nmore secure and robust AI systems.",

Belief states are defined as dynamic ensembles of linguistic expressions\nembedded within a navigable manifold, where operators enable assimilation,\nabstraction, nullification, memory, and introspection. Drawing from philosophy,\ncognitive science, and neuroscience, we develop a layered framework that\nenables self-regulating epistemic agents capable of reflective, goal-directed\nthought. At the core of this framework is the epistemic vacuum: a class of\nsemantically inert cognitive states that serves as the conceptual origin of\nbelief space. From this foundation, the Null Tower arises as a generative\nstructure recursively built through internal representational capacities. The\ntheoretical constructs are designed to be implementable in both symbolic and\nneural systems, including large language models, hybrid agents, and adaptive\nmemory architectures.

We collected a new silent speech dataset of over\n120 hours of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 12 subjects, capturing\n24 commonly used English words for language model pretraining and decoding.\nFollowing the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised\nparadigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain\nLanguage Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To\npretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining\nparadigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data. Unlike\nexisting EEG pretraining methods that mainly follow a masked-reconstruction\nparadigm, our proposed FSTP method employs autoregressive modeling in temporal\nand frequency domains to capture both temporal and spectral dependencies from\nEEG signals. After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks,\nincluding word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and\npretrained baseline models. For instance, in the difficult cross-session\nsetting, our model achieves 47.0\\% accuracy on semantic-level classification\nand 39.6\\% in word-level classification, outperforming baseline methods by\n5.4\\% and 7.3\\%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Wildlife trafficking remains a critical global issue, significantly impacting\nbiodiversity, ecological stability, and public health. Despite efforts to\ncombat this illicit trade, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier\nto sell wildlife products, putting new pressure on wild populations of\nendangered and threatened species. The use of these platforms also opens a new\nopportunity: as criminals sell wildlife products online, they leave digital\ntraces of their activity that can provide insights into trafficking activities\nas well as how they can be disrupted. The challenge lies in finding these\ntraces. Online marketplaces publish ads for a plethora of products, and\nidentifying ads for wildlife-related products is like finding a needle in a\nhaystack. Learning classifiers can automate ad identification, but creating\nthem requires costly, time-consuming data labeling that hinders support for\ndiverse ads and research questions. This paper addresses a critical challenge\nin the data science pipeline for wildlife trafficking analytics: generating\nquality labeled data for classifiers that select relevant data. While large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can directly label advertisements, doing so at scale is\nprohibitively expensive. We propose a cost-effective strategy that leverages\nLLMs to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of the data and uses these\nlabels to create specialized classification models. Our novel method\nautomatically gathers diverse and representative samples to be labeled while\nminimizing the labeling costs. Our experimental evaluation shows that our\nclassifiers achieve up to 95% F1 score, outperforming LLMs at a lower cost. We\npresent real use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in\nenabling analyses of different aspects of wildlife trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Federated Graph Learning (FGL) empowers clients to collaboratively train\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner while preserving data\nprivacy. However, FGL methods usually require that the graph data owned by all\nclients is homophilic to ensure similar neighbor distribution patterns of\nnodes. Such an assumption ensures that the learned knowledge is consistent\nacross the local models from all clients. Therefore, these local models can be\nproperly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall\nperformance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes\nvary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different\nlevels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict\nknowledge from their node-level predictive tasks. Consequently, aggregating\nthese local models usually leads to catastrophic performance deterioration on\nthe global model. To address this challenge, we propose FedHERO, an FGL\nframework designed to harness and share insights from heterophilic graphs\neffectively. At the heart of FedHERO is a dual-channel GNN equipped with a\nstructure learner, engineered to discern the structural knowledge encoded in\nthe local graphs. With this specialized component, FedHERO enables the local\nmodel for each client to identify and learn patterns that are universally\napplicable across graphs with different patterns of node neighbor\ndistributions. FedHERO not only enhances the performance of individual client\nmodels by leveraging both local and shared structural insights but also sets a\nnew precedent in this field to effectively handle graph data with various node\nneighbor distribution patterns. We conduct extensive experiments to validate\nthe superior performance of FedHERO against existing alternatives.",

Traditional numerical\nweather prediction (NWP) models struggle with extreme heat for medium-range and\nsubseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales.

This study investigates 2-m\ntemperature forecasts for 60 heat waves across the four boreal seasons and over\nfour CONUS regions at lead times up to 20 days, using two AIWP models (Google\nGraphCast and Pangu-Weather) and one traditional NWP model (NOAA United\nForecast System Global Ensemble Forecast System (UFS GEFS)). First, case study\nanalyses show that both AIWP models and the UFS GEFS exhibit consistent cold\nbiases on regional scales in the 5-10 days of lead time before heat wave onset.\nGraphCast is the more skillful AIWP model, outperforming UFS GEFS and\nPangu-Weather in most locations. Next, the two AIWP models are isolated and\nanalyzed across all heat waves and seasons, with events split among the model's\ntesting (2018-2023) and training (1979-2017) periods. There are cold biases\nbefore and during the heat waves in both models and all seasons, except\nPangu-Weather in winter, which exhibits a mean warm bias before heat wave\nonset. Overall, results offer encouragement that AIWP models may be useful for\nmedium-range and S2S predictability of extreme heat.",

Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both\nzero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning\nsignificantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their\nzero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was\nconsistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally\nperformed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder\ntasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks\nbut significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results\nhighlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains,\nenabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification\ntasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further\nadvantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is marked by significant inter-individual\nvariability in its progression, complicating accurate prognosis and\npersonalized care planning. This heterogeneity underscores the critical need\nfor predictive models capable of forecasting patient-specific disease\ntrajectories. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to address\nthis challenge by analyzing complex, multi-modal, and longitudinal patient\ndata. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI methodologies applied to\npersonalized AD progression prediction. We review key approaches including\nstate-space models for capturing temporal dynamics, deep learning techniques\nlike Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modeling, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) for leveraging network structures, and the emerging concept of AI-driven\ndigital twins for individualized simulation. Recognizing that data limitations\noften impede progress, we examine common challenges such as high\ndimensionality, missing data, and dataset imbalance. We further discuss\nAI-driven mitigation strategies, with a specific focus on synthetic data\ngeneration using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) to augment and balance datasets. The survey synthesizes the\nstrengths and limitations of current approaches, emphasizing the trend towards\nmultimodal integration and the persistent need for model interpretability and\ngeneralizability. Finally, we identify critical open challenges, including\nrobust external validation, clinical integration, and ethical considerations,\nand outline promising future research directions such as hybrid models, causal\ninference, and federated learning. This review aims to consolidate current\nknowledge and guide future efforts in developing clinically relevant AI tools\nfor personalized AD prognostication.",

    "abstract": "Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is\nskewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural\nnetworks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on\nunderrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem,\nonly a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the\navailable solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class\nimbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian\nnoise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the\nunderlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently,\nthese approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent\nthe true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nSMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage\n1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target\nregions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves\nas SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss\naugmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the\ntrue joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced\ndatasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling\nmethod without the DistGAN filtering layer.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be valuable tools for tackling\nprocess mining tasks. Existing studies report on their capability to support\nvarious data-driven process analyses and even, to some extent, that they are\nable to reason about how processes work. This reasoning ability suggests that\nthere is potential for LLMs to tackle semantics-aware process mining tasks,\nwhich are tasks that rely on an understanding of the meaning of activities and\ntheir relationships. Examples of these include process discovery, where the\nmeaning of activities can indicate their dependency, whereas in anomaly\ndetection the meaning can be used to recognize process behavior that is\nabnormal. In this paper, we systematically explore the capabilities of LLMs for\nsuch tasks. Unlike prior work, which largely evaluates LLMs in their default\nstate, we investigate their utility through both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define five process mining tasks\nrequiring semantic understanding and provide extensive benchmarking datasets\nfor evaluation. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with\nchallenging process mining tasks when used out of the box or with minimal\nin-context examples, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these\ntasks across a broad range of process types and industries.",

The key challenge is handling\nuncertain constraints -- those whose satisfaction cannot be deterministically\nevaluated~(e.g., whether a chatbot response is ``harmful''). We address this\nthrough three innovations: (1) a safety classification model that assesses\nconstraint satisfaction probability, (2) internal test data to evaluate this\nclassifier's reliability, and (3) conservative testing to prevent overfitting\nwhen this data is used in training. We prove our method guarantees\nprobabilistic safety under mild conditions and establish the first scaling law\nin AI safety -- showing that the safety-performance trade-off improves\npredictably with more internal test data. Experiments across production\nplanning, reinforcement learning, and language generation demonstrate our\nframework achieves up to 140 times better safety than existing methods at the\nsame performance levels.

A retrieval model collects images for those\ncaptions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the\ngiven biases.

    "abstract": "The expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised\ngrowing concerns about their potential to generate undesirable or harmful\ncontent, ranging from fabricated depictions of public figures to sexually\nexplicit images. To mitigate these risks, prior work has devised machine\nunlearning techniques that attempt to erase unwanted concepts through\nfine-tuning. However, in this paper, we introduce a new threat model, Toxic\nErasure (ToxE), and demonstrate how recent unlearning algorithms, including\nthose explicitly designed for robustness, can be circumvented through targeted\nbackdoor attacks. The threat is realized by establishing a link between a\ntrigger and the undesired content. Subsequent unlearning attempts fail to erase\nthis link, allowing adversaries to produce harmful content. We instantiate ToxE\nvia two established backdoor attacks: one targeting the text encoder and\nanother manipulating the cross-attention layers. Further, we introduce Deep\nIntervention Score-based Attack (DISA), a novel, deeper backdoor attack that\noptimizes the entire U-Net using a score-based objective, improving the\nattack's persistence across different erasure methods. We evaluate five recent\nconcept erasure methods against our threat model. For celebrity identity\nerasure, our deep attack circumvents erasure with up to 82% success, averaging\n57% across all erasure methods. For explicit content erasure, ToxE attacks can\nelicit up to 9 times more exposed body parts, with DISA yielding an average\nincrease by a factor of 2.9. These results highlight a critical security gap in\ncurrent unlearning strategies.",

    "abstract": "Blockbuster is a framework for AI operator fusion in inference programs. The\nBlockbuster framework is compatible with any multiprocessor architecture that\nhas a tiered memory hierarchy, including GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and some AI\naccelerator chips. It includes a graph-based representation for AI workloads,\ncalled a block program, which explicitly models how blocks of data move between\nthe memory tiers. It also includes an operator fusion procedure, which is made\nup of a candidate selection algorithm and a fusion algorithm that fuses each\nindividual candidate - this two-algorithm structure makes Blockbuster\nespecially suitable for large AI programs. The current paper focuses on the\nfusion algorithm, which is a rule-based technique. While the literature is full\nof previous rule-based fusion algorithms, what sets our algorithm apart is its\ndirect modeling of data movement between memory tiers, resulting in uniquely\npowerful fusion results. As a first sanity check, we demonstrate how our\nalgorithm automatically rediscovers the well-known Flash Attention kernel.\nThen, we demonstrate the real power of our approach by fusing LayerNorm with\nmatrix multiplication and RMSNorm with FNN-SwiGLU - the latter involves fusing\nthree matrix multiplications, a Hadamard product, a reduction, and a few\nelementwise operations into a single mega-kernel.",

    "abstract": "Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field.\nAs benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more\nsusceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard\nfor ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify\nsystematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that\nundisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are\nable to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if\ndesired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best\nscore leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance\nresults. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in\nthe lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed\nmodels are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models\nremoved from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both\nthese policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like\nGoogle and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the\narena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only\nreceived an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot\nArena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result\nin relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on\nour conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to\nArena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on\nthe substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that\nmaintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable\nrecommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote\nfairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field",

Given a recommendation prompt, operating layer\nby layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source\nlanguage model by integrating knowledge from all other models. These refined\nrepresentations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the\nactivations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are\npreserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for\nsequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to a model\nthat is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional\nparameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools,\nElectronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring\nabout 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective.\nFurthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over\nalternative cross-domain baselines. Overall, X-Cross enables scalable and\nadaptive cross-domain recommendations, reducing computational overhead and\nproviding an efficient solution for data-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in\naddressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks. However, recent\nstudies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial\nattacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real\nworld, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks\nand enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of\nthese defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural\nbias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail\nnodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes\nwith low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\ndefense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN\naugmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to\nmitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the\nhetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e.,\nlinks connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic\nlinks (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low\ndegree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is\nadopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of\ngraph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and\ndebiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets.",

The Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) offers a promising approach, as it provides an interactive interface\nbased on visual prompting and edition to refine an initial segmentation. This\nmodel has strong generalization capabilities, does not rely on predefined\nclasses, and adapts to diverse objects; however, it is pre-trained on natural\nimages and lacks the ability to process medical data effectively. In addition,\nthis model is built for 2D images, whereas a whole medical domain is based on\n3D images, such as CT and MRI.

In practice, we\ntrain a 2D model using noisy masks as initial prompts, in addition to bounding\nboxes and points. We then use this novel prompt type with an iterative\ninference pipeline to reconstruct the 3D mask slice-by-slice.

    "abstract": "As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a breakthrough in scene\nrepresentation and novel view synthesis, its rapid adoption in safety-critical\ndomains (e.g., autonomous systems, AR/VR) urgently demands scrutiny of\npotential security vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first systematic\nstudy of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may\nimplant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference,\npotentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or\nspatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose\nGuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap\ninjects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving\nhigh-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and\nmaximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a\nthree-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant\nstealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing\nattack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D\nrendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful\nbackdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views,\nvalidating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for\nmore efficient serving strategies. In this context, efficiency refers to the\nproportion of requests that meet their Service Level Objectives (SLOs),\nparticularly for Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT).\nHowever, existing systems often prioritize one metric at the cost of the other.\nWe present Ascendra, an LLM serving system designed to meet both TTFT and TBT\nSLOs simultaneously. The core insight behind Ascendra is that a request's\nurgency evolves as it approaches its deadline. To leverage this, Ascendra\npartitions GPU resources into two types of instances: low-priority and\nhigh-priority. Low-priority instances maximize throughput by processing\nrequests out of arrival order, but at the risk of request starvation. To\naddress this, Ascendra employs a performance model to predict requests at risk\nof missing their SLOs and proactively offloads them to high-priority instances.\nHigh-priority instances are optimized for low-latency execution and handle\nurgent requests nearing their deadlines. This partitioned architecture enables\nAscendra to effectively balance high throughput and low latency. Extensive\nevaluation shows that Ascendra improves system throughput by up to 1.7x\ncompared to vLLM and Sarathi-Serve while meeting both TTFT and TBT SLOs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple\ncommunication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has\nsignificant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer\ninteraction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes\nclearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony,\nthis study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and\ntemporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities.\nUsing dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous\nemotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech\naudio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional\nalignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was\nassociated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than\noverlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically\ndifferent, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for\narousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer,\nmore consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping\nspeech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW\nindicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination\nstrategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions\nmore often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during\nsimultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of\nconversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new\ninsight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective\nalignment in real world interaction.",

The graph transformer, with\nits advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional\ngraph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of\ngraph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to\neffectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage\nonly sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of\nmolecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based\nframework for molecular generation, which we call \\textbf{JTreeformer} as it\ntransforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN\nparallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed\nacyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can\niteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the\npartially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a\ndiffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to\nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical\nresults demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule\ngeneration methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery\n(https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel graph-based framework for robust and\ninterpretable multiclass fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The method\nintegrates entropy-optimized signal segmentation, time-frequency feature\nextraction, and graph-theoretic modeling to transform vibration signals into\nstructured representations suitable for classification. Graph metrics, such as\naverage shortest path length, modularity, and spectral gap, are computed and\ncombined with local features to capture global and segment-level fault\ncharacteristics. The proposed method achieves high diagnostic accuracy when\nevaluated on two benchmark datasets, the CWRU bearing dataset (under 0-3 HP\nloads) and the SU gearbox and bearing datasets (under different speed-load\nconfigurations). Classification scores reach up to 99.8% accuracy on Case\nWestern Reserve University (CWRU) and 100% accuracy on the Southeast University\ndatasets using a logistic regression classifier. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits strong noise resilience, maintaining over 95.4% accuracy at high noise\nlevels (standard deviation = 0.5), and demonstrates excellent cross-domain\ntransferability with up to 99.7% F1-score in load-transfer scenarios. Compared\nto traditional techniques, this approach requires no deep learning\narchitecture, enabling lower complexity while ensuring interpretability. The\nresults confirm the method's scalability, reliability, and potential for\nreal-time deployment in industrial diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue\nto exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when\nreal-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated\nthat neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing\nonce they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily\nused small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend\ngrokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset\nsparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed\nsynthetic data to raise the ratio $\\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts\nabove the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even\nfactually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits\nrather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational\nstructure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning\nbenchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA -\nsubstantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current\nstate-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how\nincreasing $\\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside\nTransformers.

In this article, we aim to defend the value of post-hoc\nexplanations against this recent critique. We argue that even if post-hoc\nexplanations do not replicate the exact reasoning processes of black box\nsystems, they can still improve users' functional understanding of black box\nsystems, increase the accuracy of clinician-AI teams, and assist clinicians in\njustifying their AI-informed decisions.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in\nimproving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge\nrelevant to queries. However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a\ntext-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other\nmodalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single\nmodality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the\ntype of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot\naddress. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework\ndesigned to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with\ndiverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the\nobservation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space\nderived from a single aggregated corpus causes a modality gap, where the\nretrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose\na modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most\nappropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it.\nAlso, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity\nlevels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of\nthe query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple\nmodalities, showing its superiority over various modality-specific and unified\nbaselines.",

Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning\ntrace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its\nconclusion.

Can alternative reasoning paths yield different\nresults? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps,\ntermed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach\ninvolves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on\nlinguistic cues.

Recently, graph neural network (GNN)-based models have gained\nwidespread adoption due to their ability to capture brain channel functional\nconnectivity from both spatial and temporal perspectives. However, their\neffectiveness is hindered by the absence of a robust temporal biomarker. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel and effective biomarker for depression\ndiagnosis by leveraging the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose a\ncustomized graph network architecture based on Temporal Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (TGCN). Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 1,086 subjects,\nwhich is over 10 times larger than previous datasets in the field of depression\ndiagnosis. Furthermore, to align with medical requirements, we performed\npropensity score matching (PSM) to create a refined subset, referred to as the\nPSM dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating our newly\ndesigned biomarker enhances the representation of temporal characteristics in\nbrain channels, leading to improved F1 scores in both the real-world dataset\nand the PSM dataset. This advancement has the potential to contribute to the\ndevelopment of more effective depression diagnostic tools.

Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt\nvision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt.\nHowever, such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to\nperformance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of\nexperts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing\nMoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high\ncommunication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations,\nwe propose TRIP, a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing\nframework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike\nexisting image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an\nimage to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP\nincorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and\noptimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by\naggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each.\nAdditionally, TRIP develops an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts,\nleveraging the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments\nacross four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization\nresults, with communication of only 1K parameters per round.

Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from\nlimitations in speech intelligibility, audio-video synchronization, speech\nnaturalness, and voice similarity to the reference speaker. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AlignDiT, a multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer\nthat generates accurate, synchronized, and natural-sounding speech from aligned\nmultimodal inputs. Built upon the in-context learning capability of the DiT\narchitecture, AlignDiT explores three effective strategies to align multimodal\nrepresentations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal classifier-free\nguidance mechanism that allows the model to adaptively balance information from\neach modality during speech synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nAlignDiT significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks\nin terms of quality, synchronization, and speaker similarity. Moreover,\nAlignDiT exhibits strong generalization capability across various multimodal\ntasks, such as video-to-speech synthesis and visual forced alignment,\nconsistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.

This principle of\ncognitive mapping is universal to agents with limited resources. Living\norganisms, people, and algorithms all face the problem of forming functional\nrepresentations of their world under various computing constraints. In this\nwork, we explore the hypothesis that human resource-efficient planning may\narise from representing the world as predictably structured. Building on the\nmetaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the\nform of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in\ncontrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment\nto show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning\nstrategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a\ncomputational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured\nscenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic\ncognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this\ndistribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large\nLanguage Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through\ntraining on a vast corpus of human data. Our model demonstrates improved\ncomputational efficiency, requires drastically less memory, and outperforms\nunstructured planning algorithms with cognitive constraints at predicting human\nbehavior, suggesting that human planning strategies rely on programmatic\ncognitive maps.",

    "abstract": "Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality\nin wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data\nrates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment,\ncontrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on\nrecurrent neural networks (RNN), whose computational complexity hinders system\nefficiency.

Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW\n256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03\ndBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square\nError (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal\nsparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power.

By training on a mixture of our synthetic\ndata and existing public data, ReasonIR-8B achieves a new state-of-the-art of\n29.9 nDCG@10 without reranker and 36.9 nDCG@10 with reranker on BRIGHT, a\nwidely-used reasoning-intensive information retrieval (IR) benchmark. When\napplied to RAG tasks, ReasonIR-8B improves MMLU and GPQA performance by 6.4%\nand 22.6% respectively, relative to the closed-book baseline, outperforming\nother retrievers and search engines. In addition, ReasonIR-8B uses test-time\ncompute more effectively: on BRIGHT, its performance consistently increases\nwith longer and more information-rich rewritten queries; it continues to\noutperform other retrievers when combined with an LLM reranker.

    "abstract": "We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training\nexample (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model\nQwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance\non MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six\ncommon mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result\nmatches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500:\n73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar\nsubstantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B,\nLlama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and\nPPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or\ngreater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In\naddition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including\ncross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and\nsustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has\nsaturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we\nverify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy\ngradient loss, distinguishing it from the \"grokking\" phenomenon. We also show\nthe critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with\nan appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe\nthat applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly\nenhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings\ncan inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination\nof both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR.

    "abstract": "Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new\nclasses (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while\nconcurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called\nstability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance\nbetween the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated\nmodel. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through\nexperience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address\nbias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a\nwell-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity\nor limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge\nin the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method,\ncalled Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high\nplasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our\nBOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual\nclassifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be\nintegrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for\ntransferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental\nevaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.",

We develop a systematic approach to\nefficiently collect attack prompts and an adaptive token compression framework\nthat utilizes LLMs to automatically compress these prompts.

Specifically, for image reconstruction tasks, the proposed\nABG formula can well fit the commonly used DL networks, such as SCUNet, and\nVision Transformer, for semantic encoding with the multi scale-structural\nsimilarity index measure (MS-SSIM) measurement.

    "abstract": "Personalized news recommendation systems often struggle to effectively\ncapture the complexity of user preferences, as they rely heavily on shallow\nrepresentations, such as article titles and abstracts. To address this problem,\nwe introduce a novel method, namely PNR-LLM, for Large Language Models for\nPersonalized News Recommendation. Specifically, PNR-LLM harnesses the\ngeneration capabilities of LLMs to enrich news titles and abstracts, and\nconsequently improves recommendation quality. PNR-LLM contains a novel module,\nNews Enrichment via LLMs, which generates deeper semantic information and\nrelevant entities from articles, transforming shallow contents into richer\nrepresentations. We further propose an attention mechanism to aggregate\nenriched semantic- and entity-level data, forming unified user and news\nembeddings that reveal a more accurate user-news match. Extensive experiments\non MIND datasets show that PNR-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\nMoreover, the proposed data enrichment module is model-agnostic, and we\nempirically show that applying our proposed module to multiple existing models\ncan further improve their performance, verifying the advantage of our design.",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks, as\nbackdoored models would misclassify poisoned samples with specific triggers\ninto target classes while maintaining normal performance on clean samples.\nAmong these, multi-target backdoor attacks can simultaneously target multiple\nclasses. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks all follow the\ndirty-label paradigm, where poisoned samples are mislabeled, and most of them\nrequire an extremely high poisoning rate. This makes them easily detectable by\nmanual inspection. In contrast, clean-label attacks are more stealthy, as they\navoid modifying the labels of poisoned samples. However, they generally\nstruggle to achieve stable and satisfactory attack performance and often fail\nto scale effectively to multi-target attacks. To address this issue, we propose\nthe Feature-based Full-target Clean-label Backdoor Attacks (FFCBA) which\nconsists of two paradigms: Feature-Spanning Backdoor Attacks (FSBA) and\nFeature-Migrating Backdoor Attacks (FMBA). FSBA leverages class-conditional\nautoencoders to generate noise triggers that align perturbed in-class samples\nwith the original category's features, ensuring the effectiveness, intra-class\nconsistency, inter-class specificity and natural-feature correlation of\ntriggers. While FSBA supports swift and efficient attacks, its cross-model\nattack capability is relatively weak. FMBA employs a two-stage\nclass-conditional autoencoder training process that alternates between using\nout-of-class samples and in-class samples. This allows FMBA to generate\ntriggers with strong target-class features, making it highly effective for\ncross-model attacks. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models,\nthe results show that FFCBA achieves outstanding attack performance and\nmaintains desirable robustness against the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.",

However, due to\nlimitations in existing training methods and inherent model constraints, SNNs\noften exhibit a performance gap when compared to Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs). Knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored as a technique to\ntransfer knowledge from ANN teacher models to SNN student models to mitigate\nthis gap. Traditional KD methods typically use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nto align output distributions. However, conventional KL-based approaches fail\nto fully exploit the unique characteristics of SNNs, as they tend to\noveremphasize high-probability predictions while neglecting low-probability\nones, leading to suboptimal generalization. To address this, we propose\nHead-Tail Aware Kullback-Leibler (HTA-KL) divergence, a novel KD method for\nSNNs. HTA-KL introduces a cumulative probability-based mask to dynamically\ndistinguish between high- and low-probability regions. It assigns adaptive\nweights to ensure balanced knowledge transfer, enhancing the overall\nperformance.

This allows attackers to control the model to misclassify\npoisoned samples with triggers into any desired target class during inference,\nexhibiting superior attack performance compared with conventional backdoor\nattacks. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks fail to guarantee\ntrigger specificity and stealthiness in black-box settings, resulting in two\nmain issues. First, they are unable to simultaneously target all classes when\nonly training data can be manipulated, limiting their effectiveness in\nrealistic attack scenarios. Second, the triggers often lack visual\nimperceptibility, making poisoned samples easy to detect. To address these\nproblems, we propose a Spatial-based Full-target Invisible Backdoor Attack,\ncalled SFIBA. It restricts triggers for different classes to specific local\nspatial regions and morphologies in the pixel space to ensure specificity,\nwhile employing a frequency-domain-based trigger injection method to guarantee\nstealthiness. Specifically, for injection of each trigger, we first apply fast\nfourier transform to obtain the amplitude spectrum of clean samples in local\nspatial regions. Then, we employ discrete wavelet transform to extract the\nfeatures from the amplitude spectrum and use singular value decomposition to\nintegrate the trigger. Subsequently, we selectively filter parts of the trigger\nin pixel space to implement trigger morphology constraints and adjust injection\ncoefficients based on visual effects. We conduct experiments on multiple\ndatasets and models. The results demonstrate that SFIBA can achieve excellent\nattack performance and stealthiness, while preserving the model's performance\non benign samples, and can also bypass existing backdoor defenses.",

Diagnosing these lesions is challenging due to their subtle imaging\nfeatures, often leading to reliance on invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). This\nstudy introduces ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated\ndataset for shoulder pathologies, and presents a deep learning (DL) framework\nfor detecting Bankart lesions on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI includes\n586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from 558 patients who underwent\narthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived from intraoperative findings, the\ngold standard for diagnosis. Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were\ntrained using a combination of CNNs and transformers. Predictions from\nsagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance. The\nmodels were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71\nstandard MRIs). The models achieved an AUC of 0.91 and 0.93, sensitivity of 83%\nand 94%, and specificity of 91% and 86% for standard MRIs and MRAs,\nrespectively. Notably, model performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched\nor surpassed radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation demonstrated\ninitial generalizability across imaging protocols. This study demonstrates that\nDL models can achieve radiologist-level diagnostic performance on standard\nMRIs, reducing the need for invasive MRAs. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular\ncodebase for training and evaluating deep learning models on 3D medical imaging\ndata, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and support the\ndevelopment of new datasets for clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.",

    "abstract": "Diagnostic reasoning entails a physician's local (mental) model based on an\nassumed or known shared perspective (global model) to explain patient\nobservations with evidence assigned towards a clinical assessment. But in\nseveral (complex) medical situations, multiple experts work together as a team\nto optimize health evaluation and decision-making by leveraging different\nperspectives. Such consensus-driven reasoning reflects individual knowledge\ncontributing toward a broader perspective on the patient. In this light, we\nintroduce STRUCture-following for Multiagent Systems (STRUC-MAS), a framework\nautomating the learning of these global models and their incorporation as prior\nbeliefs for agents in multiagent systems (MAS) to follow. We demonstrate proof\nof concept with a prosocial MAS application for predicting acute kidney\ninjuries (AKIs). In this case, we found that incorporating a global structure\nenabled multiple agents to achieve better performance (average precision, AP)\nin predicting AKI 48 hours before onset (structure-following-fine-tuned, SF-FT,\nAP=0.195; SF-FT-retrieval-augmented generation, SF-FT-RAG, AP=0.194) vs.\nbaseline (non-structure-following-FT, NSF-FT, AP=0.141; NSF-FT-RAG, AP=0.180)\nfor balanced precision-weighted-recall-weighted voting. Markedly, SF-FT agents\nwith higher recall scores reported lower confidence levels in the initial round\non true positive and false negative cases. But after explicit interactions,\ntheir confidence in their decisions increased (suggesting reinforced belief).\nIn contrast, the SF-FT agent with the lowest recall decreased its confidence in\ntrue positive and false negative cases (suggesting a new belief). This approach\nsuggests that learning and leveraging global structures in MAS is necessary\nprior to achieving competitive classification and diagnostic reasoning\nperformance.",

In this work, we introduce Local Prompt\nOptimization (LPO) that integrates with any general automatic prompt\nengineering method. We identify the optimization tokens in a prompt and nudge\nthe LLM to focus only on those tokens in its optimization step.

    "abstract": "With AI-generated content becoming ubiquitous across the web, social media,\nand other digital platforms, it is vital to examine how such content are\ninspired and generated. The creation of AI-generated images often involves\nrefining the input prompt iteratively to achieve desired visual outcomes. This\nstudy focuses on the relatively underexplored concept of image regeneration\nusing AI, in which a human operator attempts to closely recreate a specific\ntarget image by iteratively refining their prompt. Image regeneration is\ndistinct from normal image generation, which lacks any predefined visual\nreference. A separate challenge lies in determining whether existing image\nsimilarity metrics (ISMs) can provide reliable, objective feedback in iterative\nworkflows, given that we do not fully understand if subjective human judgments\nof similarity align with these metrics. Consequently, we must first validate\ntheir alignment with human perception before assessing their potential as a\nfeedback mechanism in the iterative prompt refinement process. To address these\nresearch gaps, we present a structured user study evaluating how iterative\nprompt refinement affects the similarity of regenerated images relative to\ntheir targets, while also examining whether ISMs capture the same improvements\nperceived by human observers. Our findings suggest that incremental prompt\nadjustments substantially improve alignment, verified through both subjective\nevaluations and quantitative measures, underscoring the broader potential of\niterative workflows to enhance generative AI content creation across various\napplication domains.",

Focusing on language, we train a model that inherits a \"model\nconnectome\" from the outer evolution loop before exposing it to a\ndevelopmental-scale corpus of 100M tokens. Compared with two closely matched\ncontrol models, we show that the connectome model performs better or on par on\nnatural language processing tasks as well as alignment to human behavior and\nbrain data.

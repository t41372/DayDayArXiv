    "abstract": "There are concerns about the reliability and safety of artificial\nintelligence (AI) based on sub-symbolic neural networks because its decisions\ncannot be explained explicitly. This is the black box problem of modern AI. At\nthe same time, symbolic AI has the nature of a white box and is able to ensure\nthe reliability and safety of its decisions. However, several problems prevent\nthe widespread use of symbolic AI: the opacity of mathematical models and\nnatural language terms, the lack of a unified ontology, and the combinatorial\nexplosion of search capabilities. To solve the black-box problem of AI, we\npropose eXplicitly eXplainable AI (XXAI) - a fully transparent white-box AI\nbased on deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from\nthe first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain. In this\ncase, the general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for\nderiving the inferences of the cellular automata. A cellular automaton\nimplements parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization\n- from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole. Our\nverification of several ecological hypotheses sets a precedent for the\nsuccessful implementation of the proposed solution. XXAI is able to\nautomatically verify the reliability, security and ethics of sub-symbolic\nneural network solutions in both the final and training phases. In this\narticle, we present precedents for the successful implementation of XXAI, the\ntheoretical and methodological foundations for its further development, and\ndiscuss prospects for the future.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal information extraction (MIE) gains significant attention as the\npopularity of multimedia content increases. However, current MIE methods often\nresort to using task-specific model structures, which results in limited\ngeneralizability across tasks and underutilizes shared knowledge across MIE\ntasks. To address these issues, we propose UMIE, a unified multimodal\ninformation extractor to unify three MIE tasks as a generation problem using\ninstruction tuning, being able to effectively extract both textual and visual\nmentions. Extensive experiments show that our single UMIE outperforms various\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) methods across six MIE datasets on three tasks.\nFurthermore, in-depth analysis demonstrates UMIE's strong generalization in the\nzero-shot setting, robustness to instruction variants, and interpretability.\nOur research serves as an initial step towards a unified MIE model and\ninitiates the exploration into both instruction tuning and large language\nmodels within the MIE domain.

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) is the cornerstone for a\nbroad range of emerging services in next-generation wireless networks. URLLC\nfundamentally relies on the network's ability to proactively determine whether\nsufficient resources are available to support the URLLC traffic, and thus,\nprevent so-called cell overloads. Nonetheless, achieving accurate\nquality-of-service (QoS) predictions for URLLC user equipment (UEs) and\npreventing cell overloads are very challenging tasks. This is due to dependency\nof the QoS metrics (latency and reliability) on traffic and channel statistics,\nusers' mobility, and interdependent performance across UEs. In this paper, a\nnew QoS-aware UE admission control approach is developed to proactively\nestimate QoS for URLLC UEs, prior to associating them with a cell, and\naccordingly, admit only a subset of UEs that do not lead to a cell overload. To\nthis end, an optimization problem is formulated to find an efficient UE\nadmission control policy, cognizant of UEs' QoS requirements and cell-level\nload dynamics. To solve this problem, a new machine learning based method is\nproposed that builds on (deep) neural contextual bandits, a suitable framework\nfor dealing with nonlinear bandit problems. In fact, the UE admission\ncontroller is treated as a bandit agent that observes a set of network\nmeasurements (context) and makes admission control decisions based on\ncontext-dependent QoS (reward) predictions. The simulation results show that\nthe proposed scheme can achieve near-optimal performance and yield substantial\ngains in terms of cell-level service reliability and efficient resource\nutilization.",

Previous work has shown that machine learning (ML)-driven\napproaches outperform traditional techniques, such as autoscaling, in terms of\nboth SLA maintenance and resource efficiency. However, ML-driven approaches\nalso face challenges including lengthy data collection processes and limited\nscalability. We present Ursa, a lightweight resource management system for\ncloud-native microservices that addresses these challenges. Ursa uses an\nanalytical model that decomposes the end-to-end SLA into per-service SLA, and\nmaps per-service SLA to individual resource allocations per microservice tier.\nTo speed up the exploration process and avoid prolonged SLA violations, Ursa\nexplores each microservice individually, and swiftly stops exploration if\nlatency exceeds its SLA.\n  We evaluate Ursa on a set of representative and end-to-end microservice\ntopologies, including a social network, media service and video processing\npipeline, each consisting of multiple classes and priorities of requests with\ndifferent SLAs, and compare it against two representative ML-driven systems,\nSinan and Firm. Compared to these ML-driven approaches, Ursa provides\nsignificant advantages: It shortens the data collection process by more than\n128x, and its control plane is 43x faster than ML-driven approaches. At the\nsame time, Ursa does not sacrifice resource efficiency or SLAs. During online\ndeployment, Ursa reduces the SLA violation rate by 9.0% up to 49.9%, and\nreduces CPU allocation by up to 86.2% compared to ML-driven approaches.",

    "abstract": "For solving problems from the domain of Mobility-on-Demand (MoD), we often\nneed to connect vehicle plans into plans spanning longer time, a process we\ncall plan chaining. As we show in this work, chaining of the plans can be used\nto reduce the size of MoD providers' fleet (fleet-sizing problem) but also to\nreduce the total driven distance by providing high-quality vehicle dispatching\nsolutions in MoD systems. Recently, a solution that uses this principle has\nbeen proposed to solve the fleet-sizing problem. The method does not consider\nthe time flexibility of the plans. Instead, plans are fixed in time and cannot\nbe delayed. However, time flexibility is an essential property of all vehicle\nproblems with time windows. This work presents a new plan chaining formulation\nthat considers delays as allowed by the time windows and a solution method for\nsolving it. Moreover, we prove that the proposed plan chaining method is\noptimal, and we analyze its complexity. Finally, we list some practical\napplications and perform a demonstration for one of them: a new heuristic\nvehicle dispatching method for solving the static dial-a-ride problem. The\ndemonstration results show that our proposed method provides a better solution\nthan the two heuristic baselines for the majority of instances that cannot be\nsolved optimally. At the same time, our method does not have the largest\ncomputational time requirements compared to the baselines. Therefore, we\nconclude that the proposed optimal chaining method provides not only\ntheoretically sound results but is also practically applicable.",

Integrating such advancements in\nspeech generation with large language models might revolutionize a wide range\nof applications. However, certain applications, such as assistive\nconversational systems, require natural and conversational speech generation\ntools that also operate efficiently in real time. Current state-of-the-art\nmodels like VALL-E and SoundStorm, powered by hierarchical neural audio codecs,\nrequire large neural components and extensive training data to work well. In\ncontrast, MQTTS aims to build more compact conversational TTS models while\ncapitalizing on smaller-scale real-life conversational speech data. However,\nits autoregressive nature yields high inference latency and thus limits its\nreal-time usage. In order to mitigate the current limitations of the\nstate-of-the-art TTS models while capitalizing on their strengths, in this work\nwe introduce the Pheme model series that 1) offers compact yet high-performing\nmodels, 2) allows for parallel speech generation of 3) natural conversational\nspeech, and 4) it can be trained efficiently on smaller-scale conversational\ndata, cutting data demands by more than 10x but still matching the quality of\nthe autoregressive TTS models. We also show that through simple teacher-student\ndistillation we can meet significant improvements in voice quality for\nsingle-speaker setups on top of pretrained Pheme checkpoints, relying solely on\nsynthetic speech generated by much larger teacher models.

Fortunately, the widespread\navailability of smartphones with high-quality cameras has made citizen\njournalism through social media a valuable source of information for crisis\nresponders. However, analyzing the large volume of images posted by citizens\nrequires more time and effort than is typically available.

We further assess the consistency of performance metrics across\ntraditional measures, GPT-4, and human ratings for both VQA and MRG tasks. The\nresults indicate that semantic similarity assessments using GPT-4 align closely\nwith human annotators and provide greater stability, yet they reveal a\ndiscrepancy when compared to conventional lexical similarity measurements. This\nquestions the reliability of lexical similarity metrics for evaluating the\nperformance of generative models in Med-VQA and report generation tasks.\nBesides, our fine-tuned model significantly outperforms GPT-4v.

Confidence-based pruning (CBP) (Cheng and Vlachos, 2023) has recently\nbeen proposed to reduce the inference time in machine translation tasks.\nAlthough it is shown to significantly reduce the amount of computation, it\nrequires hyperparameter tuning using a development set to be effective. To this\nend, we propose Approximate Minimum Bayes-Risk (AMBR) decoding, a\nhyperparameter-free method to run MBR decoding approximately. AMBR is derived\nfrom the observation that the problem of computing the sample-based MBR\nobjective is the medoid identification problem. AMBR uses the Correlated\nSequential Halving (CSH) algorithm (Baharav and Tse, 2019), the best\napproximation algorithm to date for the medoid identification problem, to\ncompute the sample-based MBR objective. We evaluate AMBR on machine\ntranslation, text summarization, and image captioning tasks. The results show\nthat AMBR achieves on par with CBP, with CBP selecting hyperparameters through\nan Oracle for each given computation budget.",

The objective is to ascertain the authenticity of a\nprovided handwritten signature, distinguishing between genuine and forged ones.\nThis issue has many applications in sectors such as finance, legal\ndocumentation, and security. Currently, the field of computer vision and\nmachine learning has made significant progress in the domain of handwritten\nsignature verification. The outcomes, however, may be enhanced depending on the\nacquired findings, the structure of the datasets, and the used models. Four\nstages make up our suggested strategy. First, we collected a large dataset of\n12600 images from 420 distinct individuals, and each individual has 30\nsignatures of a certain kind (All authors signatures are genuine). In the\nsubsequent stage, the best features from each image were extracted using a deep\nlearning model named MobileNetV2. During the feature selection step, three\nselectors neighborhood component analysis (NCA), Chi2, and mutual info (MI)\nwere used to pull out 200, 300, 400, and 500 features, giving a total of 12\nfeature vectors. Finally, 12 results have been obtained by applying machine\nlearning techniques such as SVM with kernels (rbf, poly, and linear), KNN, DT,\nLinear Discriminant Analysis, and Naive Bayes. Without employing feature\nselection techniques, our suggested offline signature verification achieved a\nclassification accuracy of 91.3%, whereas using the NCA feature selection\napproach with just 300 features it achieved a classification accuracy of 97.7%.\nHigh classification accuracy was achieved using the designed and suggested\nmodel, which also has the benefit of being a self-organized framework.\nConsequently, using the optimum minimally chosen features, the proposed method\ncould identify the best model performance and result validation prediction\nvectors.",

Unlike the\nlarge volume of existing studies that rely on learning from paired real data,\nwe attempt to learn a demoireing model from unpaired real data, i.e., moire\nimages associated with irrelevant clean images. The proposed method, referred\nto as Unpaired Demoireing (UnDeM), synthesizes pseudo moire images from\nunpaired datasets, generating pairs with clean images for training demoireing\nmodels. To achieve this, we divide real moire images into patches and group\nthem in compliance with their moire complexity.

This leads to the development of multimodal learning in segmentation.\nHowever, the redundancy among modalities creates challenges for existing\nsubtraction-based joint learning methods, such as misjudging the importance of\nmodalities, ignoring specific modal information, and increasing cognitive load.\nThese thorny issues ultimately decrease segmentation accuracy and increase the\nrisk of overfitting. This paper presents the complementary information mutual\nlearning (CIML) framework, which can mathematically model and address the\nnegative impact of inter-modal redundant information. CIML adopts the idea of\naddition and removes inter-modal redundant information through inductive\nbias-driven task decomposition and message passing-based redundancy filtering.\nCIML first decomposes the multimodal segmentation task into multiple subtasks\nbased on expert prior knowledge, minimizing the information dependence between\nmodalities. Furthermore, CIML introduces a scheme in which each modality can\nextract information from other modalities additively through message passing.\nTo achieve non-redundancy of extracted information, the redundant filtering is\ntransformed into complementary information learning inspired by the variational\ninformation bottleneck. The complementary information learning procedure can be\nefficiently solved by variational inference and cross-modal spatial attention.\nNumerical results from the verification task and standard benchmarks indicate\nthat CIML efficiently removes redundant information between modalities,\noutperforming SOTA methods regarding validation accuracy and segmentation\neffect.",

Previous studies have showed that\nranking and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)loss functions are widely-used\nfor survival analysis. However, ranking loss only focus on the ranking of\nsurvival time and does not consider potential effect of samples for exact\nsurvival time values. Furthermore, the MLE is unbounded and easily subject to\noutliers (e.g., censored data), which may cause poor performance of modeling.\nTo handle the complexities of learning process and exploit valuable survival\ntime values, we propose a time-adaptive coordinate loss function, TripleSurv,\nto achieve adaptive adjustments by introducing the differences in the survival\ntime between sample pairs into the ranking, which can encourage the model to\nquantitatively rank relative risk of pairs, ultimately enhancing the accuracy\nof predictions. Most importantly, the TripleSurv is proficient in quantifying\nthe relative risk between samples by ranking ordering of pairs, and consider\nthe time interval as a trade-off to calibrate the robustness of model over\nsample distribution. Our TripleSurv is evaluated on three real-world survival\ndatasets and a public synthetic dataset.

    "abstract": "Explanations on relational data are hard to verify since the explanation\nstructures are more complex (e.g. graphs). To verify interpretable explanations\n(e.g. explanations of predictions made in images, text, etc.), typically human\nsubjects are used since it does not necessarily require a lot of expertise.\nHowever, to verify the quality of a relational explanation requires expertise\nand is hard to scale-up. GNNExplainer is arguably one of the most popular\nexplanation methods for Graph Neural Networks. In this paper, we develop an\napproach where we assess the uncertainty in explanations generated by\nGNNExplainer. Specifically, we ask the explainer to generate explanations for\nseveral counterfactual examples. We generate these examples as symmetric\napproximations of the relational structure in the original data. From these\nexplanations, we learn a factor graph model to quantify uncertainty in an\nexplanation. Our results on several datasets show that our approach can help\nverify explanations from GNNExplainer by reliably estimating the uncertainty of\na relation specified in the explanation.",

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models have shown great potential in multiple research\nareas. Existing diffusion-based generative methods on de novo 3D molecule\ngeneration face two major challenges. Since majority heavy atoms in molecules\nallow connections to multiple atoms through single bonds, solely using\npair-wise distance to model molecule geometries is insufficient. Therefore, the\nfirst one involves proposing an effective neural network as the denoising\nkernel that is capable to capture complex multi-body interatomic relationships\nand learn high-quality features. Due to the discrete nature of graphs,\nmainstream diffusion-based methods for molecules heavily rely on predefined\nrules and generate edges in an indirect manner. The second challenge involves\naccommodating molecule generation to diffusion and accurately predicting the\nexistence of bonds. In our research, we view the iterative way of updating\nmolecule conformations in diffusion process is consistent with molecular\ndynamics and introduce a novel molecule generation method named\nGeometric-Facilitated Molecular Diffusion (GFMDiff). For the first challenge,\nwe introduce a Dual-Track Transformer Network (DTN) to fully excevate global\nspatial relationships and learn high quality representations which contribute\nto accurate predictions of features and geometries. As for the second\nchallenge, we design Geometric-Facilitated Loss (GFLoss) which intervenes the\nformation of bonds during the training period, instead of directly embedding\nedges into the latent space. Comprehensive experiments on current benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of GFMDiff.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models capable of\nprocessing graph-structured data, and they have demonstrated significant\nperformance in a variety of real-world applications. Recent studies have found\nthat GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns\n(called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input\ndata, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies\nthe input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas\nwhen there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the\nGNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are\nhighly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently,\nresearch on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph\nclassification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link\nprediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor\nattack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence\nof such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN\nmodels to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship\nwhen a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison\nselected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be\nembedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference\nstage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the\ntrigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data,\ncausing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the\ntarget node pairs.",

    "abstract": "Among the most insidious attacks on Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions are\ntraining-time attacks (TTAs) that create loopholes and backdoors in the learned\nbehaviour. Not limited to a simple disruption, constructive TTAs (C-TTAs) are\nnow available, where the attacker forces a specific, target behaviour upon a\ntraining RL agent (victim). However, even state-of-the-art C-TTAs focus on\ntarget behaviours that could be naturally adopted by the victim if not for a\nparticular feature of the environment dynamics, which C-TTAs exploit. In this\nwork, we show that a C-TTA is possible even when the target behaviour is\nun-adoptable due to both environment dynamics as well as non-optimality with\nrespect to the victim objective(s). To find efficient attacks in this context,\nwe develop a specialised flavour of the DDPG algorithm, which we term\ngammaDDPG, that learns this stronger version of C-TTA. gammaDDPG dynamically\nalters the attack policy planning horizon based on the victim's current\nbehaviour. This improves effort distribution throughout the attack timeline and\nreduces the effect of uncertainty the attacker has about the victim. To\ndemonstrate the features of our method and better relate the results to prior\nresearch, we borrow a 3D grid domain from a state-of-the-art C-TTA for our\nexperiments.

    "abstract": "While AI-generated text and 2D images continue to expand its territory, 3D\ngeneration has gradually emerged as a trend that cannot be ignored. Since the\nyear 2023 an abundant amount of research papers has emerged in the domain of 3D\ngeneration. This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but\nalso the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key\nfactors contribute to this progress. The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion,\ncoupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic\nhuman models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D\nmodels with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances. The\nadvancements in neural network-based 3D storing and rendering models, such as\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have\naccelerated the efficiency and realism of neural rendered models. Furthermore,\nthe multimodality capabilities of large language models have enabled language\ninputs to transcend into human motion outputs. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview and summary of the relevant papers published mostly\nduring the latter half year of 2023. It will begin by discussing the AI\ngenerated object models in 3D, followed by the generated 3D human models, and\nfinally, the generated 3D human motions, culminating in a conclusive summary\nand a vision for the future.",

    "abstract": "The abilities of humans to understand the world in terms of cause and effect\nrelationships, as well as to compress information into abstract concepts, are\ntwo hallmark features of human intelligence. These two topics have been studied\nin tandem in the literature under the rubric of causal abstractions theory. In\npractice, it remains an open problem how to best leverage abstraction theory in\nreal-world causal inference tasks, where the true mechanisms are unknown and\nonly limited data is available. In this paper, we develop a new family of\ncausal abstractions by clustering variables and their domains. This approach\nrefines and generalizes previous notions of abstractions to better accommodate\nindividual causal distributions that are spawned by Pearl's causal hierarchy.\nWe show that such abstractions are learnable in practical settings through\nNeural Causal Models (Xia et al., 2021), enabling the use of the deep learning\ntoolkit to solve various challenging causal inference tasks -- identification,\nestimation, sampling -- at different levels of granularity. Finally, we\nintegrate these results with representation learning to create more flexible\nabstractions, moving these results closer to practical applications. Our\nexperiments support the theory and illustrate how to scale causal inferences to\nhigh-dimensional settings involving image data.",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attack against image classification task has been widely studied and\nproven to be successful, while there exist little research on the backdoor\nattack against vision-language models. In this paper, we explore backdoor\nattack towards image captioning models by poisoning training data. Assuming the\nattacker has total access to the training dataset, and cannot intervene in\nmodel construction or training process. Specifically, a portion of benign\ntraining samples is randomly selected to be poisoned. Afterwards, considering\nthat the captions are usually unfolded around objects in an image, we design an\nobject-oriented method to craft poisons, which aims to modify pixel values by a\nslight range with the modification number proportional to the scale of the\ncurrent detected object region. After training with the poisoned data, the\nattacked model behaves normally on benign images, but for poisoned images, the\nmodel will generate some sentences irrelevant to the given image. The attack\ncontrols the model behavior on specific test images without sacrificing the\ngeneration performance on benign test images. Our method proves the weakness of\nimage captioning models to backdoor attack and we hope this work can raise the\nawareness of defending against backdoor attack in the image captioning field.",

    "abstract": "Federated Domain Generalization aims to learn a domain-invariant model from\nmultiple decentralized source domains for deployment on unseen target domain.\nDue to privacy concerns, the data from different source domains are kept\nisolated, which poses challenges in bridging the domain gap. To address this\nissue, we propose a Multi-source Collaborative Gradient Discrepancy\nMinimization (MCGDM) method for federated domain generalization. Specifically,\nwe propose intra-domain gradient matching between the original images and\naugmented images to avoid overfitting the domain-specific information within\nisolated domains. Additionally, we propose inter-domain gradient matching with\nthe collaboration of other domains, which can further reduce the domain shift\nacross decentralized domains. Combining intra-domain and inter-domain gradient\nmatching, our method enables the learned model to generalize well on unseen\ndomains. Furthermore, our method can be extended to the federated domain\nadaptation task by fine-tuning the target model on the pseudo-labeled target\ndomain. The extensive experiments on federated domain generalization and\nadaptation indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nsignificantly.",

    "abstract": "In the forthcoming era of big astronomical data, it is a burden to find out\ntarget sources from ground-based and space-based telescopes. Although Machine\nLearning (ML) methods have been extensively utilized to address this issue, the\nincorporation of in-depth data analysis can significantly enhance the\nefficiency of identifying target sources when dealing with massive volumes of\nastronomical data. In this work, we focused on the task of finding AGN\ncandidates and identifying BL Lac/FSRQ candidates from the 4FGL DR3 uncertain\nsources. We studied the correlations among the attributes of the 4FGL DR3\ncatalogue and proposed a novel method, named FDIDWT, to transform the original\ndata. The transformed dataset is characterized as low-dimensional and\nfeature-highlighted, with the estimation of correlation features by Fractal\nDimension (FD) theory and the multi-resolution analysis by Inverse Discrete\nWavelet Transform (IDWT). Combining the FDIDWT method with an improved\nlightweight MatchboxConv1D model, we accomplished two missions: (1) to\ndistinguish the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) from others (Non-AGNs) in the\n4FGL DR3 uncertain sources with an accuracy of 96.65%, namely, Mission A; (2)\nto classify blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs) into BL Lacertae objects\n(BL Lacs) or Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) with an accuracy of 92.03%,\nnamely, Mission B. There are 1354 AGN candidates in Mission A, 482 BL Lacs\ncandidates and 128 FSRQ candidates in Mission B were found. The results show a\nhigh consistency of greater than 98% with the results in previous works. In\naddition, our method has the advantage of finding less variable and relatively\nfaint sources than ordinary methods.",

    "abstract": "One of the most challenging issues in federated learning is that the data is\noften not independent and identically distributed (nonIID). Clients are\nexpected to contribute the same type of data and drawn from one global\ndistribution. However, data are often collected in different ways from\ndifferent resources. Thus, the data distributions among clients might be\ndifferent from the underlying global distribution. This creates a weight\ndivergence issue and reduces federated learning performance. This work focuses\non improving federated learning performance for skewed data distribution across\nclients. The main idea is to adjust the client distribution closer to the\nglobal distribution using sample weights. Thus, the machine learning model\nconverges faster with higher accuracy. We start from the fundamental concept of\nempirical risk minimization and theoretically derive a solution for adjusting\nthe distribution skewness using sample weights. To determine sample weights, we\nimplicitly exchange density information by leveraging a neural network-based\ndensity estimation model, MADE. The clients data distribution can then be\nadjusted without exposing their raw data. Our experiment results on three\nreal-world datasets show that the proposed method not only improves federated\nlearning accuracy but also significantly reduces communication costs compared\nto the other experimental methods.",

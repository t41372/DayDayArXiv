    "abstract": "Reasoning ability is crucial for solving challenging tasks. With the\nadvancement of foundation models, such as the emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs), a wide range of reasoning strategies has been proposed,\nincluding test-time enhancements, such as Chain-ofThought, and post-training\noptimizations, as used in DeepSeek-R1. While these reasoning strategies have\ndemonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks,\ntheir applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly\nthe challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is\nunclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of\nreasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS,\nthe first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular\nreasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts\ncomprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both\nunimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More\nimportantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the\nmost effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy\noptimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning\nability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning\nstrategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes\ntwo pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning\nresearch: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples\nannotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A\nnew and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models\nenabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into many\ntechnological ecosystems across various domains and industries, identifying\nwhich model is deployed or being interacted with is critical for the security\nand trustworthiness of the systems. Current verification methods typically rely\non analyzing the generated output to determine the source model. However, these\ntechniques are susceptible to adversarial attacks, operate in a post-hoc\nmanner, and may require access to the model weights to inject a verifiable\nfingerprint. In this paper, we propose a novel passive and non-invasive\nfingerprinting technique that operates in real-time and remains effective even\nunder encrypted network traffic conditions. Our method leverages the intrinsic\nautoregressive generation nature of language models, which generate text one\ntoken at a time based on all previously generated tokens, creating a unique\ntemporal pattern like a rhythm or heartbeat that persists even when the output\nis streamed over a network. We find that measuring the Inter-Token Times\n(ITTs)-time intervals between consecutive tokens-can identify different\nlanguage models with high accuracy. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) pipeline to\ncapture these timing patterns using network traffic analysis and evaluate it on\n16 Small Language Models (SLMs) and 10 proprietary LLMs across different\ndeployment scenarios, including local host machine (GPU/CPU), Local Area\nNetwork (LAN), Remote Network, and Virtual Private Network (VPN). The\nexperimental results confirm that our proposed technique is effective and\nmaintains high accuracy even when tested in different network conditions. This\nwork opens a new avenue for model identification in real-world scenarios and\ncontributes to more secure and trustworthy language model deployment.",

MSAE establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art Pareto frontier between reconstruction quality and sparsity\nfor CLIP, achieving 0.99 cosine similarity and less than 0.1 fraction of\nvariance unexplained while maintaining ~80% sparsity.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is vital in fields like weather,\nenergy, and finance. However, despite deep learning advancements, traditional\nTransformer-based models often diminish the effect of crucial inter-variable\nrelationships by singular token embedding and struggle to effectively capture\ncomplex dependencies among variables, especially in datasets with rare or\nextreme events. These events create significant imbalances and lead to high\nskewness, complicating accurate prediction efforts. This study introduces\nPFformer, a position-free Transformer-based model designed for single-target\nMTS forecasting, specifically for challenging datasets characterized by extreme\nvariability. PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced\nFeature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE\neffectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence\nsubsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing\nthe encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy\nwithout the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We\nevaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key\nforecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling\npredictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in\nwater management.

To achieve this, previous works have used\nGaussian processes (GPs) to perform uncertainty calibration for the attention\nunits of transformers and attained notable successes. However, such approaches\nhave to confine the transformers to the space of symmetric attention to ensure\nthe necessary symmetric requirement of their GP's kernel specification, which\nreduces the representation capacity of the model. To mitigate this restriction,\nwe propose the Correlated Gaussian Process Transformer (CGPT), a new class of\ntransformers whose self-attention units are modeled as cross-covariance between\ntwo correlated GPs (CGPs). This allows asymmetries in attention and can enhance\nthe representation capacity of GP-based transformers. We also derive a sparse\napproximation for CGP to make it scale better. Our empirical studies show that\nboth CGP-based and sparse CGP-based transformers achieve better performance\nthan state-of-the-art GP-based transformers on a variety of benchmark tasks.\nThe code for our experiments is available at\nhttps://github.com/MinhLong210/CGP-Transformers.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable\nadvancements in embodying diverse personas, enhancing their effectiveness as\nconversational agents and virtual assistants. Consequently, LLMs have made\nsignificant strides in processing and integrating multimodal information.\nHowever, even though human personas can be expressed in both text and image,\nthe extent to which the modality of a persona impacts the embodiment by the LLM\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how do different\nmodalities influence the expressiveness of personas in multimodal LLMs. To this\nend, we create a novel modality-parallel dataset of 40 diverse personas varying\nin age, gender, occupation, and location. This consists of four modalities to\nequivalently represent a persona: image-only, text-only, a combination of image\nand small text, and typographical images, where text is visually stylized to\nconvey persona-related attributes. We then create a systematic evaluation\nframework with 60 questions and corresponding metrics to assess how well LLMs\nembody each persona across its attributes and scenarios. Comprehensive\nexperiments on $5$ multimodal LLMs show that personas represented by detailed\ntext show more linguistic habits, while typographical images often show more\nconsistency with the persona. Our results reveal that LLMs often overlook\npersona-specific details conveyed through images, highlighting underlying\nlimitations and paving the way for future research to bridge this gap.

    "abstract": "To answer one-to-many factual queries (e.g., listing cities of a country), a\nlanguage model (LM) must simultaneously recall knowledge and avoid repeating\nprevious answers. How are these two subtasks implemented and integrated\ninternally? Across multiple datasets and models, we identify a\npromote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then\nsuppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject\nand previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention\npropagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention\nattends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the\nsuppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental\nevidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze\nhow components use different tokens by introducing both Token Lens, which\ndecodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout\nmethod that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to\nspecified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal\ncomponents interact with different input tokens to support complex factual\nrecall.

However, most\nworks that study them in incremental settings assume either a static concept\nset across all experiences or assume that each experience relies on a distinct\nset of concepts. In this work, we study concept-based models in a more\nrealistic, dynamic setting where new classes may rely on older concepts in\naddition to introducing new concepts themselves. We show that concepts and\nclasses form a complex web of relationships, which is susceptible to\ndegradation and needs to be preserved and augmented across experiences. We\nintroduce new metrics to show that existing concept-based models cannot\npreserve these relationships even when trained using methods to prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting, since they cannot handle forgetting at concept, class,\nand concept-class relationship levels simultaneously. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel method - MuCIL - that uses multimodal concepts to perform\nclassification without increasing the number of trainable parameters across\nexperiences. The multimodal concepts are aligned to concepts provided in\nnatural language, making them interpretable by design. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art\nclassification performance compared to other concept-based models, achieving\nover 2$\\times$ the classification performance in some cases.

BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency\nand reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong\ngeneralization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and\nself-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify\noutputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising\nnew dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have positioned AI, and particularly Large Language\nModels (LLMs), as transformative tools for scientific research, capable of\naddressing complex tasks that require reasoning, problem-solving, and\ndecision-making. Their exceptional capabilities suggest their potential as\nscientific research assistants but also highlight the need for holistic,\nrigorous, and domain-specific evaluation to assess effectiveness in real-world\nscientific applications. This paper describes a multifaceted methodology for\nEvaluating AI models as scientific Research Assistants (EAIRA) developed at\nArgonne National Laboratory. This methodology incorporates four primary classes\nof evaluations. 1) Multiple Choice Questions to assess factual recall; 2) Open\nResponse to evaluate advanced reasoning and problem-solving skills; 3)\nLab-Style Experiments involving detailed analysis of capabilities as research\nassistants in controlled environments; and 4) Field-Style Experiments to\ncapture researcher-LLM interactions at scale in a wide range of scientific\ndomains and applications. These complementary methods enable a comprehensive\nanalysis of LLM strengths and weaknesses with respect to their scientific\nknowledge, reasoning abilities, and adaptability. Recognizing the rapid pace of\nLLM advancements, we designed the methodology to evolve and adapt so as to\nensure its continued relevance and applicability. This paper describes the\nmethodology state at the end of February 2025. Although developed within a\nsubset of scientific domains, the methodology is designed to be generalizable\nto a wide range of scientific domains.",

In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We present\nM3Builder, a novel multi-agent system designed to automate machine learning\n(ML) in medical imaging. At its core, M3Builder employs four specialized agents\nthat collaborate to tackle complex, multi-step medical ML workflows, from\nautomated data processing and environment configuration to self-contained auto\ndebugging and model training. These agents operate within a medical imaging ML\nworkspace, a structured environment designed to provide agents with free-text\ndescriptions of datasets, training codes, and interaction tools, enabling\nseamless communication and task execution. (ii) To evaluate progress in\nautomated medical imaging ML, we propose M3Bench, a benchmark comprising four\ngeneral tasks on 14 training datasets, across five anatomies and three imaging\nmodalities, covering both 2D and 3D data. (iii) We experiment with seven\nstate-of-the-art large language models serving as agent cores for our system,\nsuch as Claude series, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3. Compared to existing ML agentic\ndesigns, M3Builder shows superior performance on completing ML tasks in medical\nimaging, achieving a 94.29% success rate using Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the agent\ncore, showing huge potential towards fully automated machine learning in\nmedical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Fake news poses global risks by influencing elections and spreading\nmisinformation, making detection critical. Existing NLP and supervised Machine\nLearning methods perform well under cross-validation but struggle to generalise\nacross datasets, even within the same domain. This issue stems from coarsely\nlabelled training data, where articles are labelled based on their publisher,\nintroducing biases that token-based models like TF-IDF and BERT are sensitive\nto. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, their application in fake\nnews detection remains limited. This study demonstrates that meaningful\nfeatures can still be extracted from coarsely labelled data to improve\nreal-world robustness. Stylistic features-lexical, syntactic, and semantic-are\nexplored due to their reduced sensitivity to dataset biases. Additionally,\nnovel social-monetisation features are introduced, capturing economic\nincentives behind fake news, such as advertisements, external links, and social\nmedia elements. The study trains on the coarsely labelled NELA 2020-21 dataset\nand evaluates using the manually labelled Facebook URLs dataset, a gold\nstandard for generalisability. Results highlight the limitations of token-based\nmodels trained on biased data and contribute to the scarce evidence on LLMs\nlike LLaMa in this field. Findings indicate that stylistic and\nsocial-monetisation features offer more generalisable predictions than\ntoken-based methods and LLMs. Statistical and permutation feature importance\nanalyses further reveal their potential to enhance performance and mitigate\ndataset biases, providing a path forward for improving fake news detection.",

In this paper, we explore\nthe use of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for transcribing\nmulti-page handwritten documents in a zero-shot setting. We investigate various\nconfigurations of commercial OCR engines and MLLMs, utilizing the latter both\nas end-to-end transcribers and as post-processors, with and without image\ncomponents. We propose a novel method, '+first page', which enhances MLLM\ntranscription by providing the OCR output of the entire document along with\njust the first page image. This approach leverages shared document features\nwithout incurring the high cost of processing all images. Experiments on a\nmulti-page version of the IAM Handwriting Database demonstrate that '+first\npage' improves transcription accuracy, balances cost with performance, and even\nenhances results on out-of-sample text by extrapolating formatting and OCR\nerror patterns from a single page.",

    "abstract": "Infections in Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) can cause severe complications,\nincluding tissue death and limb amputation, highlighting the need for accurate,\ntimely diagnosis. Previous machine learning methods have focused on identifying\ninfections by analyzing wound images alone, without utilizing additional\nmetadata such as medical notes. In this study, we aim to improve infection\ndetection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound\nInfection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages\nsynthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two\ncomponents: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on\nGPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images;\nand (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract\ncross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption.\nInfection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a\nlabeled support set. To enhance the diversity of training data, we utilized a\nlatent diffusion model to generate additional wound images. As a result,\nSCARWID outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average sensitivity,\nspecificity, and accuracy of 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for wound\ninfection classification. Displaying the generated captions alongside the wound\nimages and infection detection results enhances interpretability and trust,\nenabling nurses to align SCARWID outputs with their medical knowledge. This is\nparticularly valuable when wound notes are unavailable or when assisting novice\nnurses who may find it difficult to identify visual attributes of wound\ninfection.",

While converting the images using Hue, Saturation and\nValue (HSV) color space helps resolve the brightness issue, it introduces\nsignificant red and black noise artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a\nnew color space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined\nby polarized HS maps and learnable intensity. The former enforces small\ndistances for red coordinates to remove the red artifacts, while the latter\ncompresses the low-light regions to remove the black artifacts. To fully\nleverage the chromatic and intensity information, a novel Color and Intensity\nDecoupling Network (CIDNet) is further introduced to learn accurate photometric\nmapping function under different lighting conditions in the HVI space.\nComprehensive results from benchmark and ablation experiments show that the\nproposed HVI color space with CIDNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\non 10 datasets.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks can acquire many aspects of human knowledge from\ndata, making them promising as models of human learning. But what those\nnetworks can learn depends upon their inductive biases -- the factors other\nthan the data that influence the solutions they discover -- and the inductive\nbiases of neural networks remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to\ndraw conclusions about human learning from the performance of these systems.\nCognitive scientists and machine learning researchers often focus on the\narchitecture of a neural network as a source of inductive bias. In this paper\nwe explore the impact of another source of inductive bias -- the initial\nweights of the network -- using meta-learning as a tool for finding initial\nweights that are adapted for specific problems. We evaluate four widely-used\narchitectures -- MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers -- by meta-training 430\ndifferent models across three tasks requiring different biases and forms of\ngeneralization. We find that meta-learning can substantially reduce or entirely\neliminate performance differences across architectures and data\nrepresentations, suggesting that these factors may be less important as sources\nof inductive bias than is typically assumed. When differences are present,\narchitectures and data representations that perform well without meta-learning\ntend to meta-train more effectively. Moreover, all architectures generalize\npoorly on problems that are far from their meta-training experience,\nunderscoring the need for stronger inductive biases for robust generalization.",

    "abstract": "As the demands for superior agents grow, the training complexity of Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) becomes higher. Thus, accelerating training of DRL\nhas become a major research focus. Dividing the DRL training process into\nsubtasks and using parallel computation can effectively reduce training costs.\nHowever, current DRL training systems lack sufficient parallelization due to\ndata assignment between subtask components. This assignment issue has been\nignored, but addressing it can further boost training efficiency. Therefore, we\npropose a high-throughput distributed RL training system called TianJi. It\nrelaxes assignment dependencies between subtask components and enables\nevent-driven asynchronous communication. Meanwhile, TianJi maintains clear\nboundaries between subtask components. To address convergence uncertainty from\nrelaxed assignment dependencies, TianJi proposes a distributed strategy based\non the balance of sample production and consumption. The strategy controls the\nstaleness of samples to correct their quality, ensuring convergence. We\nconducted extensive experiments. TianJi achieves a convergence time\nacceleration ratio of up to 4.37 compared to related comparison systems. When\nscaled to eight computational nodes, TianJi shows a convergence time speedup of\n1.6 and a throughput speedup of 7.13 relative to XingTian, demonstrating its\ncapability to accelerate training and scalability. In data transmission\nefficiency experiments, TianJi significantly outperforms other systems,\napproaching hardware limits. TianJi also shows effectiveness in on-policy\nalgorithms, achieving convergence time acceleration ratios of 4.36 and 2.95\ncompared to RLlib and XingTian.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for robot learning.\nHowever, model-free RL (MFRL) requires a large number of environment\ninteractions to learn successful control policies. This is due to the noisy RL\ntraining updates and the complexity of robotic systems, which typically involve\nhighly non-linear dynamics and noisy sensor signals. In contrast, model-based\nRL (MBRL) not only trains a policy but simultaneously learns a world model that\ncaptures the environment's dynamics and rewards. The world model can either be\nused for planning, for data collection, or to provide first-order policy\ngradients for training. Leveraging a world model significantly improves sample\nefficiency compared to model-free RL. However, training a world model alongside\nthe policy increases the computational complexity, leading to longer training\ntimes that are often intractable for complex real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we propose a new method for accelerating model-based RL using state-space\nworld models. Our approach leverages state-space models (SSMs) to parallelize\nthe training of the dynamics model, which is typically the main computational\nbottleneck. Additionally, we propose an architecture that provides privileged\ninformation to the world model during training, which is particularly relevant\nfor partially observable environments. We evaluate our method in several\nreal-world agile quadrotor flight tasks, involving complex dynamics, for both\nfully and partially observable environments. We demonstrate a significant\nspeedup, reducing the world model training time by up to 10 times, and the\noverall MBRL training time by up to 4 times. This benefit comes without\ncompromising performance, as our method achieves similar sample efficiency and\ntask rewards to state-of-the-art MBRL methods.",

The H&E-to-IHC transformation\nbased on generative models provides a simple and cost-effective method for\nobtaining IHC images. Although previous models can perform digital coloring\nwell, they still suffer from (i) coloring only through the pixel features that\nare not prominent in HE, which is easy to cause information loss in the\ncoloring process; (ii) The lack of pixel-perfect H&E-IHC groundtruth pairs\nposes a challenge to the classical L1 loss.To address the above challenges, we\npropose an adaptive information enhanced coloring framework based on feature\nextractors. We first propose the VMFE module to effectively extract the color\ninformation features using multi-scale feature extraction and wavelet transform\nconvolution, while combining the shared decoder for feature fusion. The\nhigh-performance dual feature extractor of H&E-IHC is trained by contrastive\nlearning, which can effectively perform feature alignment of HE-IHC in high\nlatitude space. At the same time, the trained feature encoder is used to\nenhance the features and adaptively adjust the loss in the HE section staining\nprocess to solve the problems related to unclear and asymmetric information.

Towards that goal, we introduce the Quadratic Programming Enhanced\nModel (QPM), which learns globally interpretable class representations.

This compact binary assignment is found\nusing discrete optimization based on predefined similarity measures and\ninterpretability constraints. The resulting optimal assignment is used to\nfine-tune the diverse features, so that each of them becomes the shared general\nconcept between the assigned classes.

However, existing OWCL methods\noften treat open detection and continual learning as separate tasks, limiting\ntheir ability to integrate open-set detection and incremental classification in\nOWCL. Moreover, current approaches primarily focus on transferring knowledge\nfrom known samples, neglecting the insights derived from unknown/open samples.\nTo address these limitations, we formalize four distinct OWCL scenarios and\nconduct comprehensive empirical experiments to explore potential challenges in\nOWCL.

However, in real life, human learning does not follow any of\nthese techniques exclusively. The way a human learns is basically a combination\nof forward learning, backward propagation and cooperation. Humans start\nlearning a new concept by themselves and try to refine their understanding\nhierarchically during which they might come across several doubts. The most\ncommon approach to doubt solving is a discussion with peers, which can be\ncalled cooperation. Cooperation/discussion/knowledge sharing among peers is one\nof the most important steps of learning that humans follow. However, there\nmight still be a few doubts even after the discussion. Then the difference\nbetween the understanding of the concept and the original literature is\nidentified and minimized over several revisions. Inspired by this, the paper\nintroduces Forward-Cooperation-Backward (FCB) learning in a deep neural network\nframework mimicking the human nature of learning a new concept. A novel deep\nneural network architecture, called Multi Encoding Uni Decoding neural network\nmodel, has been designed which learns using the notion of FCB. A special\nlateral synaptic connection has also been introduced to realize cooperation.\nThe models have been justified in terms of their performance in dimension\nreduction on four popular datasets. The ability to preserve the granular\nproperties of data in low-rank embedding has been tested to justify the quality\nof dimension reduction. For downstream analyses, classification has also been\nperformed. An experimental study on convergence analysis has been performed to\nestablish the efficacy of the FCB learning strategy.",

In conjunction with this dataset, we introduce a novel MVOT\nmethod, Multi-View Integration Tracker (MITracker), to efficiently integrate\nmulti-view object features and provide stable tracking outcomes. MITracker can\ntrack any object in video frames of arbitrary length from arbitrary viewpoints.\nThe key advancements of our method over traditional single-view approaches come\nfrom two aspects: (1) MITracker transforms 2D image features into a 3D feature\nvolume and compresses it into a bird's eye view (BEV) plane, facilitating\ninter-view information fusion; (2) we propose an attention mechanism that\nleverages geometric information from fused 3D feature volume to refine the\ntracking results at each view. MITracker outperforms existing methods on the\nMVTrack and GMTD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code and\nthe new dataset will be available at\nhttps://mii-laboratory.github.io/MITracker/.",

The system consists\nof a controlled optical experiment specifically built for this purpose, which\nsatisfies the core assumptions of CRL and where the underlying causal factors\n(the inputs to the experiment) are known, providing a ground truth. We select\nmethods representative of different approaches to CRL and find that they all\nfail to recover the underlying causal factors. To understand the failure modes\nof the evaluated algorithms, we perform an ablation on the data by substituting\nthe real data-generating process with a simpler synthetic equivalent. The\nresults reveal a reproducibility problem, as most methods already fail on this\nsynthetic ablation despite its simple data-generating process. Additionally, we\nobserve that common assumptions on the mixing function are crucial for the\nperformance of some of the methods but do not hold in the real data. Our\nefforts highlight the contrast between the theoretical promise of the state of\nthe art and the challenges in its application.

    "abstract": "In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future\ntrajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of\nautonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is\ndetermined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing\nmodels primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often\nneglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes\nof human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the\ntrue intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in\nlong-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a\nCognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept,\nPerceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived\nSafety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different\ndriving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module\nthat includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk\nlevels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing\ndriver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed\nto capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of\nlong-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM,\n28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on producing\nresponses that meet human expectations and align with shared values - a process\ncoined alignment. However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the\ninherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow\nnature of the technological approaches designed to address them. Current\nalignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader\nissue of incomplete contracts, the impracticality of specifying a contract\nbetween a model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in\nLLM alignment. In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires\nincorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social,\neconomic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from\nthese domains. Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment\nframeworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment. We end our\ndiscussion by offering an alternative view on LLM alignment, framing the\nunderspecified nature of its objectives as an opportunity rather than perfect\ntheir specification. Beyond technical improvements in LLM alignment, we discuss\nthe need for participatory alignment interface designs.",

Although\nsome approaches utilize longitudinal data to track disease progression, they\nstill rely on single images to analyze current visits.

Building on this insight, we propose Graph-Driven Dynamic\nSimilarity Grouping (GDDSG), a novel method that employs graph coloring\nalgorithms to dynamically partition classes into similarity-constrained groups.\nEach group trains an isolated CIL sub-model and constructs meta-features for\nclass group identification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\neffectively addresses the issue of class order sensitivity while achieving\noptimal performance in both model accuracy and anti-forgetting capability.

With\nadvancements in multi-modal large language models, recent benchmarks tend to\nevaluate visual understanding across multiple images. However, they often\noverlook the necessity of combinatorial reasoning across multiple perceptual\ninformation. To explore the ability of advanced models to integrate multiple\nperceptual inputs for combinatorial reasoning in complex scenarios, we\nintroduce two benchmarks: Clue-Visual Question Answering (CVQA), with three\ntask types to assess visual comprehension and synthesis, and Clue of\nPassword-Visual Question Answering (CPVQA), with two task types focused on\naccurate interpretation and application of visual data. For our benchmarks, we\npresent three plug-and-play approaches: utilizing model input for reasoning,\nenhancing reasoning through minimum margin decoding with randomness generation,\nand retrieving semantically relevant visual information for effective data\nintegration. The combined results reveal current models' poor performance on\ncombinatorial reasoning benchmarks, even the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nclosed-source model achieves only 33.04% accuracy on CVQA, and drops to 7.38%\non CPVQA. Notably, our approach improves the performance of models on\ncombinatorial reasoning, with a 22.17% boost on CVQA and 9.40% on CPVQA over\nthe SOTA closed-source model, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing\ncombinatorial reasoning with multiple perceptual inputs in complex scenarios.\nThe code will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Building an agent that can mimic human behavior patterns to accomplish\nvarious open-world tasks is a long-term goal. To enable agents to effectively\nlearn behavioral patterns across diverse tasks, a key challenge lies in\nmodeling the intricate relationships among observations, actions, and language.\nTo this end, we propose Optimus-2, a novel Minecraft agent that incorporates a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for high-level planning, alongside a\nGoal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy (GOAP) for low-level control. GOAP\ncontains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships\nbetween observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts\nwith the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into\nfixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with\nopen-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively.\nMoreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)}\ndataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about\n30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along\nwith the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train\nMinecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2\nexhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and\nopen-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.

    "abstract": "We introduce SEKI, a novel large language model (LLM)-based neural\narchitecture search (NAS) method. Inspired by the chain-of-thought (CoT)\nparadigm in modern LLMs, SEKI operates in two key stages: self-evolution and\nknowledge distillation. In the self-evolution stage, LLMs initially lack\nsufficient reference examples, so we implement an iterative refinement\nmechanism that enhances architectures based on performance feedback. Over time,\nthis process accumulates a repository of high-performance architectures. In the\nknowledge distillation stage, LLMs analyze common patterns among these\narchitectures to generate new, optimized designs. Combining these two stages,\nSEKI greatly leverages the capacity of LLMs on NAS and without requiring any\ndomain-specific data. Experimental results show that SEKI achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various datasets and search spaces\nwhile requiring only 0.05 GPU-days, outperforming existing methods in both\nefficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, SEKI demonstrates strong generalization\ncapabilities, achieving SOTA-competitive results across multiple tasks.",

    "abstract": "Motor skill learning often requires experienced professionals who can provide\npersonalized instruction. Unfortunately, the availability of high-quality\ntraining can be limited for specialized tasks, such as high performance racing.\nSeveral recent works have leveraged AI-assistance to improve instruction of\ntasks ranging from rehabilitation to surgical robot tele-operation. However,\nthese works often make simplifying assumptions on the student learning process,\nand fail to model how a teacher's assistance interacts with different\nindividuals' abilities when determining optimal teaching strategies. Inspired\nby the idea of scaffolding from educational psychology, we leverage shared\nautonomy, a framework for combining user inputs with robot autonomy, to aid\nwith curriculum design. Our key insight is that the way a student's behavior\nimproves in the presence of assistance from an autonomous agent can highlight\nwhich sub-skills might be most ``learnable'' for the student, or within their\nZone of Proximal Development. We use this to design Z-COACH, a method for using\nshared autonomy to provide personalized instruction targeting interpretable\ntask sub-skills. In a user study (n=50), where we teach high performance racing\nin a simulated environment of the Thunderhill Raceway Park with the CARLA\nAutonomous Driving simulator, we show that Z-COACH helps identify which skills\neach student should first practice, leading to an overall improvement in\ndriving time, behavior, and smoothness.

Second, we introduce CONVCODEBENCH, a fast,\nstatic version of benchmark that uses pre-generated feedback logs, eliminating\nthe need for costly dynamic verbal feedback generation while maintaining strong\nSpearman's rank correlations (0.82 to 0.99) with CONVCODEWORLD. Third,\nextensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs including\nR1-Distill on CONVCODEWORLD reveal key insights: (a) LLM performance varies\nsignificantly based on the feedback provided; (b) Weaker LLMs, with sufficient\nfeedback, can outperform single-turn results of state-of-the-art LLMs without\nfeedback; (c) Training on a specific feedback combination can limit an LLM's\nability to utilize unseen combinations; (d) LLMs solve problems in fewer turns\n(high MRR) may not solve as many problems overall (high Recall), and vice\nversa.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art large language and vision models are trained over trillions\nof tokens that are aggregated from a large variety of sources. As training data\ncollections grow, manually managing the samples becomes time-consuming,\ntedious, and prone to errors. Yet recent research shows that the data mixture\nand the order in which samples are visited during training can significantly\ninfluence model accuracy. We build and present Mixtera, a data plane for\nfoundation model training that enables users to declaratively express which\ndata samples should be used in which proportion and in which order during\ntraining. Mixtera is a centralized, read-only layer that is deployed on top of\nexisting training data collections and can be declaratively queried. It\noperates independently of the filesystem structure and supports mixtures across\narbitrary properties (e.g., language, source dataset) as well as dynamic\nadjustment of the mixture based on model feedback. We experimentally evaluate\nMixtera and show that our implementation does not bottleneck training and\nscales to 256 GH200 superchips. We demonstrate how Mixtera supports recent\nadvancements in mixing strategies by implementing the proposed Adaptive Data\nOptimization (ADO) algorithm in the system and evaluating its performance\nimpact. We also explore the role of mixtures for vision-language models.",

    "abstract": "With over 500 languages in Nigeria, three languages -- Hausa, Yor\\`ub\\'a and\nIgbo -- spoken by over 175 million people, account for about 60% of the spoken\nlanguages. However, these languages are categorised as low-resource due to\ninsufficient resources to support tasks in computational linguistics. Several\nresearch efforts and initiatives have been presented, however, a coherent\nunderstanding of the state of Natural Language Processing (NLP) - from\ngrammatical formalisation to linguistic resources that support complex tasks\nsuch as language understanding and generation is lacking. This study presents\nthe first comprehensive review of advancements in low-resource NLP (LR-NLP)\nresearch across the three major Nigerian languages (NaijaNLP). We\nquantitatively assess the available linguistic resources and identify key\nchallenges. Although a growing body of literature addresses various NLP\ndownstream tasks in Hausa, Igbo, and Yor\\`ub\\'a, only about 25.1% of the\nreviewed studies contribute new linguistic resources. This finding highlights a\npersistent reliance on repurposing existing data rather than generating novel,\nhigh-quality resources. Additionally, language-specific challenges, such as the\naccurate representation of diacritics, remain under-explored. To advance\nNaijaNLP and LR-NLP more broadly, we emphasise the need for intensified efforts\nin resource enrichment, comprehensive annotation, and the development of open\ncollaborative initiatives.",

By varying both user\ninstructions and the nature of retrieved information, our approach captures the\ncomplexities of real-world applications where models must adapt to diverse user\nrequirements. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA datasets, including\nHotpotQA, DisentQA, and our newly constructed synthetic URAQ dataset, we find\nthat restricting memory usage improves robustness in adversarial retrieval\nconditions but decreases peak performance with ideal retrieval results and\nmodel family dominates behavioral differences.

This bias remained when we requested realistic depictions and was only\nmitigated when the automatic prompt revision was inhibited. Most farmed animal\nin industrialized countries are reared indoors with limited space per animal,\nwhich fail to resonate with societal values.

    "abstract": "Most techniques for explainable machine learning focus on feature\nattribution, i.e., values are assigned to the features such that their sum\nequals the prediction. Example attribution is another form of explanation that\nassigns weights to the training examples, such that their scalar product with\nthe labels equals the prediction. The latter may provide valuable complementary\ninformation to feature attribution, in particular in cases where the features\nare not easily interpretable. Current example-based explanation techniques have\ntargeted a few model types only, such as k-nearest neighbors and random\nforests. In this work, a technique for obtaining example-based explanations\nfrom deep neural networks (EBE-DNN) is proposed. The basic idea is to use the\ndeep neural network to obtain an embedding, which is employed by a k-nearest\nneighbor classifier to form a prediction; the example attribution can hence\nstraightforwardly be derived from the latter. Results from an empirical\ninvestigation show that EBE-DNN can provide highly concentrated example\nattributions, i.e., the predictions can be explained with few training\nexamples, without reducing accuracy compared to the original deep neural\nnetwork. Another important finding from the empirical investigation is that the\nchoice of layer to use for the embeddings may have a large impact on the\nresulting accuracy.",

First, it discusses the latest research on\nMLLMs, covering model innovations, benchmarks, and applications in various\nfields.

We\nargue that much of this debate is proceeding on a false premise. Specifically,\nour article challenges the prevailing academic consensus that the European\nUnion's AI regulatory framework is fundamentally rights-driven and the\ncorrelative presumption that other rights-regarding nations should therefore\nfollow Europe's lead in AI regulation. Rather than taking rights language in EU\nrules and regulations at face value, we show how EU AI regulation is the\nlogical outgrowth of a particular cultural, political, and historical context.\nWe show that although instruments like the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR) and the AI Act invoke the language of fundamental rights, these rights\nare instrumentalized - used as rhetorical cover for governance tools that\naddress systemic risks and maintain institutional stability. As such, we reject\nclaims that the EU's regulatory framework and the substance of its rules should\nbe adopted as universal imperatives and transplanted to other liberal\ndemocracies. To add weight to our argument from historical context, we conduct\na comparative analysis of AI regulation in five contested domains: data\nprivacy, cybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and misinformation. This EU-US\ncomparison shows that the EU's regulatory architecture is not meaningfully\nrights-based. Our article's key intervention in AI policy debates is not to\nsuggest that the current American regulatory model is necessarily preferable\nbut that the presumed legitimacy of the EU's AI regulatory approach must be\nabandoned.",

    "abstract": "The Vision Transformer (ViT) excels in global modeling but faces deployment\nchallenges on resource-constrained devices due to the quadratic computational\ncomplexity of its attention mechanism. To address this, we propose the\nSemantic-Aware Clustering Vision Transformer (SAC-ViT), a non-iterative\napproach to enhance ViT's computational efficiency. SAC-ViT operates in two\nstages: Early Exit (EE) and Semantic-Aware Clustering (SAC). In the EE stage,\ndownsampled input images are processed to extract global semantic information\nand generate initial inference results. If these results do not meet the EE\ntermination criteria, the information is clustered into target and non-target\ntokens. In the SAC stage, target tokens are mapped back to the original image,\ncropped, and embedded. These target tokens are then combined with reused\nnon-target tokens from the EE stage, and the attention mechanism is applied\nwithin each cluster. This two-stage design, with end-to-end optimization,\nreduces spatial redundancy and enhances computational efficiency, significantly\nboosting overall ViT performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nefficacy of SAC-ViT, reducing 62% of the FLOPs of DeiT and achieving 1.98 times\nthroughput without compromising performance.",

    "abstract": "Message passing-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great\nsuccess in many real-world applications. For a sampled mini-batch of target\nnodes, the message passing process is divided into two parts: message passing\nbetween nodes within the batch (MP-IB) and message passing from nodes outside\nthe batch to those within it (MP-OB). However, MP-OB recursively relies on\nhigher-order out-of-batch neighbors, leading to an exponentially growing\ncomputational cost with respect to the number of layers. Due to the neighbor\nexplosion, the whole message passing stores most nodes and edges on the GPU\nsuch that many GNNs are infeasible to large-scale graphs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose an accurate and fast mini-batch approach for large graph\ntransductive learning, namely topological compensation (TOP), which obtains the\noutputs of the whole message passing solely through MP-IB, without the costly\nMP-OB. The major pillar of TOP is a novel concept of message invariance, which\ndefines message-invariant transformations to convert costly MP-OB into fast\nMP-IB. This ensures that the modified MP-IB has the same output as the whole\nmessage passing. Experiments demonstrate that TOP is significantly faster than\nexisting mini-batch methods by order of magnitude on vast graphs (millions of\nnodes and billions of edges) with limited accuracy degradation.",

    "abstract": "Active learning (AL), which iteratively queries the most informative examples\nfrom a large pool of unlabeled candidates for model training, faces significant\nchallenges in the presence of open-set classes. Existing methods either\nprioritize query examples likely to belong to known classes, indicating low\nepistemic uncertainty (EU), or focus on querying those with highly uncertain\npredictions, reflecting high aleatoric uncertainty (AU). However, they both\nyield suboptimal performance, as low EU corresponds to limited useful\ninformation, and closed-set AU metrics for unknown class examples are less\nmeaningful. In this paper, we propose an Energy-based Active Open-set\nAnnotation (EAOA) framework, which effectively integrates EU and AU to achieve\nsuperior performance. EAOA features a $(C+1)$-class detector and a target\nclassifier, incorporating an energy-based EU measure and a margin-based energy\nloss designed for the detector, alongside an energy-based AU measure for the\ntarget classifier. Another crucial component is the target-driven adaptive\nsampling strategy. It first forms a smaller candidate set with low EU scores to\nensure closed-set properties, making AU metrics meaningful. Subsequently,\nexamples with high AU scores are queried to form the final query set, with the\ncandidate set size adjusted adaptively. Extensive experiments show that EAOA\nachieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high query precision\nand low training overhead.

    "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning methodologies\nsuch as BERT, FinBERT and ULMFiT for sentiment analysis of earnings call\ntranscripts. The objective is to investigate how Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) can be leveraged to extract sentiment from large-scale financial\ntranscripts, thereby aiding in more informed investment decisions and risk\nmanagement strategies. We examine the strengths and limitations of each model\nin the context of financial sentiment analysis, focusing on data preprocessing\nrequirements, computational efficiency, and model optimization. Through\nrigorous experimentation, we evaluate their performance using key metrics,\nincluding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we discuss\npotential enhancements to improve the effectiveness of these models in\nfinancial text analysis, providing insights into their applicability for\nreal-world financial decision-making.",

    "abstract": "While solving complex manipulation tasks, manipulation policies often need to\nlearn a set of diverse skills to accomplish these tasks. The set of skills is\noften quite multimodal - each one may have a quite distinct distribution of\nactions and states. Standard deep policy-learning algorithms often model\npolicies as deep neural networks with a single output head (deterministic or\nstochastic). This structure requires the network to learn to switch between\nmodes internally, which can lead to lower sample efficiency and poor\nperformance. In this paper we explore a simple structure which is conducive to\nskill learning required for so many of the manipulation tasks. Specifically, we\npropose a policy architecture that sequentially executes different action heads\nfor fixed durations, enabling the learning of primitive skills such as reaching\nand grasping. Our empirical evaluation on the Metaworld tasks reveals that this\nsimple structure outperforms standard policy learning methods, highlighting its\npotential for improved skill acquisition.",

While employing\nnumerous sensors with high-frequency sampling rates usually improves the\nresults, it often leads to data inefficiency and unnecessary expansion of the\nANN, posing a challenge for their practical deployment on edge devices.\nAddressing these issues, our work introduces a pragmatic framework for\ndata-efficient utilization in HAR tasks, considering the optimization of both\nsensor modalities and sampling rate simultaneously. Central to our approach are\nthe designed trainable parameters, termed 'Weight Scores,' which assess the\nsignificance of each sensor modality and sampling rate during the training\nphase. These scores guide the sensor modalities and sampling rate selection.\nThe pruning method allows users to make a trade-off between computational\nbudgets and performance by selecting the sensor modalities and sampling rates\naccording to the weight score ranking. We tested our framework's effectiveness\nin optimizing sensor modality and sampling rate selection using three public\nHAR benchmark datasets. The results show that the sensor and sampling rate\ncombination selected via CoSS achieves similar classification performance to\nconfigurations using the highest sampling rate with all sensors but at a\nreduced hardware cost.",

Current SSL methods leverage Data-Augmentations\n(DA) for generating positive samples and incorporate prior knowledge - an\nincorrect, or too weak DA will drastically reduce the quality of the learned\nrepresentation. GPS-SSL proposes instead to design a metric space where\nEuclidean distances become a meaningful proxy for semantic relationship. In\nthat space, it is now possible to generate positive samples from nearest\nneighbor sampling. Any prior knowledge can now be embedded into that metric\nspace independently from the employed DA. From its simplicity, GPS-SSL is\napplicable to any SSL method, e.g. SimCLR or BYOL. A key benefit of GPS-SSL is\nin reducing the pressure in tailoring strong DAs. For example GPS-SSL reaches\n85.58% on Cifar10 with weak DA while the baseline only reaches 37.51%. We\ntherefore move a step forward towards the goal of making SSL less reliant on\nDA. We also show that even when using strong DAs, GPS-SSL outperforms the\nbaselines on under-studied domains. We evaluate GPS-SSL along with multiple\nbaseline SSL methods on numerous downstream datasets from different domains\nwhen the models use strong or minimal data augmentations. We hope that GPS-SSL\nwill open new avenues in studying how to inject a priori knowledge into SSL in\na principled manner.",

    "abstract": "Visual reasoning is dominated by end-to-end neural networks scaled to\nbillions of model parameters and training examples. However, even the largest\nmodels struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained\nspatial and temporal reasoning, and counting. Visual reasoning with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these\nlimitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set\nof (visual) tools. Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks\nsuch as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video\ntemporal reasoning. Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily\nrely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often\ndataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled\nprogrammers. In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues\nby introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a\nsmall number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples,\nthereby avoiding human-created in-context examples. On a number of visual\nreasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in\nperformance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need\nfor human engineering of in-context examples.",

While increasing data availability and innovation in\nhigh-performance hardware fuels the training of sophisticated models, it also\nfosters the fading perception of energy consumption and carbon emission.\nTherefore, the goal of this work is to raise awareness about the energy impact\nof general training parameters and processes, from learning rate over batch\nsize to knowledge transfer. Multiple setups with different hyperparameter\nconfigurations are evaluated on three different hardware systems. Among many\nresults, we have found out that even with the same model and hardware to reach\nthe same accuracy, improperly set training hyperparameters consume up to 5\ntimes the energy of the optimal setup. We also extensively examined the\nenergy-saving benefits of learning paradigms including recycling knowledge\nthrough pretraining and sharing knowledge through multitask training.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental (and largely open) challenge in sequential decision-making is\ndealing with non-stationary environments, where exogenous environmental\nconditions change over time. Such problems are traditionally modeled as\nnon-stationary Markov decision processes (NSMDP). However, existing approaches\nfor decision-making in NSMDPs have two major shortcomings: first, they assume\nthat the updated environmental dynamics at the current time are known (although\nfuture dynamics can change); and second, planning is largely pessimistic, i.e.,\nthe agent acts ``safely'' to account for the non-stationary evolution of the\nenvironment. We argue that both these assumptions are invalid in practice --\nupdated environmental conditions are rarely known, and as the agent interacts\nwith the environment, it can learn about the updated dynamics and avoid being\npessimistic, at least in states whose dynamics it is confident about. We\npresent a heuristic search algorithm called \\textit{Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (ADA-MCTS)} that addresses these challenges. We show that the agent can\nlearn the updated dynamics of the environment over time and then act as it\nlearns, i.e., if the agent is in a region of the state space about which it has\nupdated knowledge, it can avoid being pessimistic. To quantify ``updated\nknowledge,'' we disintegrate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the\nagent's updated belief and show how the agent can use these estimates for\ndecision-making. We compare the proposed approach with the multiple\nstate-of-the-art approaches in decision-making across multiple well-established\nopen-source problems and empirically show that our approach is faster and\nhighly adaptive without sacrificing safety.",

Our findings\nreveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating\nadvanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed\nneurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit\npolysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual\nneurons. While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts,\nour results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved\nmodel \\textit{safety}.

In particular, their effective message-passing mechanics\nmake them adept at modeling molecules and crystalline materials. However,\ncurrent geometric GNNs only offer a mean-field approximation of the many-body\nsystem, encapsulated within two-body message passing, thus falling short in\ncapturing intricate relationships within these geometric graphs. To address\nthis limitation, tensor networks, widely employed by computational physics to\nhandle manybody systems using high-order tensors, have been introduced.\nNevertheless, integrating these tensorized networks into the message-passing\nframework of GNNs faces scalability and symmetry conservation (e.g.,\npermutation and rotation) challenges.

Our\nmethod effectively models complex many-body relationships, suppressing\nmean-field approximations, and captures symmetries within geometric graphs.\nImportantly, it seamlessly replaces the standard message-passing and\nlayer-aggregation modules intrinsic to geometric GNNs.

This is a challenging, and mostly unaddressed\ntask. Existing methods leverage heuristics and regular expressions, that can be\nvery noisy, and therefore increase toil on developers. The next step -\nmodifying code itself - to automatically remediate a detection, is a complex\ntask.

This paper proposes an\nasynchronous decentralized training paradigm for large modern deep learning\nmodels that harnesses the compute power of regular heterogeneous PCs with\nlimited resources connected across the internet to achieve favourable\nperformance metrics. Ravnest facilitates decentralized training by efficiently\norganizing compute nodes into clusters with similar data transfer rates and\ncompute capabilities, without necessitating that each node hosts the entire\nmodel. These clusters engage in $\\textit{Zero-Bubble Asynchronous Model\nParallel}$ training, and a $\\textit{Parallel Multi-Ring All-Reduce}$ method is\nemployed to effectively execute global parameter averaging across all clusters.\nWe have framed our asynchronous SGD loss function as a block structured\noptimization problem with delayed updates and derived an optimal convergence\nrate of $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right)$.

Recently, automated approaches with various\nartificial intelligence approaches have provided promising results for\nmodelling and predicting student engagement and performance in collaborative\nlearning tasks. However, due to the lack of transparency and interpretability\ncaused by the use of \"black box\" approaches in learning analytics design and\nimplementation, guidance for teaching and learning practice may become a\nchallenge. On the one hand, the black box created by machine learning\nalgorithms and models prevents users from obtaining educationally meaningful\nlearning and teaching suggestions. On the other hand, focusing on group and\ncohort level analysis only can make it difficult to provide specific support\nfor individual students working in collaborative groups. This paper proposes a\ntransparent approach to automatically detect student's individual engagement in\nthe process of collaboration. The results show that the proposed approach can\nreflect student's individual engagement and can be used as an indicator to\ndistinguish students with different collaborative learning challenges\n(cognitive, behavioural and emotional) and learning outcomes.

The prevalent methods of segregating the\nad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad\nauction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual\ndisplay position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad\nallocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the\ndisplay position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC)\nfor the advertisement.

AIGCBench tackles the limitations of\nexisting benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including\na varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different\nstate-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text\ncombiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate\nimages via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation\nframework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics\nspanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are\ncontrol-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video\nquality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free,\nensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed\ncorrelates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and\nweaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive\nexperiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field.\nAIGCBench represents a significant step toward creating standardized benchmarks\nfor the broader AIGC landscape, proposing an adaptable and equitable framework\nfor future assessments of video generation tasks.

    "abstract": "The study of Graph Neural Networks has received considerable interest in the\npast few years. By extending deep learning to graph-structured data, GNNs can\nsolve a diverse set of tasks in fields including social science, chemistry, and\nmedicine. The development of GNN architectures has largely been focused on\nimproving empirical performance on tasks like node or graph classification.\nHowever, a line of recent work has instead sought to find GNN architectures\nthat have desirable theoretical properties - by studying their expressive power\nand designing architectures that maximize this expressiveness.\n  While there is no consensus on the best way to define the expressiveness of a\nGNN, it can be viewed from several well-motivated perspectives. Perhaps the\nmost natural approach is to study the universal approximation properties of\nGNNs, much in the way that this has been studied extensively for MLPs. Another\ndirection focuses on the extent to which GNNs can distinguish between different\ngraph structures, relating this to the graph isomorphism test. Besides, a GNN's\nability to compute graph properties such as graph moments has been suggested as\nanother form of expressiveness. All of these different definitions are\ncomplementary and have yielded different recommendations for GNN architecture\nchoices. In this paper, we would like to give an overview of the notion of\n\"expressive power\" of GNNs and provide some valuable insights regarding the\ndesign choices of GNNs.",

    "abstract": "Creativity serves as a cornerstone for societal progress and innovation. With\nthe rise of advanced generative AI models capable of tasks once reserved for\nhuman creativity, the study of AI's creative potential becomes imperative for\nits responsible development and application. In this paper, we prove in theory\nthat AI can be as creative as humans under the condition that it can properly\nfit the data generated by human creators. Therefore, the debate on AI's\ncreativity is reduced into the question of its ability to fit a sufficient\namount of data. To arrive at this conclusion, this paper first addresses the\ncomplexities in defining creativity by introducing a new concept called\nRelative Creativity. Rather than attempting to define creativity universally,\nwe shift the focus to whether AI can match the creative abilities of a\nhypothetical human. The methodological shift leads to a statistically\nquantifiable assessment of AI's creativity, term Statistical Creativity. This\nconcept, statistically comparing the creative abilities of AI with those of\nspecific human groups, facilitates theoretical exploration of AI's creative\npotential. Our analysis reveals that by fitting extensive conditional data\nwithout marginalizing out the generative conditions, AI can emerge as a\nhypothetical new creator. The creator possesses the same creative abilities on\npar with the human creators it was trained on. Building on theoretical\nfindings, we discuss the application in prompt-conditioned autoregressive\nmodels, providing a practical means for evaluating creative abilities of\ngenerative AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, this\nstudy provides an actionable training guideline, bridging the theoretical\nquantification of creativity with practical model training.",

    "abstract": "In the healthcare domain, summarizing medical questions posed by patients is\ncritical for improving doctor-patient interactions and medical decision-making.\nAlthough medical data has grown in complexity and quantity, the current body of\nresearch in this domain has primarily concentrated on text-based methods,\noverlooking the integration of visual cues. Also prior works in the area of\nmedical question summarisation have been limited to the English language. This\nwork introduces the task of multimodal medical question summarization for\ncodemixed input in a low-resource setting. To address this gap, we introduce\nthe Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization MMCQS dataset, which\ncombines Hindi-English codemixed medical queries with visual aids. This\nintegration enriches the representation of a patient's medical condition,\nproviding a more comprehensive perspective. We also propose a framework named\nMedSumm that leverages the power of LLMs and VLMs for this task. By utilizing\nour MMCQS dataset, we demonstrate the value of integrating visual information\nfrom images to improve the creation of medically detailed summaries. This\nmultimodal strategy not only improves healthcare decision-making but also\npromotes a deeper comprehension of patient queries, paving the way for future\nexploration in personalized and responsive medical care. Our dataset, code, and\npre-trained models will be made publicly available.",

With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), data anonymization\naugments the likelihood of covering up necessary sensitive information;\npreventing data leakage and information loss. OpenWiFi networks are vulnerable\nto any adversary who is trying to gain access or knowledge on traffic\nregardless of the knowledge possessed by data owners. The odds for discovery of\nactual traffic information is addressed by applied conditional tabular\ngenerative adversarial network (CTGAN). CTGAN yields synthetic data; which\ndisguises as actual data but fostering hidden acute information of actual data.\nIn this paper, the similarity assessment of synthetic with actual data is\nshowcased in terms of clustering algorithms followed by a comparison of\nperformance for unsupervised cluster validation metrics.

Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant\nincrease in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes\nis notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings,\nwhich are not directly conveyed through the overt text and image. In light of\nthis, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest\ndue to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In\nresponse to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity\nof various LMMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of\nsocial abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme\nbenchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes\nsuch as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing\nGOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness,\nmisogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive\nexperiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a\ndeficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of\nimplicit abuse.

Pathologically,\nthyroid tumors pose diagnostic challenges due to improper specimen sampling. In\nthis study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning\nto integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid\ntumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to\npredict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to\nextract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature\nrepresentations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for\nthe final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of\ndifferent image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the\ninformation from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image\nblocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by\nclassification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more\naccurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained\npathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin\nstaining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides.

Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address\nthis challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in\nall the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is\noften not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful\nin later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token\npropagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different\ntoken-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control\nthe reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient\ntoken utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose\na smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy\noutliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC,\nwe introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image\nstructures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present\nextensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT\nand Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

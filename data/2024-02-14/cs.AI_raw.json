    "abstract": "The extraordinary performance of large language models has not only reshaped\nthe research landscape in the field of NLP but has also demonstrated its\nexceptional applicative potential in various domains. However, the potential of\nthese models in mining relationships from graph data remains under-explored.\nGraph neural networks, as a popular research area in recent years, have\nnumerous studies on relationship mining. Yet, current cutting-edge research in\ngraph neural networks has not been effectively integrated with large language\nmodels, leading to limited efficiency and capability in graph relationship\nmining tasks. A primary challenge is the inability of LLMs to deeply exploit\nthe edge information in graphs, which is critical for understanding complex\nnode relationships. This gap limits the potential of LLMs to extract meaningful\ninsights from graph structures, limiting their applicability in more complex\ngraph-based analysis. We focus on how to utilize existing LLMs for mining and\nunderstanding relationships in graph data, applying these techniques to\nrecommendation tasks. We propose an innovative framework that combines the\nstrong contextual representation capabilities of LLMs with the relationship\nextraction and analysis functions of GNNs for mining relationships in graph\ndata. Specifically, we design a new prompt construction framework that\nintegrates relational information of graph data into natural language\nexpressions, aiding LLMs in more intuitively grasping the connectivity\ninformation within graph data. Additionally, we introduce graph relationship\nunderstanding and analysis functions into LLMs to enhance their focus on\nconnectivity information in graph data. Our evaluation on real-world datasets\ndemonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in\ngraph data.",

By focusing on\n``implicitly adversarial'' prompts (those that trigger T2I models to generate\nunsafe images for non-obvious reasons), we isolate a set of difficult safety\nissues that human creativity is well-suited to uncover. To this end, we built\nthe Adversarial Nibbler Challenge, a red-teaming methodology for crowdsourcing\na diverse set of implicitly adversarial prompts.

The challenge is run in\nconsecutive rounds to enable a sustained discovery and analysis of safety\npitfalls in T2I models.\n  In this paper, we present an in-depth account of our methodology, a\nsystematic study of novel attack strategies and discussion of safety failures\nrevealed by challenge participants.

The\nfirst challenge round resulted in over 10k prompt-image pairs with machine\nannotations for safety. A subset of 1.5k samples contains rich human\nannotations of harm types and attack styles.

Nonetheless, the prevalence of large-scale web graphs in\nreal applications poses significant challenges to storage, computational\ncapacity and graph model design. Despite numerous studies to enhance the\nscalability of graph models, a noticeable gap remains between academic research\nand practical web graph mining applications. One major cause is that in most\nindustrial scenarios, only a small part of nodes in a web graph are actually\nrequired to be analyzed, where we term these nodes as target nodes, while\nothers as background nodes. In this paper, we argue that properly fetching and\ncondensing the background nodes from massive web graph data might be a more\neconomical shortcut to tackle the obstacles fundamentally. To this end, we make\nthe first attempt to study the problem of massive background nodes compression\nfor target nodes classification.

Followingthis, we propose a novel Graph-Skeleton1 model,\nwhich properly fetches the background nodes, and further condenses the semantic\nand topological information of background nodes within similar\ntarget-background local structures. Extensive experiments on various web graph\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\nIn particular, for MAG240M dataset with 0.24 billion nodes, our generated\nskeleton graph achieves highly comparable performance while only containing\n1.8% nodes of the original graph.",

This\npaper pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation\nmodels in urban outdoor environments, a critical area given the technology's\nwidespread application in autonomous driving, logistics, and emergency\nservices. Specifically, we introduce a novel Navigational Prompt Suffix (NPS)\nAttack that manipulates LLM-based navigation models by appending\ngradient-derived suffixes to the original navigational prompt, leading to\nincorrect actions.

    "abstract": "For small privacy parameter $\\epsilon$, $\\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP)\nprovides a strong worst-case guarantee that no membership inference attack\n(MIA) can succeed at determining whether a person's data was used to train a\nmachine learning model. The guarantee of DP is worst-case because: a) it holds\neven if the attacker already knows the records of all but one person in the\ndata set; and b) it holds uniformly over all data sets. In practical\napplications, such a worst-case guarantee may be overkill: practical attackers\nmay lack exact knowledge of (nearly all of) the private data, and our data set\nmight be easier to defend, in some sense, than the worst-case data set. Such\nconsiderations have motivated the industrial deployment of DP models with large\nprivacy parameter (e.g. $\\epsilon \\geq 7$), and it has been observed\nempirically that DP with large $\\epsilon$ can successfully defend against\nstate-of-the-art MIAs. Existing DP theory cannot explain these empirical\nfindings: e.g., the theoretical privacy guarantees of $\\epsilon \\geq 7$ are\nessentially vacuous. In this paper, we aim to close this gap between theory and\npractice and understand why a large DP parameter can prevent practical MIAs. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a new privacy notion called practical\nmembership privacy (PMP). PMP models a practical attacker's uncertainty about\nthe contents of the private data. The PMP parameter has a natural\ninterpretation in terms of the success rate of a practical MIA on a given data\nset. We quantitatively analyze the PMP parameter of two fundamental DP\nmechanisms: the exponential mechanism and Gaussian mechanism. Our analysis\nreveals that a large DP parameter often translates into a much smaller PMP\nparameter, which guarantees strong privacy against practical MIAs. Using our\nfindings, we offer principled guidance for practitioners in choosing the DP\nparameter.",

The key feature of our evaluation benchmark\nlies in its interactive evaluation protocol -- for example, in DFS, the\navailability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's\ntraversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively\nremember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves. We comprehensively\nbuild AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search,\ndepth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential\nreasoning ability of 12 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several\ninteresting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally\nshow strong sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming\nopen-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing interactive examples may inadvertently\nhurt few-shot performance. (3) A very limited number of predecessor steps\nfollowing the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance.\n(4) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always\nsignificant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend.

In this paper, inspired by the\nsuccess of active learning, we address this problem by proposing\nquery-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a\ncontextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal\npolicy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\\tilde{O}(d^2/\\Delta)$\ninstance-dependent regret bound and an $\\tilde{O}(d^2/\\Delta^2)$ query\ncomplexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\\Delta$ is the\nsub-optimality gap over all the contexts.

However, the\nQoE models used by these ABR algorithms do not take into account that a large\nportion of live video streaming clients use mobile devices where a higher\nbitrate does not necessarily translate into higher perceived quality. Ignoring\nperceived quality results in playing videos at higher bitrates without a\nsignificant increase in perceptual video quality and becomes a burden for\nbattery-constrained mobile devices due to higher energy consumption. In this\npaper, we propose LL-GABR, a deep reinforcement learning approach that models\nthe QoE using perceived video quality instead of bitrate and uses energy\nconsumption along with other metrics like latency, rebuffering events, and\nsmoothness. LL-GABR makes no assumptions about the underlying video,\nenvironment, or network settings and can operate flexibly on different video\ntitles, each having a different bitrate encoding ladder without additional\nre-training, unlike existing learning-based ABRs. Trace-driven experimental\nresults show that LL-GABR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by up to\n44% in terms of perceptual QoE and a 73% increase in energy efficiency as a\nresult of reducing net energy consumption by 11%.",

    "abstract": "Rib fractures are a common and potentially severe injury that can be\nchallenging and labor-intensive to detect in CT scans. While there have been\nefforts to address this field, the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and\nevaluation benchmarks has hindered the development and validation of deep\nlearning algorithms. To address this issue, the RibFrac Challenge was\nintroduced, providing a benchmark dataset of over 5,000 rib fractures from 660\nCT scans, with voxel-level instance mask annotations and diagnosis labels for\nfour clinical categories (buckle, nondisplaced, displaced, or segmental). The\nchallenge includes two tracks: a detection (instance segmentation) track\nevaluated by an FROC-style metric and a classification track evaluated by an\nF1-style metric. During the MICCAI 2020 challenge period, 243 results were\nevaluated, and seven teams were invited to participate in the challenge\nsummary. The analysis revealed that several top rib fracture detection\nsolutions achieved performance comparable or even better than human experts.\nNevertheless, the current rib fracture classification solutions are hardly\nclinically applicable, which can be an interesting area in the future. As an\nactive benchmark and research resource, the data and online evaluation of the\nRibFrac Challenge are available at the challenge website. As an independent\ncontribution, we have also extended our previous internal baseline by\nincorporating recent advancements in large-scale pretrained networks and\npoint-based rib segmentation techniques. The resulting FracNet+ demonstrates\ncompetitive performance in rib fracture detection, which lays a foundation for\nfurther research and development in AI-assisted rib fracture detection and\ndiagnosis.",

On\nthe other hand, recent works show that LLMs can maintain quality with\nsignificant sparsity/redundancy in the feedforward (FFN) layers by\nappropriately training the model to operate on a top-$k$ fraction of\nrows/columns (where $k \\approx 0.05$), there by suggesting a way to reduce the\ntransfer of model parameters, and hence latency.

    "abstract": "Demonstrations are commonly used to speed up the learning process of Deep\nReinforcement Learning algorithms. To cope with the difficulty of accessing\nmultiple demonstrations, some algorithms have been developed to learn from a\nsingle demonstration. In particular, the Divide & Conquer Imitation Learning\nalgorithms leverage a sequential bias to learn a control policy for complex\nrobotic tasks using a single state-based demonstration. The latest version,\nDCIL-II demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency. This novel method operates\nwithin an extended Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning framework, ensuring\ncompatibility between intermediate and subsequent goals extracted from the\ndemonstration. However, a fundamental limitation arises from the assumption\nthat the system can be reset to specific states along the demonstrated\ntrajectory, confining the application to simulated systems. In response, we\nintroduce an extension called Single-Reset DCIL (SR-DCIL), designed to overcome\nthis constraint by relying on a single initial state reset rather than\nsequential resets. To address this more challenging setting, we integrate two\nmechanisms inspired by the Learning from Demonstrations literature, including a\nDemo-Buffer and Value Cloning, to guide the agent toward compatible success\nstates. In addition, we introduce Approximate Goal Switching to facilitate\ntraining to reach goals distant from the reset state. Our paper makes several\ncontributions, highlighting the importance of the reset assumption in DCIL-II,\npresenting the mechanisms of SR-DCIL variants and evaluating their performance\nin challenging robotic tasks compared to DCIL-II. In summary, this work offers\ninsights into the significance of reset assumptions in the framework of DCIL\nand proposes SR-DCIL, a first step toward a versatile algorithm capable of\nlearning control policies under a weaker reset assumption.",

Examples of such issues include: bias, inconsistencies, and\nhallucination. Although auditing the LLM for these problems is often warranted,\nsuch a process is neither easy nor accessible for most. An effective method is\nto probe the LLM using different versions of the same question. This could\nexpose inconsistencies in its knowledge or operation, indicating potential for\nbias or hallucination. However, to operationalize this auditing method at\nscale, we need an approach to create those probes reliably and automatically.\nIn this paper we propose the LLMAuditor framework which is an automatic, and\nscalable solution, where one uses a different LLM along with human-in-the-loop\n(HIL). This approach offers verifiability and transparency, while avoiding\ncircular reliance on the same LLM, and increasing scientific rigor and\ngeneralizability. Specifically, LLMAuditor includes two phases of verification\nusing humans: standardized evaluation criteria to verify responses, and a\nstructured prompt template to generate desired probes. A case study using\nquestions from the TruthfulQA dataset demonstrates that we can generate a\nreliable set of probes from one LLM that can be used to audit inconsistencies\nin a different LLM. This process is enhanced by our structured prompt template\nwith HIL, which not only boosts the reliability of our approach in auditing but\nalso yields the delivery of less hallucinated results. The novelty of our\nresearch stems from the development of a comprehensive, general-purpose\nframework that includes a HIL verified prompt template for auditing responses\ngenerated by LLMs.",

In this work, we\ntackle this problem from an information-theoretic perspective and propose a\nframework for reward modeling, namely InfoRM, by introducing a variational\ninformation bottleneck objective to filter out irrelevant information. Notably,\nwe further identify a correlation between overoptimization and outliers in the\nIB latent space of InfoRM, establishing it as a promising tool for detecting\nreward overoptimization. Inspired by this finding, we propose the Cluster\nSeparation Index (CSI), which quantifies deviations in the IB latent space, as\nan indicator of reward overoptimization to facilitate the development of online\nmitigation strategies. Extensive experiments on a wide range of settings and RM\nscales (70M, 440M, 1.4B, and 7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoRM.\nFurther analyses reveal that InfoRM's overoptimization detection mechanism is\nnot only effective but also robust across a broad range of datasets, signifying\na notable advancement in the field of RLHF.

In this demo, we introduce ``AuditLLM,'' a\nnovel tool designed to audit the performance of various LLMs in a methodical\nway. AuditLLM's primary function is to audit a given LLM by deploying multiple\nprobes derived from a single question, thus detecting any inconsistencies in\nthe model's comprehension or performance.

A certain level of inconsistency\nhas been shown to be an indicator of potential bias, hallucinations, and other\nissues. One could then use the output of AuditLLM to further investigate issues\nwith the aforementioned LLM.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on Human Preference Alignment (HPA) to\nensure the generation of safe content. Due to the heavy cost associated with\nfine-tuning, fine-tuning-free methods have emerged, typically modifying LLM\ndecoding with external auxiliary methods. However, these methods do not\nessentially enhance the LLM itself. In this paper, we rethink the derivation\nprocedures of DPO, based on which we conversely build an instant scorer using\nthe states of the LLM before and after In-context Learning (ICL). Accordingly,\nwe propose a novel approach called In-Context Direct Preference Optimization\n(ICDPO). It enables LLMs to borrow the HPA capabilities from superior LLMs with\nICL, generating well-aligned responses as estimated by the aforementioned\ninstant scorer, thereby enhancing the final performance. ICDPO can be further\nenhanced with a two-stage retriever and an upgraded scorer, both offering\nbenefits. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness, particularly in\noutperforming two fine-tuning-free baselines, and it exhibits competitiveness\nwith SFT + LoRA. We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive\ninsights into ICDPO.",

Common methodologies in partially-observable domains largely\nlean on end-to-end learning from high-dimensional observations, such as images,\nwithout explicitly reasoning about true state. We suggest an alternative\ndirection, introducing the Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL)\nframework. At the heart of PSRL is the fusion of both supervised and\nunsupervised learning. The approach leverages a state estimator to distill\nsupervised semantic state information from high-dimensional observations which\nare often fully observable at training time. This yields more interpretable\npolicies that compose state predictions with control. In parallel, it captures\nan unsupervised latent representation. These two-the semantic state and the\nlatent state-are then fused and utilized as inputs to a policy network. This\njuxtaposition offers practitioners a flexible and dynamic spectrum: from\nemphasizing supervised state information to integrating richer, latent\ninsights. Extensive experimental results indicate that by merging these dual\nrepresentations, PSRL offers a potent balance, enhancing model interpretability\nwhile preserving, and often significantly outperforming, the performance\nbenchmarks set by traditional methods in terms of reward and convergence speed.",

Our approach is substantiated by formal proofs that\nestablish its capability to maximize between-class mean distance (the concept\nof \\textit{separation}) and minimize within-class variances (the concept of\n\\textit{compactness}), which together define the two linear discriminant\nanalysis (LDA) criteria, particularly under ideal data conditions such as\nisotropy around class means and dominant leading eigenvalues.

    "abstract": "Mussel farming is one of the most important aquaculture industries. The main\nrisk to mussel farming is harmful algal blooms (HABs), which pose a risk to\nhuman consumption. In Galicia, the Spanish main producer of cultivated mussels,\nthe opening and closing of the production areas is controlled by a monitoring\nprogram. In addition to the closures resulting from the presence of toxicity\nexceeding the legal threshold, in the absence of a confirmatory sampling and\nthe existence of risk factors, precautionary closures may be applied. These\ndecisions are made by experts without the support or formalisation of the\nexperience on which they are based. Therefore, this work proposes a predictive\nmodel capable of supporting the application of precautionary closures.\nAchieving sensitivity, accuracy and kappa index values of 97.34%, 91.83% and\n0.75 respectively, the kNN algorithm has provided the best results. This allows\nthe creation of a system capable of helping in complex situations where\nforecast errors are more common.",

An essential procedure\nenabling this adoption is instruction tuning, which substantially enhances LMs'\npractical utility by training them to follow user instructions and human\npreferences. However, existing instruction tuning schemes overlook a crucial\naspect: the security of generated code. As a result, even the state-of-the-art\ninstruction-tuned LMs frequently produce unsafe code, posing significant\nsecurity risks. In this work, we introduce SafeCoder to address this gap.\nSafeCoder performs security-centric fine-tuning using a diverse and\nhigh-quality dataset that we collected using an automated pipeline. We\nintegrate the security fine-tuning with standard instruction tuning, to\nfacilitate a joint optimization of both security and utility.

Moreover, we\nutilize the universal model to conduct high-throughput calculations of\nelectronic structures for crystals in GeNOME datasets, identifying 3,940\ncrystals with direct band gaps and 5,109 crystals with flat bands.

    "abstract": "The research field of Artificial Life studies how life-like phenomena such as\nautopoiesis, agency, or self-regulation can self-organize in computer\nsimulations. In cellular automata (CA), a key open-question has been whether it\nit is possible to find environment rules that self-organize robust\n\"individuals\" from an initial state with no prior existence of things like\n\"bodies\", \"brain\", \"perception\" or \"action\". In this paper, we leverage recent\nadvances in machine learning, combining algorithms for diversity search,\ncurriculum learning and gradient descent, to automate the search of such\n\"individuals\", i.e. localized structures that move around with the ability to\nreact in a coherent manner to external obstacles and maintain their integrity,\nhence primitive forms of sensorimotor agency. We show that this approach\nenables to find systematically environmental conditions in CA leading to\nself-organization of such basic forms of agency. Through multiple experiments,\nwe show that the discovered agents have surprisingly robust capabilities to\nmove, maintain their body integrity and navigate among various obstacles. They\nalso show strong generalization abilities, with robustness to changes of scale,\nrandom updates or perturbations from the environment not seen during training.\nWe discuss how this approach opens new perspectives in AI and synthetic\nbioengineering.",

    "abstract": "Do large language models (LLMs) display rational reasoning? LLMs have been\nshown to contain human biases due to the data they have been trained on;\nwhether this is reflected in rational reasoning remains less clear. In this\npaper, we answer this question by evaluating seven language models using tasks\nfrom the cognitive psychology literature. We find that, like humans, LLMs\ndisplay irrationality in these tasks. However, the way this irrationality is\ndisplayed does not reflect that shown by humans. When incorrect answers are\ngiven by LLMs to these tasks, they are often incorrect in ways that differ from\nhuman-like biases. On top of this, the LLMs reveal an additional layer of\nirrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. Aside from the\nexperimental results, this paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by\nshowing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of\nmodels, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.",

As\ndefense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomes\nincreasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks. In this work, inspired from\nChomsky's transformational-generative grammar theory and human practices of\nindirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus on a new attack form,\ncalled Contextual Interaction Attack. We contend that the prior\ncontext\\u2014the information preceding the attack query\\u2014plays a pivotal\nrole in enabling strong Jailbreaking attacks. Specifically, we propose a first\nmulti-turn approach that leverages benign preliminary questions to interact\nwith the LLM. Due to the autoregressive nature of LLMs, which use previous\nconversation rounds as context during generation, we guide the model's\nquestion-response pair to construct a context that is semantically aligned with\nthe attack query to execute the attack. We conduct experiments on seven\ndifferent LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box\nand can also transfer across LLMs. We believe this can lead to further\ndevelopments and understanding of security in LLMs.",

In this article, after giving some\nbackground and motivating my proposal (sections 1 to 3), I explore a way to\nanswer this question that I call the \"mental-behavioral methodology\" (sections\n4 and 5). This methodology follows the following three steps: First, spell out\nwhat mental capacities are sufficient for human communication (as opposed to\ncommunication more generally). Second, spell out the experimental paradigms\nrequired to test whether a behavior exhibits these capacities. Third, apply or\nadapt these paradigms to test whether an AI displays the relevant behaviors. If\nthe first two steps are successfully completed, and if the AI passes the tests\nwith human-like results, this constitutes evidence that this AI and humans can\ngenuinely communicate. This mental-behavioral methodology has the advantage\nthat we don't need to understand the workings of black-box algorithms, such as\nstandard deep neural networks. This is comparable to the fact that we don't\nneed to understand how human brains work to know that humans can genuinely\ncommunicate. This methodology also has its disadvantages and I will discuss\nsome of them (section 6).",

An automated market maker (AMM) is a mechanism that offers to trade\naccording to some predetermined schedule; the best choice of this schedule\ndepends on the market maker's goals. The literature on the design of AMMs has\nmainly focused on prediction markets with the goal of information elicitation.\nMore recent work motivated by DeFi has focused instead on the goal of profit\nmaximization, but considering only a single type of good (traded with a\nnumeraire), including under adverse selection (Milionis et al. 2022). Optimal\nmarket making in the presence of multiple goods, including the possibility of\ncomplex bundling behavior, is not well understood. In this paper, we show that\nfinding an optimal market maker is dual to an optimal transport problem, with\nspecific geometric constraints on the transport plan in the dual. We show that\noptimal mechanisms for multiple goods and under adverse selection can take\nadvantage of bundling, both improved prices for bundled purchases and sales as\nwell as sometimes accepting payment \"in kind.\" We present conjectures of\noptimal mechanisms in additional settings which show further complex behavior.\nFrom a methodological perspective, we make essential use of the tools of\ndifferentiable economics to generate conjectures of optimal mechanisms, and\ngive a proof-of-concept for the use of such tools in guiding theoretical\ninvestigations.",

The challenging parallel\nprogramming task of generating MPI-based parallel programs has remained\nunexplored. This study first investigates the performance of state-of-the-art\nlanguage models in generating MPI-based parallel programs. Findings reveal that\nwidely used models such as GPT-3.5 and PolyCoder (specialized multi-lingual\ncode models) exhibit notable performance degradation, when generating MPI-based\nprograms compared to general-purpose programs. In contrast, domain-specific\nmodels such as MonoCoder, which are pretrained on MPI-related programming\nlanguages of C and C++, outperform larger models. Subsequently, we introduce a\ndedicated downstream task of MPI-based program generation by fine-tuning\nMonoCoder on HPCorpusMPI. We call the resulting model as MPIrigen. We propose\nan innovative preprocessing for completion only after observing the whole code,\nthus enabling better completion with a wider context. Comparative analysis\nagainst GPT-3.5 zero-shot performance, using a novel HPC-oriented evaluation\nmethod, demonstrates that MPIrigen excels in generating accurate MPI functions\nup to 0.8 accuracy in location and function predictions, and with more than 0.9\naccuracy for argument predictions. The success of this tailored solution\nunderscores the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning in optimizing\nlanguage models for parallel computing code generation, paving the way for a\nnew generation of automatic parallelization tools.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel digital twin prototype for a\nlearning-enabled self-driving vehicle. The primary objective of this digital\ntwin is to perform traffic sign recognition and lane keeping. The digital twin\narchitecture relies on co-simulation and uses the Functional Mock-up Interface\nand SystemC Transaction Level Modeling standards. The digital twin consists of\nfour clients, i) a vehicle model that is designed in Amesim tool, ii) an\nenvironment model developed in Prescan, iii) a lane-keeping controller designed\nin Robot Operating System, and iv) a perception and speed control module\ndeveloped in the formal modeling language of BIP (Behavior, Interaction,\nPriority). These clients interface with the digital twin platform,\nPAVE360-Veloce System Interconnect (PAVE360-VSI). PAVE360-VSI acts as the\nco-simulation orchestrator and is responsible for synchronization,\ninterconnection, and data exchange through a server. The server establishes\nconnections among the different clients and also ensures adherence to the\nEthernet protocol. We conclude with illustrative digital twin simulations and\nrecommendations for future work.",

Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the\nsecurity defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks primarily utilize scenario\ncamouflage techniques. However their explicitly mention of malicious intent\nwill be easily recognized and defended by LLMs. In this paper, we propose an\nindirect jailbreak attack approach, Puzzler, which can bypass the LLM's defense\nstrategy and obtain malicious response by implicitly providing LLMs with some\nclues about the original malicious query. In addition, inspired by the wisdom\nof \"When unable to attack, defend\" from Sun Tzu's Art of War, we adopt a\ndefensive stance to gather clues about the original malicious query through\nLLMs. Extensive experimental results show that Puzzler achieves a query success\nrate of 96.6% on closed-source LLMs, which is 57.9%-82.7% higher than\nbaselines. Furthermore, when tested against the state-of-the-art jailbreak\ndetection approaches, Puzzler proves to be more effective at evading detection\ncompared to baselines.",

Remote sensing is a\ncost-effective solution for the identification and monitoring of solid waste\ndisposal sites that enables broad coverage and repeated acquisitions over time.\nEarth Observation (EO) satellites, equipped with an array of sensors and\nimaging capabilities, have been providing high-resolution data for several\ndecades.

    "abstract": "The study of decoding visual neural information faces challenges in\ngeneralizing single-subject decoding models to multiple subjects, due to\nindividual differences. Moreover, the limited availability of data from a\nsingle subject has a constraining impact on model performance. Although prior\nmulti-subject decoding methods have made significant progress, they still\nsuffer from several limitations, including difficulty in extracting global\nneural response features, linear scaling of model parameters with the number of\nsubjects, and inadequate characterization of the relationship between neural\nresponses of different subjects to various stimuli. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a CLIP-guided Multi-sUbject visual neural information\nSEmantic Decoding (CLIP-MUSED) method. Our method consists of a\nTransformer-based feature extractor to effectively model global neural\nrepresentations.

Additionally, we employ representational similarity analysis (RSA)\nto guide token representation learning based on the topological relationship of\nvisual stimuli in the representation space of CLIP, enabling full\ncharacterization of the relationship between neural responses of different\nsubjects under different stimuli.

In this\npaper, we aim to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks by introducing\nSafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to generate helpful and\nharmless responses to user queries. Our insight in developing SafeDecoding is\nbased on the observation that, even though probabilities of tokens representing\nharmful contents outweigh those representing harmless responses, safety\ndisclaimers still appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by\nprobability in descending order.

We perform extensive\nexperiments on five LLMs using six state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks and four\nbenchmark datasets.

While existing weakly-supervised approaches\nleverage image-text pairs to reduce the expansive annotation cost, the lack of\nmask supervision makes it difficult for the model to locate multiple instances\nand accurately group pixels with similar semantics, significantly hampering\nversatility and performance. In this paper, we introduce Unpair-Seg, a novel\nweakly-supervised open-vocabulary segmentation framework that learns from\nunpaired image-mask and image-text pairs, which can be independently and\nefficiently collected. Unpair-Seg initially predicts a set of binary masks and\ngenerates pseudo labels by identifying confident pairs of masks and text\nentities. We then train a feature adapter to align region embeddings with text\nembeddings based on these pseudo labels, achieving open-vocabulary\nsegmentation. However, the inherent noise in the mask-entity correspondence\nposes a challenge to obtaining reliable pairs. To address this, we employ a\nvision-language large model to re-caption the input images and extract precise\nentities, and we design a multi-scale matching strategy to reduce noisy\nmask-entity pairs.

Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the\neffectiveness of intermediate steps guidance.

(2) Then, it\nprompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both\nthe problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Lastly, the framework\nutilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning\nperformance in various domains. However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we\ndiscover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the\npremises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying\ntask. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the\npremise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps.\nFor example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same\norder as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering)\ndrastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of\npremise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our\nevaluation shows that permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop\nof over 30%. In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to\nexamine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again\nobserve a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K\nbenchmark.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models to\nhuman preferences by employing a singular reward model derived from preference\ndata. However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human\npreferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we\nfirst derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF,\nthereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human\npreferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a\nmixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm\nand propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the\nEgalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human\npreferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to\ndistributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby\nhighlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present\ncomprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale\nlanguage models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach\nin the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an\naverage improvement of more than 16% in win-rates over conventional RLHF\nalgorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33%\nwithout compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the\nrobustness and fairness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation has gained increasing attention in recent years,\nwith its aim to offer tailored suggestions based on users' historical behaviors\nwithin sessions.\n  To advance this field, a variety of methods have been developed, with\nID-based approaches typically demonstrating promising performance. However,\nthese methods often face challenges with long-tail items and overlook other\nrich forms of information, notably valuable textual semantic information. To\nintegrate text information, various methods have been introduced, mostly\nfollowing a naive fusion framework. Surprisingly, we observe that fusing these\ntwo modalities does not consistently outperform the best single modality by\nfollowing the naive fusion framework. Further investigation reveals an\npotential imbalance issue in naive fusion, where the ID dominates and text\nmodality is undertrained. This suggests that the unexpected observation may\nstem from naive fusion's failure to effectively balance the two modalities,\noften over-relying on the stronger ID modality. This insight suggests that\nnaive fusion might not be as effective in combining ID and text as previously\nexpected. To address this, we propose a novel alternative training strategy\nAlterRec. It separates the training of ID and text, thereby avoiding the\nimbalance issue seen in naive fusion. Additionally, AlterRec designs a novel\nstrategy to facilitate the interaction between the two modalities, enabling\nthem to mutually learn from each other and integrate the text more effectively.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AlterRec in\nsession-based recommendation.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various\ngraph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during\ninference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications,\nsuch as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent\nstudies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate\ninference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural\ninformation when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a\nSelf-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully\nintegrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first\nMLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case.\nThe key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations\nencoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs,\nthereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between\nSimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting\nSimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification,\nlink prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority\nover state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen\nnodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural\ninsights are crucial.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning aims to enhance performance on a target task by using\nknowledge from related tasks. However, when the source and target tasks are not\nclosely aligned, it can lead to reduced performance, known as negative\ntransfer. Unlike in image or text data, we find that negative transfer could\ncommonly occur in graph-structured data, even when source and target graphs\nhave semantic similarities. Specifically, we identify that structural\ndifferences significantly amplify the dissimilarities in the node embeddings\nacross graphs. To mitigate this, we bring a new insight in this paper: for\nsemantically similar graphs, although structural differences lead to\nsignificant distribution shift in node embeddings, their impact on subgraph\nembeddings could be marginal. Building on this insight, we introduce Subgraph\nPooling (SP) by aggregating nodes sampled from a k-hop neighborhood and\nSubgraph Pooling++ (SP++) by a random walk, to mitigate the impact of graph\nstructural differences on knowledge transfer. We theoretically analyze the role\nof SP in reducing graph discrepancy and conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate its superiority under various settings. The proposed SP methods are\neffective yet elegant, which can be easily applied on top of any backbone Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs).

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in training Neural\nNetworks to approximate Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) for representing open\nsurfaces in the context of 3D reconstruction. However, UDFs are\nnon-differentiable at the zero level set which leads to significant errors in\ndistances and gradients, generally resulting in fragmented and discontinuous\nsurfaces. In this paper, we propose to learn a hyperbolic scaling of the\nunsigned distance field, which defines a new Eikonal problem with distinct\nboundary conditions. This allows our formulation to integrate seamlessly with\nstate-of-the-art continuously differentiable implicit neural representation\nnetworks, largely applied in the literature to represent signed distance\nfields. Our approach not only addresses the challenge of open surface\nrepresentation but also demonstrates significant improvement in reconstruction\nquality and training performance. Moreover, the unlocked field's\ndifferentiability allows the accurate computation of essential topological\nproperties such as normal directions and curvatures, pervasive in downstream\ntasks such as rendering. Through extensive experiments, we validate our\napproach across various data sets and against competitive baselines.

    "abstract": "In recent years, efforts have been made to use text information for better\nuser profiling and item characterization in recommendations. However, text\ninformation can sometimes be of low quality, hindering its effectiveness for\nreal-world applications. With knowledge and reasoning capabilities capsuled in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), utilizing LLMs emerges as a promising way for\ndescription improvement. However, existing ways of prompting LLMs with raw\ntexts ignore structured knowledge of user-item interactions, which may lead to\nhallucination problems like inconsistent description generation. To this end,\nwe propose a Graph-aware Convolutional LLM method to elicit LLMs to capture\nhigh-order relations in the user-item graph. To adapt text-based LLMs with\nstructured graphs, We use the LLM as an aggregator in graph processing,\nallowing it to understand graph-based information step by step. Specifically,\nthe LLM is required for description enhancement by exploring multi-hop\nneighbors layer by layer, thereby propagating information progressively in the\ngraph. To enable LLMs to capture large-scale graph information, we break down\nthe description task into smaller parts, which drastically reduces the context\nlength of the token input with each step. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

We found that when online, how participants determined what\ncontent to trust was shaped by emotional states, which we term \"information\nmodes.\" Our participants reflexively shifted between modes to maintain\n\"emotional equilibrium,\" and eschewed engaging literacy skills in the more\npassive modes in which they spent the most time. We found participants imported\ntrust heuristics from established online contexts into emerging ones (i.e.,\ngenAI). This led them to use ill-fitting trust heuristics, and exposed them to\nthe risk of trusting false and misleading information. While many had\nreservations about AI, prioritizing efficiency, they used genAI and habitual\nheuristics to quickly achieve goals at the expense of accuracy. We conclude\nthat literacy interventions designed to match users' distinct information modes\nwill be most effective.",

    "abstract": "Automating enterprise workflows could unlock $4 trillion/year in productivity\ngains. Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades,\nthe ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive.\nCurrent solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA),\nin which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing\na workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we\nfind that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18\nmonths), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome\nmaintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such\nas GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation\ngiven their generalized reasoning and planning abilities. To study these\ncapabilities we propose ECLAIR, a system to automate enterprise workflows with\nminimal human supervision. We conduct initial experiments showing that\nmultimodal FMs can address the limitations of traditional RPA with (1)\nnear-human-level understanding of workflows (93% accuracy on a workflow\nunderstanding task) and (2) instant set-up with minimal technical barrier\n(based solely on a natural language description of a workflow, ECLAIR achieves\nend-to-end completion rates of 40%). We identify human-AI collaboration,\nvalidation, and self-improvement as open challenges, and suggest ways they can\nbe solved with data management techniques.

Recent advancements with Large Language Models have made it more\naccurate and accessible than ever, allowing researchers to classify text with\nonly a plain English prompt. However, \"sentiment\" entails a wide variety of\nconcepts depending on the domain and tools used. It has been used to mean\nemotion, opinions, market movements, or simply a general ``good-bad''\ndimension. This raises a question: What exactly are language models doing when\nprompted to label documents by sentiment? This paper first overviews how\nsentiment is defined across different contexts, highlighting that it is a\nconfounded measurement construct in that it entails multiple variables, such as\nemotional valence and opinion, without disentangling them. I then test three\nlanguage models across two data sets with prompts requesting sentiment,\nvalence, and stance classification. I find that sentiment labels most strongly\ncorrelate with valence labels. I further find that classification improves when\nresearchers more precisely specify their dimension of interest rather than\nusing the less well-defined concept of sentiment.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel two-stage active learning (AL) pipeline for\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR), combining unsupervised and supervised AL\nmethods. The first stage utilizes unsupervised AL by using x-vectors clustering\nfor diverse sample selection from unlabeled speech data, thus establishing a\nrobust initial dataset for the subsequent supervised AL. The second stage\nincorporates a supervised AL strategy, with a batch AL method specifically\ndeveloped for ASR, aimed at selecting diverse and informative batches of\nsamples. Here, sample diversity is also achieved using x-vectors clustering,\nwhile the most informative samples are identified using a Bayesian AL method\ntailored for ASR with an adaptation of Monte Carlo dropout to approximate\nBayesian inference. This approach enables precise uncertainty estimation,\nthereby enhancing ASR model training with significantly reduced data\nrequirements. Our method has shown superior performance compared to competing\nmethods on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and OOD test sets, demonstrating that\nstrategic sample selection and innovative Bayesian modeling can substantially\noptimize both labeling effort and data utilization in deep learning-based ASR\napplications.",

Symbolic Constrained\nLearning and Knowledge Distillation techniques have shown promising results in\nthis area, by embedding and extracting knowledge, as well as providing logical\nconstraints during neural network training. Although many frameworks exist to\ndate, through an integration of logic and information geometry, we provide a\nconstruction and theoretical framework for these tasks that generalize many\napproaches. We propose a loss-based method that embeds knowledge-enforces\nlogical constraints-into a machine learning model that outputs probability\ndistributions. This is done by constructing a distribution from the external\nknowledge/logic formula and constructing a loss function as a linear\ncombination of the original loss function with the Fisher-Rao distance or\nKullback-Leibler divergence to the constraint distribution. This construction\nincludes logical constraints in the form of propositional formulas (Boolean\nvariables), formulas of a first-order language with finite variables over a\nmodel with compact domain (categorical and continuous variables), and in\ngeneral, likely applicable to any statistical model that was pretrained with\nsemantic information. We evaluate our method on a variety of learning tasks,\nincluding classification tasks with logic constraints, transferring knowledge\nfrom logic formulas, and knowledge distillation from general distributions.",

Subsequently, sequence models such as RNN, GRUs,\nand, recently, Transformers have emerged and excelled in the task of sequential\nrecommendation. This task requires understanding the sequential structure\npresent in users' historical interactions to predict the next item they may\nlike. Building upon the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a variety of\ntasks, researchers have recently explored using LLMs that are pretrained on\nvast corpora of text for sequential recommendation. To use LLMs for sequential\nrecommendation, both the history of user interactions and the model's\nprediction of the next item are expressed in text form. We propose CALRec, a\ntwo-stage LLM finetuning framework that finetunes a pretrained LLM in a\ntwo-tower fashion using a mixture of two contrastive losses and a language\nmodeling loss: the LLM is first finetuned on a data mixture from multiple\ndomains followed by another round of target domain finetuning. Our model\nsignificantly outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines (+37% in Recall@1 and\n+24% in NDCG@10) and our systematic ablation studies reveal that (i) both\nstages of finetuning are crucial, and, when combined, we achieve improved\nperformance, and (ii) contrastive alignment is effective among the target\ndomains explored in our experiments.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommender systems\n(RS) presents new challenges in understanding and evaluating their biases,\nwhich can result in unfairness or the amplification of stereotypes. Traditional\nfairness evaluations in RS primarily focus on collaborative filtering (CF)\nsettings, which may not fully capture the complexities of LLMs, as these models\noften inherit biases from large, unregulated data. This paper proposes a\nnormative framework to benchmark consumer fairness in LLM-powered recommender\nsystems (RecLLMs).\n  We critically examine how fairness norms in classical RS fall short in\naddressing the challenges posed by LLMs. We argue that this gap can lead to\narbitrary conclusions about fairness, and we propose a more structured, formal\napproach to evaluate fairness in such systems. Our experiments on the MovieLens\ndataset on consumer fairness, using in-context learning (zero-shot vs.\nfew-shot) reveal fairness deviations in age-based recommendations, particularly\nwhen additional contextual examples are introduced (ICL-2). Statistical\nsignificance tests confirm that these deviations are not random, highlighting\nthe need for robust evaluation methods.

The precision weighting mechanism posits that the brain allocates more\nattention to signals with lower precision, contributing to the cognitive\nability of human brains.

CogDPM features a precision\nestimation method based on the hierarchical sampling capabilities of diffusion\nmodels and weight the guidance with precision weights estimated by the inherent\nproperty of diffusion models. We experimentally show that the precision weights\neffectively estimate the data predictability.

    "abstract": "The Adversarial Markov Decision Process (AMDP) is a learning framework that\ndeals with unknown and varying tasks in decision-making applications like\nrobotics and recommendation systems. A major limitation of the AMDP formalism,\nhowever, is pessimistic regret analysis results in the sense that although the\ncost function can change from one episode to the next, the evolution in many\nsettings is not adversarial. To address this, we introduce and study a new\nvariant of AMDP, which aims to minimize regret while utilizing a set of cost\npredictors. For this setting, we develop a new policy search method that\nachieves a sublinear optimistic regret with high probability, that is a regret\nbound which gracefully degrades with the estimation power of the cost\npredictors. Establishing such optimistic regret bounds is nontrivial given that\n(i) as we demonstrate, the existing importance-weighted cost estimators cannot\nestablish optimistic bounds, and (ii) the feedback model of AMDP is different\n(and more realistic) than the existing optimistic online learning works. Our\nresult, in particular, hinges upon developing a novel optimistically biased\ncost estimator that leverages cost predictors and enables a high-probability\nregret analysis without imposing restrictive assumptions.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a surge in\napplications that facilitate collaboration among multiple agents, assisting\nhumans in their daily tasks. However, a significant gap remains in assessing to\nwhat extent LLM-powered applications genuinely enhance user experience and task\nexecution efficiency. This highlights the need to verify utility of LLM-powered\napplications, particularly by ensuring alignment between the application's\nfunctionality and end-user needs. We introduce AgentEval, a novel framework\ndesigned to simplify the utility verification process by automatically\nproposing a set of criteria tailored to the unique purpose of any given\napplication. This allows for a comprehensive assessment, quantifying the\nutility of an application against the suggested criteria. We present a\ncomprehensive analysis of the effectiveness and robustness of AgentEval for two\nopen source datasets including Math Problem solving and ALFWorld House-hold\nrelated tasks.

Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by\npredefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or\nunforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified\nPromptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in\nfoundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural\nlanguage prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional\npanoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in\nadaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map\nreconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are simulation models used in economics to overcome\nsome of the limitations of traditional frameworks based on general equilibrium\nassumptions. However, agents within an ABM follow predetermined 'bounded\nrational' behavioural rules which can be cumbersome to design and difficult to\njustify. Here we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) to expand the\ncapabilities of ABMs with the introduction of 'fully rational' agents that\nlearn their policy by interacting with the environment and maximising a reward\nfunction. Specifically, we propose a 'Rational macro ABM' (R-MABM) framework by\nextending a paradigmatic macro ABM from the economic literature. We show that\ngradually substituting ABM firms in the model with RL agents, trained to\nmaximise profits, allows for studying the impact of rationality on the economy.\nWe find that RL agents spontaneously learn three distinct strategies for\nmaximising profits, with the optimal strategy depending on the level of market\ncompetition and rationality. We also find that RL agents with independent\npolicies, and without the ability to communicate with each other, spontaneously\nlearn to segregate into different strategic groups, thus increasing market\npower and overall profits. Finally, we find that a higher number of rational\n(RL) agents in the economy always improves the macroeconomic environment as\nmeasured by total output. Depending on the specific rational policy, this can\ncome at the cost of higher instability. Our R-MABM framework allows for stable\nmulti-agent learning, is available in open source, and represents a principled\nand robust direction to extend economic simulators.",

A specific, though general, framework that allows anyone\nto obtain accurate uncertainty estimates is singled out and analysed. Certain\naspects and applications of the framework -- dubbed `conformal prediction' --\nare studied in detail. Whereas many approaches to uncertainty quantification\nmake strong assumptions about the data, conformal prediction is, at the time of\nwriting, the only framework that deserves the title `distribution-free'. No\nparametric assumptions have to be made and the nonparametric results also hold\nwithout having to resort to the law of large numbers in the asymptotic regime.",

Through the disruptive introduction of transformer based large\nlanguage models (LLMs) humans are not the only entity to \"understand\" and\nproduce language any more. In the present study, we have performed the first\nsteps to use LLMs as a model to understand fundamental mechanisms of language\nprocessing in neural networks, in order to make predictions and generate\nhypotheses on how the human brain does language processing. Thus, we have used\nChatGPT to generate seven different stylistic variations of ten different\nnarratives (Aesop's fables). We used these stories as input for the open source\nLLM BERT and have analyzed the activation patterns of the hidden units of BERT\nusing multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis. We found that the\nactivation vectors of the hidden units cluster according to stylistic\nvariations in earlier layers of BERT (1) than narrative content (4-5). Despite\nthe fact that BERT consists of 12 identical building blocks that are stacked\nand trained on large text corpora, the different layers perform different\ntasks. This is a very useful model of the human brain, where self-similar\nstructures, i.e. different areas of the cerebral cortex, can have different\nfunctions and are therefore well suited to processing language in a very\nefficient way. The proposed approach has the potential to open the black box of\nLLMs on the one hand, and might be a further step to unravel the neural\nprocesses underlying human language processing and cognition in general.",

However, for\nunconstrained problems, balancing the minimization of the objective function\nwith the reduction of constraint violations is challenging.

However, adversarial samples, which\nare undetectable to the human eye, pose a serious threat that can cause the\nmodel to misbehave and compromise the performance of such applications.\nAddressing the robustness of DL models has become crucial to understanding and\ndefending against adversarial attacks. In this study, we perform comprehensive\nexperiments to examine the effect of adversarial attacks and defenses on\nvarious model architectures across well-known datasets. Our research focuses on\nblack-box attacks such as SimBA, HopSkipJump, MGAAttack, and boundary attacks,\nas well as preprocessor-based defensive mechanisms, including bits squeezing,\nmedian smoothing, and JPEG filter. Experimenting with various models, our\nresults demonstrate that the level of noise needed for the attack increases as\nthe number of layers increases. Moreover, the attack success rate decreases as\nthe number of layers increases. This indicates that model complexity and\nrobustness have a significant relationship. Investigating the diversity and\nrobustness relationship, our experiments with diverse models show that having a\nlarge number of parameters does not imply higher robustness. Our experiments\nextend to show the effects of the training dataset on model robustness. Using\nvarious datasets such as ImageNet-1000, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10 are used to\nevaluate the black-box attacks. Considering the multiple dimensions of our\nanalysis, e.g., model complexity and training dataset, we examined the behavior\nof black-box attacks when models apply defenses. Our results show that applying\ndefense strategies can significantly reduce attack effectiveness. This research\nprovides in-depth analysis and insight into the robustness of DL models against\nvarious attacks, and defenses.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach to Machine Learning (ML) that focuses on\nunsupervised continuous context-dependent learning of complex patterns.\nAlthough the proposal is partly inspired by some of the current knowledge about\nthe structural and functional properties of the mammalian brain, we do not\nclaim that biological systems work in an analogous way (nor the opposite).\nBased on some properties of the cerebellar cortex and adjacent structures, a\nproposal suitable for practical problems is presented. A synthetic structure\ncapable of identifying and predicting complex temporal series will be defined\nand experimentally tested. The system relies heavily on prediction to help\nidentify and learn patterns based on previously acquired contextual knowledge.\nAs a proof of concept, the proposed system is shown to be able to learn,\nidentify and predict a remarkably complex temporal series such as human speech,\nwith no prior knowledge. From raw data, without any adaptation in the core\nalgorithm, the system is able to identify certain speech structures from a set\nof Spanish sentences. Unlike conventional ML, the proposal can learn with a\nreduced training set. Although the idea can be applied to a constrained\nproblem, such as the detection of unknown vocabulary in a speech, it could be\nused in more applications, such as vision, or (by incorporating the missing\nbiological periphery) fit into other ML techniques. Given the trivial\ncomputational primitives used, a potential hardware implementation will be\nremarkably frugal. Coincidentally, the proposed model not only conforms to a\nplausible functional framework for biological systems but may also explain many\nelusive cognitive phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Biologically, the brain does not rely on a single type of neuron that\nuniversally functions in all aspects. Instead, it acts as a sophisticated\ndesigner of task-based neurons. In this study, we address the following\nquestion: since the human brain is a task-based neuron user, can the artificial\nnetwork design go from the task-based architecture design to the task-based\nneuron design? Since methodologically there are no one-size-fits-all neurons,\ngiven the same structure, task-based neurons can enhance the feature\nrepresentation ability relative to the existing universal neurons due to the\nintrinsic inductive bias for the task. Specifically, we propose a two-step\nframework for prototyping task-based neurons. First, symbolic regression is\nused to identify optimal formulas that fit input data by utilizing base\nfunctions such as logarithmic, trigonometric, and exponential functions. We\nintroduce vectorized symbolic regression that stacks all variables in a vector\nand regularizes each input variable to perform the same computation, which can\nexpedite the regression speed, facilitate parallel computation, and avoid\noverfitting. Second, we parameterize the acquired elementary formula to make\nparameters learnable, which serves as the aggregation function of the neuron.\nThe activation functions such as ReLU and the sigmoidal functions remain the\nsame because they have proven to be good. Empirically, experimental results on\nsynthetic data, classic benchmarks, and real-world applications show that the\nproposed task-based neuron design is not only feasible but also delivers\ncompetitive performance over other state-of-the-art models.",

This topic has received comparatively\nlittle attention of late compared to risks stemming from superintelligent\nartificial general intelligence (AGI), but requires fewer assumptions about the\ncourse of technological development and is thus a nearer-future issue. ML is\nalready enabling the substitution of AWS for human soldiers in many battlefield\nroles, reducing the upfront human cost, and thus political cost, of waging\noffensive war. In the case of peer adversaries, this increases the likelihood\nof \"low intensity\" conflicts which risk escalation to broader warfare. In the\ncase of non-peer adversaries, it reduces the domestic blowback to wars of\naggression. This effect can occur regardless of other ethical issues around the\nuse of military AI such as the risk of civilian casualties, and does not\nrequire any superhuman AI capabilities. Further, the military value of AWS\nraises the specter of an AI-powered arms race and the misguided imposition of\nnational security restrictions on AI research. Our goal in this paper is to\nraise awareness among the public and ML researchers on the near-future risks\nposed by full or near-full autonomy in military technology, and we provide\nregulatory suggestions to mitigate these risks.

    "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of Actor-Critic (AC)\nalgorithms significantly lags in addressing the practical aspects of AC\nimplementations. This crucial gap needs bridging to bring the analysis in line\nwith practical implementations of AC. To address this, we advocate for\nconsidering the MMCLG criteria: \\textbf{M}ulti-layer neural network\nparametrization for actor/critic, \\textbf{M}arkovian sampling,\n\\textbf{C}ontinuous state-action spaces, the performance of the \\textbf{L}ast\niterate, and \\textbf{G}lobal optimality. These aspects are practically\nsignificant and have been largely overlooked in existing theoretical analyses\nof AC algorithms. In this work, we address these gaps by providing the first\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis of AC algorithms that encompasses all five\ncrucial practical aspects (covers MMCLG criteria). We establish global\nconvergence sample complexity bounds of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left({\\epsilon^{-3}}\\right)$. We achieve this result\nthrough our novel use of the weak gradient domination property of MDP's and our\nunique analysis of the error in critic estimation.",

This essay describes how we could go about\nconstructing a machine capable of understanding. As John Locke (1689) pointed\nout words are signs for ideas, which we can paraphrase as thoughts and\nconcepts. To understand a word is to know and be able to work with the\nunderlying concepts for which it is an indicator. Understanding between a\nspeaker and a listener occurs when the speaker casts his or her concepts into\nwords and the listener recovers approximately those same concepts. Current\nmodels rely on the listener to construct any potential meaning. The diminution\nof behaviorism as a psychological paradigm and the rise of cognitivism provide\nexamples of many experimental methods that can be used to determine whether and\nto what extent a machine might understand and to make suggestions about how\nthat understanding might be instantiated.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) need to adaptively cope with dynamic environments,\nchanging agent populations, and diverse tasks. However, most of the multi-agent\nsystems cannot easily handle them, due to the complexity of the state and task\nspace. The social impact theory regards the complex influencing factors as\nforces acting on an agent, emanating from the environment, other agents, and\nthe agent's intrinsic motivation, referring to the social force. Inspired by\nthis concept, we propose a novel gradient-based state representation for\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. To non-trivially model the social forces,\nwe further introduce a data-driven method, where we employ denoising score\nmatching to learn the social gradient fields (SocialGFs) from offline samples,\ne.g., the attractive or repulsive outcomes of each force. During interactions,\nthe agents take actions based on the multi-dimensional gradients to maximize\ntheir own rewards. In practice, we integrate SocialGFs into the widely used\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., MAPPO. The empirical\nresults reveal that SocialGFs offer four advantages for multi-agent systems: 1)\nthey can be learned without requiring online interaction, 2) they demonstrate\ntransferability across diverse tasks, 3) they facilitate credit assignment in\nchallenging reward settings, and 4) they are scalable with the increasing\nnumber of agents.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has received remarkable\nperformance in various critical disciplines, such as chemistry analysis and\nbioinformatics. Existing UGAD paradigms often adopt data augmentation\ntechniques to construct multiple views, and then employ different strategies to\nobtain representations from different views for jointly conducting UGAD.\nHowever, most previous works only considered the relationship between\nnodes/graphs from a limited receptive field, resulting in some key structure\npatterns and feature information being neglected. In addition, most existing\nmethods consider different views separately in a parallel manner, which is not\nable to explore the inter-relationship across different views directly. Thus, a\nmethod with a larger receptive field that can explore the inter-relationship\nacross different views directly is in need. In this paper, we propose a novel\nSimplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for Unsupervised Graph-level\nAnomaly Detection, namely, CVTGAD. To increase the receptive field, we\nconstruct a simplified transformer-based module, exploiting the relationship\nbetween nodes/graphs from both intra-graph and inter-graph perspectives.\nFurthermore, we design a cross-view attention mechanism to directly exploit the\nview co-occurrence between different views, bridging the inter-view gap at node\nlevel and graph level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\napply transformer and cross attention to UGAD, which realizes graph neural\nnetwork and transformer working collaboratively. Extensive experiments on 15\nreal-world datasets of 3 fields demonstrate the superiority of CVTGAD on the\nUGAD task. The code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/jindongli-Ai/CVTGAD}.",

With the\nextended models, we further examine conditions under which agents prefer honest\nefforts over dishonest behavior and the impacts of forgettable efforts.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosing language disorders associated with autism is a complex challenge,\noften hampered by the subjective nature and variability of traditional\nassessment methods. Traditional diagnostic methods not only require intensive\nhuman effort but also often result in delayed interventions due to their lack\nof speed and precision. In this study, we explored the application of ChatGPT,\na large language model, to overcome these obstacles by enhancing sensitivity\nand profiling linguistic features for autism diagnosis. This research utilizes\nChatGPT natural language processing capabilities to simplify and improve the\ndiagnostic process, focusing on identifying autism related language patterns.\nSpecifically, we compared ChatGPT performance with that of conventional\nsupervised learning models, including BERT, a model acclaimed for its\neffectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We showed that\nChatGPT substantially outperformed these models, achieving over 10% improvement\nin both sensitivity and positive predictive value, in a zero shot learning\nconfiguration. The findings underscore the model potential as a diagnostic\ntool, combining accuracy and applicability. We identified ten key features of\nautism associated language disorders across scenarios. Features such as\necholalia, pronoun reversal, and atypical language usage play a critical role\nin diagnosing ASD and informing tailored treatment plans. Together, our\nfindings advocate for adopting sophisticated AI tools like ChatGPT in clinical\nsettings to assess and diagnose developmental disorders. Our approach promises\nenhanced diagnostic precision and supports personalized medicine, potentially\ntransforming the evaluation landscape for autism and similar neurological\nconditions.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning systems have been widely used to make decisions about\nindividuals who may behave strategically to receive favorable outcomes, e.g.,\nthey may genuinely improve the true labels or manipulate observable features\ndirectly to game the system without changing labels. Although both behaviors\nhave been studied (often as two separate problems) in the literature, most\nworks assume individuals can (i) perfectly foresee the outcomes of their\nbehaviors when they best respond; (ii) change their features arbitrarily as\nlong as it is affordable, and the costs they need to pay are deterministic\nfunctions of feature changes. In this paper, we consider a different setting\nand focus on imitative strategic behaviors with unforeseeable outcomes, i.e.,\nindividuals manipulate/improve by imitating the features of those with positive\nlabels, but the induced feature changes are unforeseeable. We first propose a\nStackelberg game to model the interplay between individuals and the\ndecision-maker, under which we examine how the decision-maker's ability to\nanticipate individual behavior affects its objective function and the\nindividual's best response. We show that the objective difference between the\ntwo can be decomposed into three interpretable terms, with each representing\nthe decision-maker's preference for a certain behavior. By exploring the roles\nof each term, we theoretically illustrate how a decision-maker with adjusted\npreferences may simultaneously disincentivize manipulation, incentivize\nimprovement, and promote fairness. Such theoretical results provide a guideline\nfor decision-makers to inform better and socially responsible decisions in\npractice.",

    "abstract": "Text summarization models have typically focused on optimizing aspects of\nquality such as fluency, relevance, and coherence, particularly in the context\nof news articles. However, summarization models are increasingly being used to\nsummarize diverse sources of text, such as social media data, that encompass a\nwide demographic user base. It is thus crucial to assess not only the quality\nof the generated summaries, but also the extent to which they can fairly\nrepresent the opinions of diverse social groups. Position bias, a long-known\nissue in news summarization, has received limited attention in the context of\nsocial multi-document summarization. We deeply investigate this phenomenon by\nanalyzing the effect of group ordering in input documents when summarizing\ntweets from three distinct linguistic communities: African-American English,\nHispanic-aligned Language, and White-aligned Language. Our empirical analysis\nshows that although the textual quality of the summaries remains consistent\nregardless of the input document order, in terms of fairness, the results vary\nsignificantly depending on how the dialect groups are presented in the input\ndata. Our results suggest that position bias manifests differently in social\nmulti-document summarization, severely impacting the fairness of summarization\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Proof-oriented programs mix computational content with proofs of program\ncorrectness. However, the human effort involved in programming and proving is\nstill substantial, despite the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)\nsolvers to automate proofs in languages such as F*. Seeking to spur research on\nusing AI to automate the construction of proof-oriented programs, we curate a\ndataset of 600K lines of open-source F* programs and proofs, including software\nused in production systems ranging from Windows and Linux to Python and\nFirefox. Our dataset includes around 32K top-level F* definitions, each\nrepresenting a type-directed program and proof synthesis problem producing a\ndefinition given a formal specification expressed as an F* type. We provide a\nprogram fragment checker that queries F* to check the correctness of candidate\nsolutions. We also report on an extended version of our dataset containing a\ntotal of 940K lines of programs and proofs, with a total of 54k top-level F*\ndefinitions. We believe this is the largest corpus of SMT-assisted program\nproofs coupled with a reproducible program-fragment checker. Grounded in this\ndataset, we investigate the use of AI to synthesize programs and their proofs\nin F*, with promising results. Our main finding in that the performance of\nfine-tuned smaller language models (such as Phi-2 or StarCoder) compare\nfavorably with large language models (such as GPT-4), at a much lower\ncomputational cost. We also identify various type-based retrieval augmentation\ntechniques and find that they boost performance significantly. With detailed\nerror analysis and case studies, we identify potential strengths and weaknesses\nof models and techniques and suggest directions for future improvements.",

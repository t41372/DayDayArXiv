    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in large Language models (LLMs) have significantly\nenhanced their reasoning capabilities, driven by various strategies such as\nmulti-agent collaboration. However, unlike the well-established performance\nimprovements achieved through scaling data and model size, the scaling of\nreasoning in LLMs is more complex and can even negatively impact reasoning\nperformance, introducing new challenges in model alignment and robustness. In\nthis survey, we provide a comprehensive examination of scaling in LLM\nreasoning, categorizing it into multiple dimensions and analyzing how and to\nwhat extent different scaling strategies contribute to improving reasoning\ncapabilities. We begin by exploring scaling in input size, which enables LLMs\nto process and utilize more extensive context for improved reasoning. Next, we\nanalyze scaling in reasoning steps that improves multi-step inference and\nlogical consistency. We then examine scaling in reasoning rounds, where\niterative interactions refine reasoning outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss\nscaling in training-enabled reasoning, focusing on optimization through\niterative model improvement. Finally, we review applications of scaling across\ndomains and outline future directions for further advancing LLM reasoning. By\nsynthesizing these diverse perspectives, this survey aims to provide insights\ninto how scaling strategies fundamentally enhance the reasoning capabilities of\nLLMs and further guide the development of next-generation AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Reducing meat consumption is crucial for achieving global environmental and\nnutritional targets. Meat-Free Day (MFD) is a widely adopted strategy to\naddress this challenge by encouraging plant-based diets through the removal of\nanimal-based meals. We assessed the environmental, behavioral, and nutritional\nimpacts of MFD by implementing 67 MFDs over 18 months (once a week on a\nrandomly chosen day) across 12 cafeterias on a large university campus,\nanalyzing over 400,000 food purchases. MFD reduced on-campus food-related\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on treated days by 52.9% and contributed to\nimproved fiber (+26.9%) and cholesterol (-4.5%) consumption without altering\ncaloric intake. These nutritional benefits were, however, accompanied by a\n27.6% decrease in protein intake and a 34.2% increase in sugar consumption.\nMoreover, the increase in plant-based meals did not carry over to subsequent\ndays, as evidenced by a 3.5% rebound in animal-based meal consumption on days\nimmediately following treated days. MFD also led to a 16.8% drop in on-campus\nmeal sales on treated days.Monte Carlo simulations suggest that if 8.7% of\ndiners were to eat burgers off-campus on treated days, MFD's GHG savings would\nbe fully negated. As our analysis identifies on-campus customer retention as\nthe main challenge to MFD effectiveness, we recommend combining MFD with\ncustomer retention interventions to ensure environmental and nutritional\nbenefits.",

In this\npaper, we address both limitations by introducing Multi-Dimensional Pruning\n(MDP), a novel paradigm that jointly optimizes across a variety of pruning\ngranularities-including channels, query, key, heads, embeddings, and blocks.\nMDP employs an advanced latency modeling technique to accurately capture\nlatency variations across all prunable dimensions, achieving an optimal balance\nbetween latency and accuracy. By reformulating pruning as a Mixed-Integer\nNonlinear Program (MINLP), MDP efficiently identifies the optimal pruned\nstructure across all prunable dimensions while respecting latency constraints.\nThis versatile framework supports both CNNs and transformers. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MDP significantly outperforms previous methods,\nespecially at high pruning ratios. On ImageNet, MDP achieves a 28% speed\nincrease with a +1.4 Top-1 accuracy improvement over prior work like HALP for\nResNet50 pruning.

These systems evolve\nunder influences such as age, sex, diet, environmental exposures, and diseases,\nmaking them challenging to decode given the involvement of tens of thousands of\ngenes and proteins. Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data\nhave provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks\nwithin various cell subpopulations and conditions. Inspired by the success of\nlarge foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision\nmodels) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first\ndataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the\nsignaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information\nsuch as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key\ncontributions. First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates\nhuman-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations,\nsignaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and\nprotein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This\napproach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph\nneural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing\ndata of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions\n(healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch. This facilitates\nthe development of innovative cell signaling models that could transform\nresearch in life sciences, healthcare, and precision medicine.

    "abstract": "To reduce development overhead and enable seamless integration between\npotential components comprising any given generative AI application, the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) has recently been released and\nsubsequently widely adopted. The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API\ncalls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By\nconnecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources,\nand prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs.\nHowever, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security\nrisks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs\nmay be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system\nthrough various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access\ncontrol, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related\nattacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first\nagentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses\nseveral agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP\nserver's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and\nremediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report\ndetailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with\ngeneral-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to\naudit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment.\n  The described MCP server auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, is freely available\nat: https://github.com/johnhalloran321/mcpSafetyScanner",

Our experiments with GPT-2\ndemonstrate a fundamental trade-off between interpretability and the\ntask-performance of the trainable prompt, explicating the hardness of the soft\nprompt interpretability problem and revealing odd behavior that arises when one\noptimizes for an interpretability proxy.",

However, strict\nsafety requirements in these domains have limited the adoption of AI, since\naccurate calibration of predicted probabilities and robustness against\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data is necessary.\n  This paper proposes UAC (Uncertainty-Aware Calibration), a novel two-step\nmethod to address these challenges in IMU-based gesture recognition. First, we\npresent an uncertainty-aware gesture network architecture that predicts both\ngesture probabilities and their associated uncertainties from IMU data. This\nuncertainty is then used to calibrate the probabilities of each potential\ngesture. Second, an entropy-weighted expectation of predictions over multiple\nIMU data windows is used to improve accuracy while maintaining correct\ncalibration.\n  Our method is evaluated using three publicly available IMU datasets for\ngesture detection and is compared to three state-of-the-art calibration methods\nfor neural networks: temperature scaling, entropy maximization, and Laplace\napproximation. UAC outperforms existing methods, achieving improved accuracy\nand calibration in both OOD and in-distribution scenarios. Moreover, we find\nthat, unlike our method, none of the state-of-the-art methods significantly\nimprove the calibration of IMU-based gesture recognition models.

To investigate its impact, we conducted a\ncrowdsourcing study with 450 participants, each completing one of six\ndecision-making tasks spanning public safety, diet and health management,\nsustainability, and AI ethics. Participants engaged in a multi-prompt\nconversation with ChatGPT to address the task, allowing us to compare pre-chat\nintent-based expectations with observed interactions. We found that: 1) Several\naspects of pre-chat expectations are closely associated with users' prior\nexperiences with ChatGPT, search engines, and virtual assistants; 2) Prior\nsystem experience shapes language use and prompting behavior. Frequent ChatGPT\nusers reduced deictic terms and hedge words and frequently adjusted prompts.\nUsers with rich search experience maintained structured, less-conversational\nqueries with minimal modifications. Users of virtual assistants favored\ndirective, command-like prompts, reinforcing functional fixedness; 3) When the\nsystem failed to meet expectations, participants generated more detailed\nprompts with increased linguistic diversity, reflecting adaptive shifts. These\nfindings suggest that while preconceived expectations constrain early\ninteractions, unmet expectations can motivate behavioral adaptation.

To\novercome these limitations, we propose an end-to-end survey collection\nframework driven by conversational Large Language Models (LLMs).\n  Materials and Methods: Our framework consists of a researcher responsible for\ndesigning the survey and recruiting participants, a conversational phone agent\npowered by an LLM that calls participants and administers the survey, a second\nLLM (GPT-4o) that analyzes the conversation transcripts generated during the\nsurveys, and a database for storing and organizing the results. To test our\nframework, we recruited 8 participants consisting of 5 native and 3 non-native\nenglish speakers and administered 40 surveys. We evaluated the correctness of\nLLM-generated conversation transcripts, accuracy of survey responses inferred\nby GPT-4o and overall participant experience.\n  Results: Survey responses were successfully extracted by GPT-4o from\nconversation transcripts with an average accuracy of 98% despite transcripts\nexhibiting an average per-line word error rate of 7.7%. While participants\nnoted occasional errors made by the conversational LLM agent, they reported\nthat the agent effectively conveyed the purpose of the survey, demonstrated\ngood comprehension, and maintained an engaging interaction.\n  Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential of LLM agents in conducting\nand analyzing phone surveys for healthcare applications. By reducing the\nworkload on human interviewers and offering a scalable solution, this approach\npaves the way for real-world, end-to-end AI-powered phone survey collection\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "With the wide and cross-domain adoption of Large Language Models, it becomes\ncrucial to assess to which extent the statistical correlations in training\ndata, which underlie their impressive performance, hide subtle and potentially\ntroubling biases. Gender bias in LLMs has been widely investigated from the\nperspectives of works, hobbies, and emotions typically associated with a\nspecific gender. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective. We\ninvestigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on\nonline shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by\ngender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases\nfrom users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to\nclassify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender\nco-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with\nmoderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical\nassociations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit\ninstructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do\nnot eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent\nnature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust\nbias-mitigation strategies.",

To investigate this question, we formalize a\nframework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs). DFAs offer a formalism\nthrough which we can characterize task complexity through measurable properties\nsuch as run length (number of reasoning steps required) and state-space size\n(decision complexity). We first show that across different tasks and models of\ndifferent sizes and training paradigms, there exists an optimal amount of\nreasoning tokens such that the probability of producing a correct solution is\nmaximized. We then investigate which properties of complexity govern this\ncritical length: we find that task instances with longer corresponding\nunderlying DFA runs (i.e. demand greater latent state-tracking requirements)\ncorrelate with longer reasoning lengths, but, surprisingly, that DFA size (i.e.\nstate-space complexity) does not.

In this context, this work's main contributions are twofold: (i) we\nprovide a scientifically sound comparative analysis of the cost-benefit of\ntwelve traditional and recent ATC solutions including five open LLMs, and (ii)\na large benchmark comprising {22 datasets}, including sentiment analysis and\ntopic classification, with their (train-validation-test) partitions based on\nfolded cross-validation procedures, along with documentation, and code.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Rehabilitation Lower Extremity Robotic\nExoskeletons (RLEEX) technology, significant advancements have been made in\nHuman-Robot Interaction (HRI) methods. These include traditional physical HRI\nmethods that are easily recognizable and various bio-electrical signal-based\nHRI methods that can visualize and predict actions. However, most of these HRI\nmethods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity,\nsensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and,\nmost importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the\ninteraction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient\nmotivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nnovel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB\nmonocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps:\ndetecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby\napplying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to\ncontrol gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a\nfeasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high\nlatency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a\ngesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\\% and an average system\nresponse time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI. The proposed\nnon-contact HRI method represents a pioneering advancement in control\ninteractions for RLEEX, paving the way for further exploration and development\nin this field.",

Our methodology involves: (1) probing for planning-relevant\nconcepts, (2) investigating plan formation within the agent's representations,\nand (3) verifying that discovered plans (in the agent's representations) have a\ncausal effect on the agent's behavior through interventions. We also show that\nthe emergence of these plans coincides with the emergence of a planning-like\nproperty: the ability to benefit from additional test-time compute. Finally, we\nperform a qualitative analysis of the planning algorithm learned by the agent\nand discover a strong resemblance to parallelized bidirectional search.

To systematically assess the\nresponses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the\noutputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well\nas general-purpose and code-specific LLMs. Furthermore, we investigate the\nimpact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their\ntendency to generate harmful content.

We find that some models and\nmodel families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that\ncode-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose\ncounterparts. Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than\ntheir base-models due to their design choices.

    "abstract": "The ever-growing amount of sensor data from machines, smart devices, and the\nenvironment leads to an abundance of high-resolution, unannotated time series\n(TS). These recordings encode the recognizable properties of latent states and\ntransitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes.\nThe unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their\ntransitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). We introduce\nCLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the\npredictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised\nsetting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data\nsegments emerge from the same state or not. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a\nclassifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between\nsegments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the\nsame latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification\nquality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 391 TS from four\nbenchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states\nthan five state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime\ntradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of\nCLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.",

Recent advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have shown promising performance on ToM benchmarks, raising the\nquestion: Do these benchmarks necessitate explicit human-like reasoning\nprocesses, or can models succeed through alternative strategies? We investigate\nthis question empirically by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) and\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to LLMs of varying scales (0.5B to 7B parameters)\nand evaluating them across multiple ToM datasets. Our results reveal a\nscale-dependent impact of RL: while RL significantly improves accuracy and\nfosters high-quality, interpretable, and transferable belief-tracking reasoning\nin larger models (7B), it leads to \"reasoning collapse\" in smaller models\n($\\leq$3B), where high accuracy and generalization ability are achieved via\ndrastically shortened, less meaningful responses. Surprisingly, further SFT\nachieves competitive and generalizable performance across these benchmarks,\noften matching or exceeding RL models in accuracy, despite not being explicitly\ntrained to produce structured reasoning traces.

    "abstract": "Most papers caution against using predictive models for disease\nstratification based on unselected radiomic features, as these features are\naffected by contouring variability. Instead, they advocate for the use of the\nIntraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) as a measure of stability for feature\nselection. However, the direct effect of segmentation variability on the\npredictive models is rarely studied. This study investigates the impact of\nsegmentation variability on feature stability and predictive performance in\nradiomics-based prediction of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subtype\nusing Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A total of 244 images from the Duke dataset\nwere used, with segmentation variability introduced through modifications of\nmanual segmentations. For each mask, explainable radiomic features were\nselected using the Shapley Additive exPlanations method and used to train\nlogistic regression models. Feature stability across segmentations was assessed\nvia ICC, Pearson's correlation, and reliability scores quantifying the\nrelationship between feature stability and segmentation variability. Results\nindicate that segmentation accuracy does not significantly impact predictive\nperformance. While incorporating peritumoral information may reduce feature\nreproducibility, it does not diminish feature predictive capability. Moreover,\nfeature selection in predictive models is not inherently tied to feature\nstability with respect to segmentation, suggesting that an overreliance on ICC\nor reliability scores for feature selection might exclude valuable predictive\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across\nvarious computer vision tasks, but their high computational cost remains a\nchallenge. Token pruning has been proposed to reduce this cost by selectively\nremoving less important tokens. While effective in vision tasks by discarding\nnon-object regions, applying this technique to audio tasks presents unique\nchallenges, as distinguishing relevant from irrelevant regions in\ntime-frequency representations is less straightforward. In this study, for the\nfirst time, we applied token pruning to ViT-based audio classification models\nusing Mel-spectrograms and analyzed the trade-offs between model performance\nand computational cost: TopK token pruning can reduce MAC operations of\nAudioMAE and AST by 30-40%, with less than a 1% drop in classification\naccuracy. Our analysis reveals that while high-intensity tokens contribute\nsignificantly to model accuracy, low-intensity tokens remain important. In\nparticular, they play a more critical role in general audio classification\ntasks than in speech-specific tasks.",

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic\nsegmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions,\na comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision\nmodels under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills\nthis gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial\nrobustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to\nassess the impact of localized corruptions.

Current horizon scanning faces\nchallenges in efficient information retrieval and analysis, especially from\nunstructured sources like news, presenting a need for innovative tools.\nMethodology: The study introduces SCANAR and AIDOC, open-source Python-based\ntools designed to improve horizon scanning. SCANAR automates the retrieval and\nprocessing of news articles, offering functionalities such as de-duplication\nand unsupervised relevancy ranking. AIDOC aids filtration by leveraging AI to\nreorder textual data based on relevancy, employing neural networks for semantic\nsimilarity, and subsequently prioritizing likely relevant entries for human\nreview. Results: Twelve internal datasets from horizon scans and four external\nbenchmarking datasets were used. SCANAR improved retrieval efficiency by\nautomating processes previously dependent on manual labour. AIDOC displayed\nwork-saving potential, achieving around 62% reduction in manual review efforts\nat 95% recall. Comparative analysis with benchmarking data showed AIDOC's\nperformance was similar to existing systematic review automation tools, though\nperformance varied depending on dataset characteristics. A smaller case-study\non our news datasets shows the potential of ensembling large language models\nwithin the active-learning process for faster detection of relevant articles\nacross news datasets. Conclusion: The validation indicates that SCANAR and\nAIDOC show potential to enhance horizon scanning efficiency by streamlining\ndata retrieval and prioritisation. These tools may alleviate methodological\nlimitations and allow broader, swifter horizon scans.

    "abstract": "Causal effect identification using causal graphs is a fundamental challenge\nin causal inference. While extensive research has been conducted in this area,\nmost existing methods assume the availability of fully specified causal graphs.\nHowever, in complex domains such as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal\nknowledge is often unavailable, and only partial information about the system\nis accessible. This paper focuses on causal effect identification within\npartially specified causal graphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed\nmixed graphs (C-DMGs). These graphs provide a higher-level representation of\ncausal relationships by grouping variables into clusters, offering a more\npractical approach for handling complex systems. Unlike fully specified causal\ngraphs, C-DMGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and\ninterpretation. Furthermore, their cluster-based nature introduces new\nchallenges, as it gives rise to two distinct types of causal effects, macro\ncausal effects and micro causal effects, with different properties. In this\nwork, we focus on macro causal effects, which describe the effects of entire\nclusters on other clusters. We establish that the do-calculus is both sound and\ncomplete for identifying these effects in C-DMGs. Additionally, we provide a\ngraphical characterization of non-identifiability for macro causal effects in\nthese graphs.",

By flexibly inserting and\ncombining these alignment modules, our framework enhances the model's\nadaptability to diverse conditional generation tasks and greatly expands its\napplication range.

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) shows its great importance in\nimaging microvascular networks by providing accurate 3D imaging of blood\nvessels, but it relies upon specialized sensors and expensive devices. For this\nreason, previous works show the potential to translate the readily available 3D\nOptical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into 3D OCTA images. However,\nexisting OCTA translation methods directly learn the mapping from the OCT\ndomain to the OCTA domain in continuous and infinite space with guidance from\nonly a single view, i.e., the OCTA project map, resulting in suboptimal\nresults. To this end, we propose the multi-view Tri-alignment framework for OCT\nto OCTA 3D image translation in discrete and finite space, named MuTri. In the\nfirst stage, we pre-train two vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-\nVAE) by reconstructing 3D OCT and 3D OCTA data, providing semantic prior for\nsubsequent multi-view guidances. In the second stage, our multi-view\ntri-alignment facilitates another VQVAE model to learn the mapping from the OCT\ndomain to the OCTA domain in discrete and finite space. Specifically, a\ncontrastive-inspired semantic alignment is proposed to maximize the mutual\ninformation with the pre-trained models from OCT and OCTA views, to facilitate\ncodebook learning. Meanwhile, a vessel structure alignment is proposed to\nminimize the structure discrepancy with the pre-trained models from the OCTA\nproject map view, benefiting from learning the detailed vessel structure\ninformation. We also collect the first large-scale dataset, namely, OCTA2024,\nwhich contains a pair of OCT and OCTA volumes from 846 subjects.",

Extensive experiments on challenging long-video\nbenchmarks confirm that TimeSearch substantially surpasses previous\nstate-of-the-art, improving the accuracy from 41.8\\% to 51.5\\% on the LVBench.\nAdditionally, experiments on temporal grounding demonstrate that appropriate\nTAFR is adequate to effectively stimulate the surprising temporal grounding\nability of LVLMs in a simpler yet versatile manner, which improves mIoU on\nCharades-STA by 11.8\\%.

    "abstract": "Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general\nworld knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and\nproducts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search\nsystems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product\nretrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2)\nproduct term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system\nfrom scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While\nthe second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant\ndifference in word distribution between queries and products means that\nproduct-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries,\nleading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\nefficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM\nsignificantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative\nretrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.",

To facilitate this easy stage, we propose to use `central\nimages', simply aggregations of random samples of the sensitive dataset.\nIntuitively, although those central images do not show details, they\ndemonstrate useful characteristics of all images and only incur minimal privacy\ncosts, thus helping early-phase model training.

The compression of large language\nmodels (LLMs) offers an effective solution to reduce cost of computational\nresources. However, systematic studies on the performance of compressed LLMs in\ncomplex reasoning tasks, especially for LRMs, are lacking. Most works on\nquantization and pruning focus on preserving language modeling performance,\nwhile existing distillation works do not comprehensively benchmark student\nmodels based on reasoning difficulty or compression impact on knowledge and\nreasoning. In this paper, we benchmark compressed DeepSeek-R1 models on four\ndifferent reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences of BIG-Bench\nHard, and MuSiQue), ranging from mathematical to multihop reasoning, using\nquantization, distillation, and pruning methods. We benchmark 2.51-, 1.73-, and\n1.58-bit R1 models that adopt dynamic quantization. We also benchmark distilled\nR1 models that are based on LLaMA or Qwen and run SparseGPT on them to obtain\nvarious sparsity levels. Studying the performance and behavior of compressed\nLRMs, we report their performance scores and test-time compute (number of\ntokens spent on each question). Notably, using MuSiQue, we find that parameter\ncount has a much greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than on their\nreasoning capability, which can inform the choice of compression techniques.\nThrough our empirical analysis of test-time compute, we find that shorter model\noutputs generally achieve better performance than longer ones across several\nbenchmarks for both R1 and its compressed variants, highlighting the need for\nmore concise reasoning chains.",

    "abstract": "Developing computer vision-based rice phenotyping techniques is crucial for\nprecision field management and accelerating breeding, thereby continuously\nadvancing rice production. Among phenotyping tasks, distinguishing image\ncomponents is a key prerequisite for characterizing plant growth and\ndevelopment at the organ scale, enabling deeper insights into eco-physiological\nprocesses. However, due to the fine structure of rice organs and complex\nillumination within the canopy, this task remains highly challenging,\nunderscoring the need for a high-quality training dataset. Such datasets are\nscarce, both due to a lack of large, representative collections of rice field\nimages and the time-intensive nature of annotation. To address this gap, we\nestablished the first comprehensive multi-class rice semantic segmentation\ndataset, RiceSEG. We gathered nearly 50,000 high-resolution, ground-based\nimages from five major rice-growing countries (China, Japan, India, the\nPhilippines, and Tanzania), encompassing over 6,000 genotypes across all growth\nstages. From these original images, 3,078 representative samples were selected\nand annotated with six classes (background, green vegetation, senescent\nvegetation, panicle, weeds, and duckweed) to form the RiceSEG dataset. Notably,\nthe sub-dataset from China spans all major genotypes and rice-growing\nenvironments from the northeast to the south. Both state-of-the-art\nconvolutional neural networks and transformer-based semantic segmentation\nmodels were used as baselines. While these models perform reasonably well in\nsegmenting background and green vegetation, they face difficulties during the\nreproductive stage, when canopy structures are more complex and multiple\nclasses are involved. These findings highlight the importance of our dataset\nfor developing specialized segmentation models for rice and other crops.",

By employing a gating network to route input\ntokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the\ncorresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is\nchallenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation,\nwhich leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and\ninsufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by\nnumerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level.\nPrevious works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized\nby the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to\nstatic execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at\nruntime. In this paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a\nhigher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies: expert collaboration\nand specialization where some experts tend to activate broadly with others\n(collaborative), while others are more likely to activate only with a specific\nsubset of experts (specialized). Our experiments reveal that most experts tend\nto be overly collaborative, leading to increased communication overhead from\nrepeatedly sending tokens to different accelerators. To this end, we propose a\nnovel collaboration-constrained routing (C2R) strategy to encourage more\nspecialized expert groups, as well as to improve expert utilization, and\npresent an efficient implementation of MoE that further leverages expert\nspecialization. We achieve an average performance improvement of 0.51% and\n0.33% on LLaMA-MoE and Qwen-MoE respectively across ten downstream NLP\nbenchmarks, and reduce the all2all communication costs between GPUs, bringing\nan extra 20%-30% total running time savings on top of the existing SoTA, i.e.\nMegaBlocks.",

However, traditional CFPNs still suffer from two core\nlimitations: (1) a computational bottleneck caused by complex feature weighting\noperations, and (2) degraded boundary accuracy due to feature blurring in the\nupsampling process. To address these challenges, we propose CFMD, a novel\ncross-layer feature pyramid network that introduces two key innovations. First,\nwe design a context-aware feature aggregation module (CFLMA), which\nincorporates the state-of-the-art Mamba architecture to construct a dynamic\nweight distribution mechanism. This module adaptively adjusts feature\nimportance based on image context, significantly improving both representation\nefficiency and generalization. Second, we introduce an adaptive dynamic\nupsampling unit (CFLMD) that preserves spatial details during resolution\nrecovery. By adjusting the upsampling range dynamically and initializing with a\nbilinear strategy, the module effectively reduces feature overlap and maintains\nfine-grained boundary structures. Extensive experiments on three standard\nbenchmarks using three mainstream backbone networks demonstrate that CFMD\nachieves substantial improvements in pixel-level accuracy and boundary\nsegmentation quality, especially in complex scenes. The results validate the\neffectiveness of CFMD in jointly enhancing computational efficiency and\nsegmentation performance, highlighting its strong potential in salient object\ndetection tasks.",

    "abstract": "Transformer has recently demonstrated great potential in improving\nvision-language (VL) tracking algorithms. However, most of the existing VL\ntrackers rely on carefully designed mechanisms to perform the multi-stage\nmulti-modal fusion. Additionally, direct multi-modal fusion without alignment\nignores distribution discrepancy between modalities in feature space,\npotentially leading to suboptimal representations. In this work, we propose\nCOST, a contrastive one-stage transformer fusion framework for VL tracking,\naiming to learn semantically consistent and unified VL representations.\nSpecifically, we introduce a contrastive alignment strategy that maximizes\nmutual information (MI) between a video and its corresponding language\ndescription. This enables effective cross-modal alignment, yielding\nsemantically consistent features in the representation space. By leveraging a\nvisual-linguistic transformer, we establish an efficient multi-modal fusion and\nreasoning mechanism, empirically demonstrating that a simple stack of\ntransformer encoders effectively enables unified VL representations. Moreover,\nwe contribute a newly collected VL tracking benchmark dataset for small object\ntracking, named VL-SOT500, with bounding boxes and language descriptions. Our\ndataset comprises two challenging subsets, VL-SOT230 and VL-SOT270, dedicated\nto evaluating generic and high-speed small object tracking, respectively. Small\nobject tracking is notoriously challenging due to weak appearance and limited\nfeatures, and this dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to\nexplore the usage of language cues to enhance visual representation for small\nobject tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COST achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five existing VL tracking datasets, as well as\non our proposed VL-SOT500 dataset.

Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical\nimage segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization)\nor whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update\nsignals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches\nignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly\nsignificant for modern foundation models.

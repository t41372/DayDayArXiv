      "abstract": "Neurosymbolic AI combines the interpretability, parsimony, and explicit\nreasoning of classical symbolic approaches with the statistical learning of\ndata-driven neural approaches. Models and policies that are simultaneously\ndifferentiable and interpretable may be key enablers of this marriage. This\npaper demonstrates three pathways to implementing such models and policies in a\nreal-world reinforcement learning setting. Specifically, we study a broad class\nof neural networks that build interpretable semantics directly into their\narchitecture. We reveal and highlight both the potential and the essential\ndifficulties of combining logic, simulation, and learning. One lesson is that\nlearning benefits from continuity and differentiability, but classical logic is\ndiscrete and non-differentiable. The relaxation to real-valued, differentiable\nrepresentations presents a trade-off; the more learnable, the less\ninterpretable. Another lesson is that using logic in the context of a numerical\nsimulation involves a non-trivial mapping from raw (e.g., real-valued time\nseries) simulation data to logical predicates. Some open questions this note\nexposes include: What are the limits of rule-based controllers, and how\nlearnable are they? Do the differentiable interpretable approaches discussed\nhere scale to large, complex, uncertain systems? Can we truly achieve\ninterpretability? We highlight these and other themes across the three\napproaches.",

      "abstract": "Symbolic Regression (SR) holds great potential for uncovering underlying\nmathematical and physical relationships from observed data. However, the vast\ncombinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for\nboth online search methods and pre-trained transformer models. Additionally,\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration\nof domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions\nwith the model during the equation discovery process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive\nframework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale\ntransformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without\nrelying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to\nlearn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder,\nenabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a\nco-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates\neffective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation\ndiscovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the\nexpression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression\nto best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly\nwhen there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the\nchallenging SSDNC benchmark. Moreover, we experimentally show on real-world\ncases that its performance can be further enhanced by the interactive co-design\nmechanism, with Sym-Q achieving greater performance gains than other\nstate-of-the-art models. Our reproducible code is available at\nhttps://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/Sym-Q.",

This allows similarity relations to be established\nbetween parametric bicycle designs and text strings or reference images.\nTrained predictive models are also made public.

In 2018,\nlicenses with behaviorial-use clauses (commonly referred to as Responsible AI\nLicenses) were proposed to give developers a framework for releasing AI assets\nwhile specifying their users to mitigate negative applications. As of the end\nof 2023, on the order of 40,000 software and model repositories have adopted\nresponsible AI licenses licenses.

The Ranksum\nobtains the sentence saliency rankings corresponding to each feature in an\nunsupervised way followed by the weighted fusion of the four scores to rank the\nsentences according to their significance. The scores are generated in\ncompletely unsupervised way, and a labeled document set is required to learn\nthe fusion weights. Since we found that the fusion weights can generalize to\nother datasets, we consider the Ranksum as an unsupervised approach. To\ndetermine topic rank, we employ probabilistic topic models whereas semantic\ninformation is captured using sentence embeddings. To derive rankings using\nsentence embeddings, we utilize Siamese networks to produce abstractive\nsentence representation and then we formulate a novel strategy to arrange them\nin their order of importance. A graph-based strategy is applied to find the\nsignificant keywords and related sentence rankings in the document. We also\nformulate a sentence novelty measure based on bigrams, trigrams, and sentence\nembeddings to eliminate redundant sentences from the summary. The ranks of all\nthe sentences computed for each feature are finally fused to get the final\nscore for each sentence in the document.

A problem that arises in many of these practical\napplications is that the outcome of the feature selection algorithm is not\nstable. Thus, small variations in the data may yield very different feature\nrankings. Assessing the stability of these methods becomes an important issue\nin the previously mentioned situations. We propose an information theoretic\napproach based on the Jensen Shannon divergence to quantify this robustness.\nUnlike other stability measures, this metric is suitable for different\nalgorithm outcomes: full ranked lists, feature subsets as well as the lesser\nstudied partial ranked lists. This generalized metric quantifies the difference\namong a whole set of lists with the same size, following a probabilistic\napproach and being able to give more importance to the disagreements that\nappear at the top of the list. Moreover, it possesses desirable properties\nincluding correction for change, upper lower bounds and conditions for a\ndeterministic selection. We illustrate the use of this stability metric with\ndata generated in a fully controlled way and compare it with popular metrics\nincluding the Spearmans rank correlation and the Kunchevas index on feature\nranking and selection outcomes, respectively.

Through the NFA, the\nauthors introduce mapping with the AGOP as a general mechanism for neural\nfeature learning. However, these works do not provide a theoretical explanation\nfor this correlation or its origins. In this work, we further clarify the\nnature of this correlation, and explain its emergence. We show that this\ncorrelation is equivalent to alignment between the left singular structure of\nthe weight matrices and the newly defined pre-activation tangent features at\neach layer. We further establish that the alignment is driven by the\ninteraction of weight changes induced by SGD with the pre-activation features,\nand analyze the resulting dynamics analytically at early times in terms of\nsimple statistics of the inputs and labels. We prove the derivative alignment\noccurs almost surely in specific high dimensional settings. Finally, we\nintroduce a simple optimization rule motivated by our analysis of the centered\ncorrelation which dramatically increases the NFA correlations at any given\nlayer and improves the quality of features learned.",

      "abstract": "The large increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have\nrevolutionised the way data is processed, which added to the current trend from\ncloud to edge computing has resulted in the need for efficient and reliable\ndata processing near the data sources using energy-efficient devices. Two\nmethods based on low-cost edge-IoT architectures are proposed to implement\nlightweight Machine Learning (ML) models that estimate indoor environmental\nquality (IEQ) parameters, such as Artificial Neural Networks of Multilayer\nPerceptron type. Their implementation is based on centralised and distributed\nparallel IoT architectures, connected via wireless, which share commercial\noff-the-self modules for data acquisition and sensing, such as sensors for\ntemperature, humidity, illuminance, CO2, and other gases. The centralised\nmethod uses a Graphics Processing Unit and the Message Queuing Telemetry\nTransport protocol, but the distributed method utilises low performance\nARM-based devices and the Message Passing Interface protocol. Although multiple\nIEQ parameters are measured, the training and testing of ML models is\naccomplished with experiments focused on small temperature and illuminance\ndatasets to reduce data processing load, obtained from sudden spikes, square\nprofiles and sawteeth test cases. The results show a high estimation\nperformance with F-score and Accuracy values close to 0.95, and an almost\ntheorical Speedup with a reduction in power consumption close to 37% in the\ndistributed parallel approach. In addition, similar or slightly better\nperformance is achieved compared to equivalent IoT architectures from related\nresearch, but error reduction of 35 to 76% is accomplished with an adequate\nbalance between performance and energy efficiency.",

Given those\nshortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs\n(MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis\ngeneration followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant\nMatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets\nsourced from scientific literature where various information extraction\nchallenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information\nextraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale,\nmulti-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge.\nFinally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world\nmaterials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated\nIn-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials\nLaboratories.",

      "abstract": "One of the challenges in robotics is to enable robotic units with the\nreasoning capability that would be robust enough to execute complex tasks in\ndynamic environments. Recent advances in LLMs have positioned them as go-to\ntools for simple reasoning tasks, motivating the pioneering work of Liang et\nal. [35] that uses an LLM to translate natural language commands into low-level\nstatic execution plans for robotic units. Using LLMs inside robotics systems\nbrings their generalization to a new level, enabling zero-shot generalization\nto new tasks. This paper extends this prior work to dynamic environments. We\npropose InCoRo, a system that uses a classical robotic feedback loop composed\nof an LLM controller, a scene understanding unit, and a robot. Our system\ncontinuously analyzes the state of the environment and provides adapted\nexecution commands, enabling the robot to adjust to changing environmental\nconditions and correcting for controller errors. Our system does not require\nany iterative optimization to learn to accomplish a task as it leverages\nin-context learning with an off-the-shelf LLM model. Through an extensive\nvalidation process involving two standardized industrial robotic units -- SCARA\nand DELTA types -- we contribute knowledge about these robots, not popular in\nthe community, thereby enriching it. We highlight the generalization\ncapabilities of our system and show that (1) in-context learning in combination\nwith the current state-of-the-art LLMs is an effective way to implement a\nrobotic controller; (2) in static environments, InCoRo surpasses the prior art\nin terms of the success rate; (3) in dynamic environments, we establish new\nstate-of-the-art for the SCARA and DELTA units, respectively. This research\npaves the way towards building reliable, efficient, intelligent autonomous\nsystems that adapt to dynamic environments.",

A task is usually composite hence can be decomposed\ninto many subtasks, which compete for resources (measured by the number of\nneurons allocated to subtasks). On toy problems, we empirically find that: (1)\nThe loss of a subtask is inversely proportional to its allocated neurons. (2)\nWhen multiple subtasks are present in a composite task, the resources acquired\nby each subtask uniformly grow as models get larger, keeping the ratios of\nacquired resources constants. We hypothesize these findings to be generally\ntrue and build a model to predict neural scaling laws for general composite\ntasks, which successfully replicates the neural scaling law of Chinchilla\nmodels reported in arXiv:2203.15556.

In this piece, we propose a roadmap to\npluralistic alignment, specifically using language models as a test bed. We\nidentify and formalize three possible ways to define and operationalize\npluralism in AI systems: 1) Overton pluralistic models that present a spectrum\nof reasonable responses; 2) Steerably pluralistic models that can steer to\nreflect certain perspectives; and 3) Distributionally pluralistic models that\nare well-calibrated to a given population in distribution. We also formalize\nand discuss three possible classes of pluralistic benchmarks: 1)\nMulti-objective benchmarks, 2) Trade-off steerable benchmarks, which\nincentivize models to steer to arbitrary trade-offs, and 3) Jury-pluralistic\nbenchmarks which explicitly model diverse human ratings. We use this framework\nto argue that current alignment techniques may be fundamentally limited for\npluralistic AI; indeed, we highlight empirical evidence, both from our own\nexperiments and from other work, that standard alignment procedures might\nreduce distributional pluralism in models, motivating the need for further\nresearch on pluralistic alignment.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has driven many information and communication\ntechnology (ICT) breakthroughs. Nonetheless, the scope of ICT systems has\nexpanded far beyond AI since the Turing test proposal. Critically, recent AI\nregulation proposals adopt AI definitions affecting ICT techniques, approaches,\nand systems that are not AI. In some cases, even works from mathematics,\nstatistics, and engineering would be affected. Worryingly, AI misdefinitions\nare observed from Western societies to the Global South. In this paper, we\npropose a framework to score how validated as appropriately-defined for\nregulation (VADER) an AI definition is. Our online, publicly-available VADER\nframework scores the coverage of premises that should underlie AI definitions\nfor regulation, which aim to (i) reproduce principles observed in other\nsuccessful technology regulations, and (ii) include all AI techniques and\napproaches while excluding non-AI works. Regarding the latter, our score is\nbased on a dataset of representative AI, non-AI ICT, and non-ICT examples. We\ndemonstrate our contribution by reviewing the AI regulation proposals of key\nplayers, namely the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Brazil.\nImportantly, none of the proposals assessed achieve the appropriateness score,\nranging from a revision need to a concrete risk to ICT systems and works from\nother fields.",

This work focuses on generalizability and resolves the\ntrade-off in observed neighborhood size with a continuous information flow in\nthe whole graph. We propose a recurrent message-passing model that iterates\nwith the environment's steps and allows nodes to create a global representation\nof the graph by exchanging messages with their neighbors. Agents receive the\nresulting learned graph observations based on their location in the graph. Our\napproach can be used in a decentralized manner at runtime and in combination\nwith a reinforcement learning algorithm of choice.

Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves\nmore reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the\nreasoning results.

Traditional\ntrust prediction models rely on pairwise correlations to infer potential\nrelationships between users. However, in the real world, interactions between\nusers are usually complicated rather than pairwise only. Hypergraphs offer a\nflexible approach to modeling these complex high-order correlations (not just\npairwise connections), since hypergraphs can leverage hyperedeges to link more\nthan two nodes. However, most hypergraph-based methods are generic and cannot\nbe well applied to the trust prediction task. In this paper, we propose an\nAdaptive Hypergraph Network for Trust Prediction (AHNTP), a novel approach that\nimproves trust prediction accuracy by using higher-order correlations. AHNTP\nutilizes Motif-based PageRank to capture high-order social influence\ninformation. In addition, it constructs hypergroups from both node-level and\nstructure-level attributes to incorporate complex correlation information.\nFurthermore, AHNTP leverages adaptive hypergraph Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN) layers and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to generate comprehensive user\nembeddings, facilitating trust relationship prediction. To enhance model\ngeneralization and robustness, we introduce a novel supervised contrastive\nlearning loss for optimization.

We formulate the causal structure updating into the RL\ninteraction process with active intervention learning of the environment. To\noptimize the derived objective, we propose a framework with theoretical\nperformance guarantees that alternates between two steps: using interventions\nfor causal structure learning during exploration and using the learned causal\nstructure for policy guidance during exploitation. Due to the lack of public\nbenchmarks that allow direct intervention in the state space, we design the\nroot cause localization task in our simulated fault alarm environment and then\nempirically show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method\nagainst state-of-the-art baselines.

These models are characterized\nby their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency.\nHowever, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting\na deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we\nconcentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of\ninvariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously\ncharacterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model,\nmessage-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting\nits unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then\nprove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph\ngraph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and\nthus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we\nfurther prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph\nlearning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with\nE(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established\ninvariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness.

Despite numerous studies on accident\nprediction over the past decades, many have limitations in terms of\ngeneralizability, reproducibility, or feasibility for practical use due to\ninput data or problem formulation. To address existing shortcomings, we propose\nCrashFormer, a multi-modal architecture that utilizes comprehensive (but\nrelatively easy to obtain) inputs such as the history of accidents, weather\ninformation, map images, and demographic information. The model predicts the\nfuture risk of accidents on a reasonably acceptable cadence (i.e., every six\nhours) for a geographical location of 5.161 square kilometers. CrashFormer is\ncomposed of five components: a sequential encoder to utilize historical\naccidents and weather data, an image encoder to use map imagery data, a raw\ndata encoder to utilize demographic information, a feature fusion module for\naggregating the encoded features, and a classifier that accepts the aggregated\ndata and makes predictions accordingly.

A major challenge in ACRL is to ensure agent taking a valid action\nsatisfying constraints in each RL step. Commonly used approach of using a\nprojection layer on top of the policy network requires solving an optimization\nprogram which can result in longer training time, slow convergence, and zero\ngradient problem. To address this, first we use a normalizing flow model to\nlearn an invertible, differentiable mapping between the feasible action space\nand the support of a simple distribution on a latent variable, such as\nGaussian. Second, learning the flow model requires sampling from the feasible\naction space, which is also challenging. We develop multiple methods, based on\nHamiltonian Monte-Carlo and probabilistic sentential decision diagrams for such\naction sampling for convex and non-convex constraints. Third, we integrate the\nlearned normalizing flow with the DDPG algorithm. By design, a well-trained\nnormalizing flow will transform policy output into a valid action without\nrequiring an optimization solver. Empirically, our approach results in\nsignificantly fewer constraint violations (upto an order-of-magnitude for\nseveral instances) and is multiple times faster on a variety of continuous\ncontrol tasks.",

      "abstract": "In response to the global shift towards renewable energy resources, the\nproduction of green hydrogen through electrolysis is emerging as a promising\nsolution. Modular electrolysis plants, designed for flexibility and\nscalability, offer a dynamic response to the increasing demand for hydrogen\nwhile accommodating the fluctuations inherent in renewable energy sources.\nHowever, optimizing their operation is challenging, especially when a large\nnumber of electrolysis modules needs to be coordinated, each with potentially\ndifferent characteristics.\n  To address these challenges, this paper presents a decentralized scheduling\nmodel to optimize the operation of modular electrolysis plants using the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers. The model aims to balance hydrogen\nproduction with fluctuating demand, to minimize the marginal Levelized Cost of\nHydrogen (mLCOH), and to ensure adaptability to operational disturbances. A\ncase study validates the accuracy of the model in calculating mLCOH values\nunder nominal load conditions and demonstrates its responsiveness to dynamic\nchanges, such as electrolyzer module malfunctions and scale-up scenarios.",

Its\napplications span various domains, including transfer learning, federated\nlearning, and neural architecture search. The most popular methods for\nconstructing the synthetic data rely on matching the convergence properties of\ntraining the model with the synthetic dataset and the training dataset.\nHowever, using the empirical loss as the criterion must be thought of as\nauxiliary in the same sense that the training set is an approximate substitute\nfor the population distribution, and the latter is the data of interest. Yet\ndespite its popularity, an aspect that remains unexplored is the relationship\nof DD to its generalization, particularly across uncommon subgroups. That is,\nhow can we ensure that a model trained on the synthetic dataset performs well\nwhen faced with samples from regions with low population density? Here, the\nrepresentativeness and coverage of the dataset become salient over the\nguaranteed training error at inference. Drawing inspiration from\ndistributionally robust optimization, we introduce an algorithm that combines\nclustering with the minimization of a risk measure on the loss to conduct DD.\nWe provide a theoretical rationale for our approach and demonstrate its\neffective generalization and robustness across subgroups through numerical\nexperiments.

      "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in complex\nautonomous driving scenarios. However, DRL models inevitably bring high memory\nconsumption and computation, which hinders their wide deployment in\nresource-limited autonomous driving devices. Structured Pruning has been\nrecognized as a useful method to compress and accelerate DRL models, but it is\nstill challenging to estimate the contribution of a parameter (i.e., neuron) to\nDRL models. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic structured pruning\napproach that gradually removes a DRL model's unimportant neurons during the\ntraining stage. Our method consists of two steps, i.e. training DRL models with\na group sparse regularizer and removing unimportant neurons with a dynamic\npruning threshold. To efficiently train the DRL model with a small number of\nimportant neurons, we employ a neuron-importance group sparse regularizer. In\ncontrast to conventional regularizers, this regularizer imposes a penalty on\nredundant groups of neurons that do not significantly influence the output of\nthe DRL model. Furthermore, we design a novel structured pruning strategy to\ndynamically determine the pruning threshold and gradually remove unimportant\nneurons with a binary mask. Therefore, our method can remove not only redundant\ngroups of neurons of the DRL model but also achieve high and robust\nperformance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive\nwith existing DRL pruning methods on discrete control environments (i.e.,\nCartPole-v1 and LunarLander-v2) and MuJoCo continuous environments (i.e.,\nHopper-v3 and Walker2D-v3). Specifically, our method effectively compresses\n$93\\%$ neurons and $96\\%$ weights of the DRL model in four challenging DRL\nenvironments with slight accuracy degradation.",

Still, while these\napproaches markedly improve models' adversarial robustness, models remain\nhighly susceptible to adversarial examples. Identifying that, in certain\ndomains such as traffic-sign recognition, objects are implemented per standards\nspecifying how artifacts (e.g., signs) should be designed, we propose a novel\napproach for improving adversarial robustness. Specifically, we offer a method\nto redefine standards, making minor changes to existing ones, to defend against\nadversarial examples.

We evaluated our approach in the domain of traffic-sign recognition,\nallowing it to alter traffic-sign pictograms (i.e., symbols within the signs)\nand their colors.

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning is becoming widely used for leveraging the power of pre-trained\nfoundation models in new downstream tasks. While there are many successes of\nfine-tuning on various tasks, recent studies have observed challenges in the\ngeneralization of fine-tuned models to unseen distributions (i.e.,\nout-of-distribution; OOD). To improve OOD generalization, some previous studies\nidentify the limitations of fine-tuning data and regulate fine-tuning to\npreserve the general representation learned from pre-training data. However,\npotential limitations in the pre-training data and models are often ignored. In\nthis paper, we contend that overly relying on the pre-trained representation\nmay hinder fine-tuning from learning essential representations for downstream\ntasks and thus hurt its OOD generalization. It can be especially catastrophic\nwhen new tasks are from different (sub)domains compared to pre-training data.\nTo address the issues in both pre-training and fine-tuning data, we propose a\nnovel generalizable fine-tuning method LEVI (Layer-wise Ensemble of different\nVIews), where the pre-trained model is adaptively ensembled layer-wise with a\nsmall task-specific model, while preserving its efficiencies. By combining two\ncomplementing models, LEVI effectively suppresses problematic features in both\nthe fine-tuning data and pre-trained model and preserves useful features for\nnew tasks. Broad experiments with large language and vision models show that\nLEVI greatly improves fine-tuning generalization via emphasizing different\nviews from fine-tuning data and pre-trained features.",

However,\nexisting LLMs, pre-trained on sequences with a restricted maximum length,\ncannot process longer sequences due to the out-of-domain and distraction\nissues. Common solutions often involve continual pre-training on longer\nsequences, which will introduce expensive computational overhead and\nuncontrollable change in model capabilities. In this paper, we unveil the\nintrinsic capacity of LLMs for understanding extremely long sequences without\nany fine-tuning. To this end, we introduce a training-free memory-based method,\nInfLLM. Specifically, InfLLM stores distant contexts into additional memory\nunits and employs an efficient mechanism to lookup token-relevant units for\nattention computation. Thereby, InfLLM allows LLMs to efficiently process long\nsequences with a limited context window and well capture long-distance\ndependencies. Without any training, InfLLM enables LLMs that are pre-trained on\nsequences consisting of a few thousand tokens to achieve comparable performance\nwith competitive baselines that continually train these LLMs on long sequences.\nEven when the sequence length is scaled to $1,024$K, InfLLM still effectively\ncaptures long-distance dependencies.

Extensive\nexperiments on six datasets across two reasoning tasks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method.

We evaluate JEANIE on skeletal Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR), where\nmatching well temporal blocks (temporal chunks that make up a sequence) of\nsupport-query sequence pairs (by factoring out nuisance variations) is\nessential due to limited samples of novel classes. Given a query sequence, we\ncreate its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a support\nsequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popular\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can be\nmatched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporal\nindex, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpoint\nwarping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths with\ndifferent temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which only\nperforms temporal alignment. We also propose an unsupervised FSAR akin to\nclustering of sequences with JEANIE as a distance measure.

      "abstract": "Algorithms designed for addressing typical supervised classification problems\ncan only learn from a fixed set of samples and labels, making them unsuitable\nfor the real world, where data arrives as a stream of samples often associated\nwith multiple labels over time. This motivates the study of task-agnostic\ncontinual multi-label learning problems. While algorithms using deep learning\napproaches for continual multi-label learning have been proposed in the recent\nliterature, they tend to be computationally heavy. Although spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) offer a computationally efficient alternative to artificial\nneural networks, existing literature has not used SNNs for continual\nmulti-label learning. Also, accurately determining multiple labels with SNNs is\nstill an open research problem. This work proposes a dual output spiking\narchitecture (DOSA) to bridge these research gaps. A novel imbalance-aware loss\nfunction is also proposed, improving the multi-label classification performance\nof the model by making it more robust to data imbalance. A modified F1 score is\npresented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function in\nhandling imbalance. Experiments on several benchmark multi-label datasets show\nthat DOSA trained with the proposed loss function shows improved robustness to\ndata imbalance and obtains better continual multi-label learning performance\nthan CIFDM, a previous state-of-the-art algorithm.",

Most existing methods based on Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nare difficult to implement in the real world due to unrealistic assumptions,\nsuch as having access to environment dynamics, reward signals, and online\ninteractions with the environment. To address these limitations, we propose an\nunsupervised method named Offline Imitation Learning based Anomaly Detection\n(OIL-AD), which detects anomalies in decision-making sequences using two\nextracted behaviour features: action optimality and sequential association. Our\noffline learning model is an adaptation of behavioural cloning with a\ntransformer policy network, where we modify the training process to learn a Q\nfunction and a state value function from normal trajectories. We propose that\nthe Q function and the state value function can provide sufficient information\nabout agents' behavioural data, from which we derive two features for anomaly\ndetection. The intuition behind our method is that the action optimality\nfeature derived from the Q function can differentiate the optimal action from\nothers at each local state, and the sequential association feature derived from\nthe state value function has the potential to maintain the temporal\ncorrelations between decisions (state-action pairs).

Hence, the gradient calculated by\nthe agent can be stochastic and without valid information. Recent studies that\nutilize memory buffers of previous experiences can lead to a more efficient\nlearning process. However, existing methods often require these experiences to\nbe successful and may overly exploit them, which can cause the agent to adopt\nsuboptimal behaviors. This paper develops an approach that uses diverse past\ntrajectories for faster and more efficient online RL, even if these\ntrajectories are suboptimal or not highly rewarded. The proposed algorithm\ncombines a policy improvement step with an additional exploration step using\noffline demonstration data. The main contribution of this paper is that by\nregarding diverse past trajectories as guidance, instead of imitating them, our\nmethod directs its policy to follow and expand past trajectories while still\nbeing able to learn without rewards and approach optimality. Furthermore, a\nnovel diversity measurement is introduced to maintain the team's diversity and\nregulate exploration. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on discrete and\ncontinuous control tasks with sparse and deceptive rewards. Compared with the\nexisting RL methods, the experimental results indicate that our proposed\nalgorithm is significantly better than the baseline methods regarding diverse\nexploration and avoiding local optima.",

This is a challenging task due to the need to\ninteract with granular media, and doing so based exclusively on tactile\nfeedback, since a buried object can be completely hidden from vision. Tactile\nfeedback is in itself challenging in this context, due to ubiquitous contact\nwith the surrounding media, and the inherent noise level induced by the tactile\nreadings. To address these challenges, we use a learning method trained\nend-to-end with simulated sensor noise. We show that our problem formulation\nleads to the natural emergence of learned pushing behaviors that the\nmanipulator uses to reduce uncertainty and funnel the object to a stable grasp\ndespite spurious and noisy tactile readings. We also introduce a training\ncurriculum that enables learning these behaviors in simulation, followed by\nzero-shot transfer to real hardware. To the best of our knowledge, GEOTACT is\nthe first method to reliably retrieve a number of different objects from a\ngranular environment, doing so on real hardware and with integrated tactile\nsensing.

The advent of software-defined networking (SDN) and programmable\nswitches enables flexibility and programmability. However, traditional\ntechniques that decide traffic policies are usually based on hand-crafted\nprogramming optimization and heuristic algorithms. These techniques make\nnon-realistic assumptions, e.g., considering static network load and topology,\nto obtain tractable solutions, which are inadequate for next-gen networks. In\nthis paper, we design and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach\nfor adaptive traffic routing. We design a deep graph convolutional neural\nnetwork (DGCNN) integrated into the DRL framework to learn the traffic behavior\nfrom not only the network topology but also link and node attributes. We adopt\nthe Deep Q-Learning technique to train the DGCNN model in the DRL framework\nwithout the need for a labeled training dataset, enabling the framework to\nquickly adapt to traffic dynamics. The model leverages q-value estimates to\nselect the routing path for every traffic flow request, balancing exploration\nand exploitation. We perform extensive experiments with various traffic\npatterns and compare the performance of the proposed approach with the Open\nShortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. The experimental results show the\neffectiveness and adaptiveness of the proposed framework by increasing the\nnetwork throughput by up to 7.8% and reducing the traffic delay by up to 16.1%\ncompared to OSPF.",
